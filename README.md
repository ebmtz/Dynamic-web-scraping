# Dynamic-web-scraping
This project is meant to explore the possibility of automated web-scraping based off of simple `NLP` analysis such as `cosine similarity` between tf-idf vectors.


This project came about from a school project. Our goal was to the `Scrapy` library in Python to automate the aquisition of data from relatively structured sites with no API. Next, we aimed to demonstrate an example of how that might look for a task like sentiment analysis.

In short, we developed a web-scraping tool that targets the web-domains of news sites like CNN, Fox News, Politico etc. Look over our pptx presentation for some more context.

This repo is currently getting documented and polished, but feel free to reach out with any questions!
