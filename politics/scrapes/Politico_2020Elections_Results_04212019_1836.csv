0,‘The Democratic base is angry as hell’: Cory Booker’s message of love falls flat,"['\n                Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker speaks during the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus Reception on April 16 in Des Moines, Iowa. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo', '\n                    By ', 'SIOUX CITY, IOWA — Sen. Cory Booker launched a bid for the White House in February on a message of love and unity, painting himself as an inspirational leader who would help a polarized America find common ground. ', ' Just 10 weeks later, Booker is discovering that so far love just isn’t enough. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Polling in the single digits and lagging top-tier competitors in fundraising, Booker this week sought to reboot his campaign, launching a “Justice For All” two-week, national tour heavy on economic policy proposals and social justice messaging. In Iowa, he rolled out an expansive proposal for a new income tax credit and talked about the need for rural infrastructure investment. In Georgia, he unveiled a voting rights plan, vowing to make Election Day a national holiday and talked about restoring voting rights to ex-felons. ', ' The recent steps aim to invigorate a presidential bid that has underwhelmed some Democrats who are questioning whether Booker’s message is one that resonates in the Trump era.', 'Booker kicked off his presidential bid on Feb. 1 framing his run on the proposition that the nation’s next leader needed to tap into ways to reunite an ever-divided country. Booker, who often references Martin Luther King Jr., is shaping his candidacy as one that seeks to bring back civic grace and discourse, saying that political tribalism in America runs so deep “we can’t even do the things that we agree on.”', ' “Right now what this country needs is not people having a race to the gutter, not a party that’s going to show the worst of who they are, not when they go low we go lower, not fighting fire with fire,” he said at a recent Iowa campaign stop. ', ' It’s a tricky platform to execute, said Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. While he said Booker’s messaging is “compelling,” it comes at a political moment when the party is hungry for candidates to offer up evidence that they can defeat President Donald Trump. ', ' “The Democratic base is angry as hell and we’re fighting for our lives,” Bagniewski said. “That’s how it feels every day. The primary voters are angry and they want to fight.” ', ' At an Iowa town hall this week, one potential caucus-goer commented on Booker’s approach, telling him that “while we love your love message,” tackling issues like climate change “has to be our first priority.”', ' Even the senator acknowledged he’s been second-guessed on his messaging.', ' “‘That’s not a strategy to win, Cory. You’re fighting against Donald Trump. How you gonna to win?’” Booker said people will ask him. “And I say, ‘please, I’m the guy who beat this machine in Newark, New Jersey.’” ', ' Booker told that Iowa crowd he believes the election has to be about something more than just ousting Trump from the White House. ', ' “We have a choice in this election. To make it about one guy and one election and just get rid of him? I understand that call, but it’s got to be about something bigger than that,” Booker said. “We Democrats in this room, it can’t just be about beating Republicans, no. This is a moral moment in our country where it’s got to be about uniting Americans.” ', ' A March ', ' in Iowa backs up Booker’s premise: 50 percent of those surveyed said it was “absolutely critical” that a 2020 candidate is “someone who can heal the racial, ethnic and partisan divide in our country.”', "" Still, as he moves into the second quarter of the most crowded and diverse Democratic presidential primary in history, Booker is finding that the skills he's long tapped as an orator with a mayor’s flair for finding human connection so far hasn’t been enough to break through. On top of a slew of other U.S. senators in the race, fresh faces like former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are deploying similar retail traits to dazzle prospective voters. "", ' So far, according to polls, O’Rourke and Buttigieg have ranked above Booker, who also trails top tier candidates in the race including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.', ' Booker’s first-quarter $5 million fundraising haul came in toward the low end of the expansive Democratic field and while his campaign says his polling numbers qualified him for the national debate stage, he’s trailing in the small-dollar fundraising contest that’s reflecting strength in many of his competitors’ campaigns.', ' With that in mind, Booker has shifted toward a more policy-heavy agenda in his two-week tour across the country that will take him to early presidential states and the South.', ' In an Iowa event on tax day, Booker unrolled an expansive income tax credit, proposing to raise the Earned Income Tax Credit by 25 percent, aiming to significantly reach more people. ', ' “We should be having the biggest increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit and that’s what I’m proposing, by making sure that anybody who works gets back from the government – if you’re earning more than $50,000 a year, or if you’re a couple, $90,000 a year -- you will get a tax credit in this country,” he said. Then he gently jabbed at the crowd for failing to react. “And by the way, before you even applaud, let me tell you,” he said to laughter. ', ' Even as Booker sought a recharge in Iowa, he was overshadowed by Buttigieg, whose unexpected surge drew among the biggest crowds for Democratic 2020 candidates touring the first-in-the-nation primary state. ', ' “I think part of it is the newness factor. We have a lot of great candidates in the field who are pretty well known. Pete’s bubbled up because he’s new and different. But also his demeanor, he’s very chill, has a great sense of humor but he’s very knowledgeable,” said Vanessa Phelan, chair of Northwest Des Moines Democrats. ', ' Phelan noted that while Buttigieg’s crowd was unexpectedly large, she’s seen many of the same people attending events for 2020 candidates as they’re still shopping around. Asked if Democrats wanted to hear Booker’s message of love and unity, she said they do – but that they want more.

', ' For months, the premier political question haunting Democrats — aside from Hillary Clinton’s yes-or-no decision on 2016 — has been whether Obama’s unprecedented support from young people, women and nonwhite voters will roll over into a new campaign, with a new candidate at the top of the ticket. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' After this week, senior Democrats say, it had better. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The president’s decision to use his executive powers to protect some 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation is bound to draw a backlash from middle-of-the-road white voters. Republicans assailed Obama’s handling of immigration in the midterm elections, catering to a conservative and notably less diverse electorate with ads in states such as Arkansas and New Hampshire. Early polling shows significant suspicion of Obama’s unilateral action: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent of Americans pre-emptively opposed to the executive actions, versus 38 percent ready to endorse them. ', ' As a political matter, then, the president’s wager is this: that the voters with the longest memories will be those in the rapidly growing, next-generation national electorate, heavily inflected by socially progressive young people and a growing Latino population. ', ' For all the predictable blowback Democrats will face across the South and even in areas of the Rust Belt, strategists hope the party will be rewarded handsomely in states that have swung rapidly toward their party in national elections thanks to accelerating demographic change. That may be small consolation to red-state senators like North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp or West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, who may have to defend the policy when they run for reelection in a few years. ', ' But Clinton, the most formidable Democratic figure on the political horizon, channeled the enthusiasm of most party leaders in a statement Thursday night endorsing Obama’s “decision to begin fixing our broken immigration system” — and blaming Republicans for the failure to pass comprehensive reform. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Other 2016-minded Democrats hasten to explain the electoral upside for their party: Think of states like Florida and Virginia, they say, places that once leaned conservative but have moved rapidly toward the center (and perhaps beyond) with the expansion of nonwhite communities in the Washington, D.C., suburbs and cities such as Tampa and Orlando. Or, for Senate Democrats, look to the two top states in which the party will play defense in 2016 — Nevada and Colorado — where the dominance of Las Vegas-based Clark County and the diversifying Denver suburbs hold the keys to reelection for Sens. Harry Reid and Michael Bennet. ', ' Even more optimistic Democrats say: Consider states such as Georgia and Arizona, currently red states where the trend lines of population change are likely to let a strong Democratic presidential candidate not named Obama compete in 2016. The party would need strong, motivating issues to bring out often-discouraged minority voters; for Hispanic-Americans, immigration certainly qualifies. ', ' Steve Schale, the Democratic strategist who twice led Obama’s campaigns in Florida, said he doubts the party would face meaningful, long-term backlash from white voters over the immigration decision — at least, not from white voters the party would have any chance of winning over in the first place. The constituencies most directly affected by Obama’s orders, Schale said, won’t suffer from the same amnesia. ', ' “It’s a move that will be welcomed by Hispanics in Florida in the same way that Hispanics in Florida were disappointed by the decision to put it off during the [2014] election,” Schale predicted, noting: “The decision to delay immigration reform certainly didn’t appear to help us with certain elements of white voters during 2014.” ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Mo Elleithee, the Democratic National Committee’s communications director, vowed that the GOP would pay a price for its heated attacks on the White House’s policy: “The rhetoric coming out will come back to haunt them. We are capturing every bit and will make them answer for it. They are not just alienating, they are offending, the [Hispanic] community.” ', ' Republicans believe that Obama is inviting deep punishment with his actions this week. Not only does the GOP sense genuine anger among voters about the ongoing mess on the border, but party leaders say Obama’s orders will look like pure arrogance, the brazen actions of a discredited president. ', ' Though the GOP has struggled to assemble a viable, diverse coalition in national elections, the party is on a hot streak in large, traditionally Democratic states across the Midwest — big, blue-collar battlegrounds like Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, where a certain segment of Democratic-leaning, populist white voters may recoil from what they perceive as overreach on the border. ', '\n  ', ' ', ' And even Democrats who are enthusiastic about the implications of a national showdown on immigration in a presidential year recognize that the issue has plainly dangerous consequences in off-year races, particularly House and Senate races fought outside of urban America and the Latino-inflected Sun Belt. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Other senior Democratic strategists involved in the immigration fight expressed skepticism that restive independent voters would cling to their concerns over the executive actions. If they currently show resistance to the scope and aggressiveness of Obama’s orders, the Democrat said, that’s likely to fade over time as the issue fades from talk radio and the Fox News chyron. ', ' And in any case, the composition of the national electorate continues to change to the benefit of a party that’s lenient on immigration, legal or otherwise. The presidential vote has grown steadily less white and steadily more Hispanic over the past two decades. In 1992, 87 percent of presidential voters were white, while 2 percent were Hispanic. Twenty years later, white voters represented 72 percent of the electorate, while 10 percent were Hispanic (13 percent were black and 3 percent Asian). ', ' So while a national election polarized around border issues might once have spelled doom for Democrats, the party believes the basic lines of national politics have changed to the point where something like the opposite is true. ', ' William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who has studied what he calls a “cultural generation gap” on diversity and immigration, said Obama’s orders represented a decisive wager on the newly emerging electorate. ', ' “They think they will probably take some hits, but that longer-term, their base is the future,” Frey said. “That’s probably the calculation they are making with this.” ', ' Democratic pollster Geoff Garin went a few steps further, declaring that by 2016 the debate will have returned to a place where his party can go on offense. Republicans have already lurched right this year on immigration, voting to end Obama’s policy of suspending deportations for undocumented minors. Digging in against the substance of this week’s orders, Garin said, will ultimately put Republicans on the wrong side of a debate about whether the government should deport millions of Latinos from the country. ', ' “The polling is very clear that even among voters who have reservations about executive power, there is support for the underlying policy,” said Garin, an adviser to the 2012 Obama super PAC Priorities USA. “One of the impacts of the president’s action is that Republicans will have moved from a policy of self-deportation, in Mitt Romney’s terms from 2012, to a policy of actual deportation. That’s the fundamental meaning of their opposition to what Obama is doing.” ', '\n  ', ' ', ' There’s precedent for eruptions of border-hawk ire followed by energetic mobilization among Latino voters and progressive allies. Polls throughout the 2010 midterm election showed strong support for enforcement crackdowns like the one Arizona pioneered that year, with a law allowing law enforcement officers to check the citizenship status of persons they detain. It was taken by some as a warning sign for Democrats intent on pursuing comprehensive reform. ', ' But two years later, public polling in swing states such as Ohio and Florida showed voters supportive of an apparently contradictory Obama decision to defer deportations for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors. That executive action was credited with helping re-energize the president’s campaign and driving a spike in Latino turnout. Nevada legislator Lucy Flores, who just lost a race for lieutenant governor, said the absence of a motivator like that — indeed, Obama’s explicit decision to postpone his executive actions — hurt Hispanic turnout this year. ', ' “I wish this wasn’t a partisan thing, but it is,” she said, forecasting that this week’s announcement would help reelect Harry Reid in 2016. “It’s very apparent that Democrats have been leading the way on this issue … Republicans are not doing anything.” ', ' Ben Monterroso, executive director of the advocacy group Mi Familia Vota, put it in starker terms than that. ', ' “People will see Obama did it and fear Republicans could undo it,” Monterroso said. “It will be very clear in 2016 who is with us and who is against us.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

A consensus is forming within the Republican Party that the plan of attack against Hillary Clinton should be of a more recent vintage, rooted in her accumulation of wealth and designed to frame her as removed from the concerns of average Americans. ', ' With close to 20 announced and prospective GOP candidates in 2016, there’s no singular, unified messaging effort yet. But interviews with GOP consultants, party officials and the largest conservative super PACs point to an emerging narrative of a wealthy, out-of-touch candidate who plays by her own set of rules and lives in a world of private planes, chauffeured vehicles and million-dollar homes. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The out-of-touch plutocrat template is a familiar one: Democrats used it to devastating effect against Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. While Hillary Clinton’s residences in New York and Washington may not have car elevators, there’s still a lengthy trail of paid speeches, tone-deaf statements about the family finances and questions about Clinton family foundation fundraising practices that will serve as cornerstones of the anti-Clinton messaging effort. ', ' “She’s admitted she hasn’t driven a car for decades; she probably doesn’t ever go into a coffee shop and talk to regular people unless it’s for a staged photo-op,” said American Crossroads CEO Steven Law, alluding to Clinton’s portrayal in her campaign’s launch video on Sunday. “She really has lived the life of a 1-percenter these last several years, and it shows. ', ' “We know her team is working to rebrand her as a relatable, regular person; the question is, can she actually perform in a way that convinces people she is that person? We think that’s going to be hard for her.” ', ' The outlines of the effort to Mitt Romnify Hillary Clinton are still being sketched. Crossroads, the super PAC that spent $70 million in 2012 mostly on television ads attacking President Barack Obama, is in the middle of an extensive research project analyzing voters’ existing perceptions of Clinton and their reactions to a number of potential critiques. But the Republican National Committee has done focus groups that suggest Clinton is more vulnerable to charges of being imperious and bending the rules than anything else tested against her. ', ' “The most potent message against Clinton is that she doesn’t live an average life, she’s out of touch and doesn’t play by the same set of rules,” said the RNC’s research director, Raj Shah. “[T]hat resonates more deeply than some of the policy hits, the ethical hits.” ', ' Sen. Rand Paul — who announced his own 2016 bid Tuesday — is planning to trace the edges of the GOP argument in cable television ads that will run in four early voting states this week. “Hillary Rodham Clinton represents the worst of the Washington machine. The arrogance of power, corruption, cover up. Conflicts of interest,” the spots say. “The Washington machine is destroying the American dream.” ', ' and ', ' As early as Sunday night, just hours after her digital campaign launch, the rapid response team at America Rising — the opposition research super PAC that’s been focused on Clinton since its 2013 launch — corrected news reports that Clinton “was driving to Iowa” in a van by reminding reporters that she hasn’t actually gotten behind a steering wheel herself in 19 years. ', ' America Rising has sifted through nearly three decades of statements by Clinton, sorting and stockpiling audio and video clips that can and will be fired off as part of the group’s effort to keep the likely Democratic nominee back on her heels. The super PAC is uniquely suited for the job — its founder and chairman, Matt Rhoades, is Romney’s former campaign manager. ', ' Clinton herself provided some of the choicest and freshest material. The subject of her growing wealth forced Clinton into a defensive posture while on a book tour last year, leading to a tin-eared remark about being “not that well off” despite being paid $200,000 per speech and receiving an $8 million advance on the book itself. ', ' She explained that she and Bill Clinton earned their millions “through dint of hard work.” ', ' “Who talks like that?” said GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who advised Romney’s campaign in 2012. “Most Americans don’t understand accumulating millions in wealth through speaking fees. Hillary Clinton has not driven a car in this century; how can she relate to the cost of gas? How can she relate to rising food prices when she doesn’t shop for herself?” ', ' Republicans view new questions about the Clinton Foundation’s fundraising efforts — especially donations from foreign governments Hillary Clinton did official business with while leading the State Department — as equally damning, perhaps even evoking long-forgotten memories of a president who rewarded his biggest donors with stays in the Lincoln bedroom. ', ' “There is so much at that nexus of politics and money and she hasn’t had to answer for it yet,” said Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising. “It will remind voters of what they didn’t like about the Clinton era.” ', ' The GOP also intends to mine last month’s revelation that Clinton used her private email address and server to conduct business as secretary of state, then deleted thousands of emails she deemed to be personal. The controversy has already put a dent in her poll numbers: According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 56 percent of Colorado voters said she is not honest and trustworthy. ', ' “The importance of the emails wasn’t people concluding that she’d done something wrong but that it reinforces the old idea of the Clintons as people who play by their own set of rules,” said Ed Goeas, president and CEO of The Tarrance Group, a GOP polling firm. ', ' Republicans, however, admit to having serious concerns about whether the party — with its disparate voices and constituencies — is disciplined enough to maintain the proper tone, or to sustain a cohesive message against a tested opponent who, for all her vulnerabilities, remains a formidable candidate. ', ' “It’s going to be a real challenge for Republicans to strike the right balance,” said Dick Wadhams, a former Colorado GOP chairman and longtime operative in the West. “We cannot have a candidate who comes across like [Clinton’s GOP opponent in New York’s 2000 U.S. Senate race] Rick Lazio, marching across the debate stage and getting in Hillary’s face. We have to be aware of how the optics are different when going after a woman.” ', ' California-based strategist Rob Stutzman agreed that the calibration of the attacks matters a great deal. ', ' “We’ve got to be careful not to make it too personal,” he said. “The voters we’re talking to in the primary don’t like Hillary Clinton, but we can’t lose sight of the fact that she’s well-respected in American politics and she’s earned that.” ', ' Operatives worry that over-the-top attacks — namely, references to her age or the Monica Lewinsky scandal — will simply serve to generate sympathy for Clinton.

0,Immigration debacle dogs Rubio,"['\n                        ', '\n                        But even tea party critics say he’s contained the damage and it may not be a deal-breaker with GOP voters.', '\n                    By MANU RAJU and SEUNG MIN KIM', '\n                    Updated ', 'The calls started coming from Republican Party honchos and prominent GOP senators right after Election 2012: The party had to start competing better for the Latino vote, and immigration reform was the place to start. ', ' Sen. Marco Rubio’s political advisers weren’t so sure. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' As a pair of deal-making Republicans deeply disliked by elements of the GOP base — Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham — were working with senators from both parties to draft an immigration bill, top Rubio hands flatly warned the Florida freshman not to go there. The advisers feared nothing would be worse for his chances in a potential presidential campaign than being associated with “amnesty” for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. ', ' Rubio didn’t take the advice. And two years later, immigration remains the freshman senator’s No. 1 liability in his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination — though not necessarily the deal breaker it appeared to be after the reform effort Rubio helped shepherd to passage in the Senate hit a brick wall in the House. ', ' “Everybody likes Marco Rubio,” said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated commentator. But “I still don’t hear his name from conservatives at all, and I think the Gang of Eight” — the bipartisan group of senators that pushed the most sweeping immigration overhaul in a generation — “has a lot to do with that.” ', ' Even so, the political damage to Rubio has clearly subsided over time, in no small part due to Rubio’s repeated disavowal of the entire reform exercise. In the days ahead of his presidential campaign launch in Miami Monday evening, some critics on the tea party right concede he has resuscitated himself politically, though the true effect may not be apparent until much deeper into the 2016 primary season. ', ' “What I think everyone over here underestimated is how difficult it is to pass massive pieces of legislation on any subject — not just immigration — given the rightful distrust the people have about the federal government,” Rubio said in a recent interview in the Capitol. ', ' Said Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots: “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do: He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.” ', ' Still, even if immigration won’t be a central message of his presidential campaign, it will be an inescapable part of his record and his own personal narrative. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio announced his presidential run at the Freedom Tower in Miami — an Ellis Island of the South that served as a welcoming point for Cuban exiles into America. ', ' The issue is also bound to be re-litigated by his opponents and voters, as it has during early appearances this year at a New Hampshire town hall and Iowa book signing. When pressed on the matter on the campaign trail, Rubio plans to tell voters that the comprehensive bill he co-authored will never pass Congress. ', ' In his latest book, “American Dreams,” Rubio argues that the approach he took in 2013 on immigration — one single bill to reform the entire system — was “simply not realistic.” He can assert that, Rubio says, because he knows of the experience firsthand. ', ' “Every massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,” Rubio said in the interview. ', ' Instead, Rubio is renewing an argument he made originally that Congress should take up immigration reform in pieces, starting with proposals that Republicans largely support such as enforcement at the southern border, a mandatory electronic system to verify the legal status of employees and a new method to track people who overstay their visas. He’ll argue that deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally is improbable, and call for an onerous series of steps to allow some to stay in the country. And a President Rubio would only entertain that possibility of citizenship after a enforcement-minded immigration laws are enacted first. ', ' Such talk — and his decision to back away away from his own bill — seem to have alleviated some concern on the right that Rubio is not another McCain or Graham. ', ' Yet it’s also opened him to charges that the GOP lawmaker flip-flopped on the issue when the political temperature got too hot – simply to pander to the base of the party, and potentially leaving himself vulnerable to Latino voters in a general election. ', ' In June 2013, the same month that his immigration bill passed the Senate, a ', ' showed that his “strongly favorable” ratings among Republicans had tumbled by 11 points since the previous August. ', ' Rubio began to make amends with conservatives. Immediately after the bill passed the chamber, he shifted his attention to a range of economic reforms and other matters. He refused to call on the GOP-led House to pass the Senate bill, even as the other seven co-authors planned an aggressive public pressure campaign on House Republicans. ', ' Rubio blamed President Barack Obama for scuttling the bill’s chances, saying no conservative trusts the White House to implement the border control provisions. Republicans in the House agreed. ', ' His shift to the right didn’t stop there. At the height of last summer’s border crisis, Rubio called for the 2012 Obama administration program that halts deportations of young undocumented immigrants — an initiative highly popular with Latinos — to eventually end. ', ' Critics say his handling of immigration feeds the perception that Rubio lacks any significant legislative accomplishments in his short time in the Senate. And immigration activists who were once impressed with Rubio for taking on the politically fraught task of writing a reform bill now see him as a sell-out. ', 'MICHAEL GRUNWALD and ', ' “Every time he gets on his knees and begs for forgiveness from the nativist right in the GOP, I cringe,” said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate who leads America’s Voice, a left-leaning, pro-reform group. “He will always be known as the guy who stood up for something he seemed to believe in and backed down when it was politically convenient to do so.” ', ' It’s unclear how Rubio would fare among Latino voters if he were to win the GOP nomination. The polling firm Latino Decisions found in a November survey of Latino voters that Rubio is viewed favorably by 31 percent of Latinos vs. 36 percent who saw him unfavorably. About one-third of those voters had not heard of Rubio, or had any opinion on the senator. ', ' Despite concerns for some on the right, public polls show the senator still has a serious chance to win a wide-open race. A ', ' from March showed that 56 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Rubio — a higher figure than received by any other of the 13 GOP contenders listed by the poll. ', ' Perhaps that’s because Rubio has moved to ensure he’s not identified strictly with the immigration issue. He’s been laying out economic reform ideas, from making higher education more affordable to helping narrow the income gap. At the same time, he has maintained his staunchly conservative views on social issues and foreign policy. ', ' “I’m struck by how much he has recovered,” said Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, who two years ago ', ' to “walk away” from the Gang of Eight. ', ' “It’s hard to put your finger on it, but there do seem to be some politicians whom lots of voters want to like and are eager to forgive for their mistakes,” Kristol said, citing Ronald Reagan as an example. “Others who are less likable get held to a stricter standard. So Rubio’s apparent comeback over the last couple of years may indicate a kind of underlying strength there that one might not have expected.” ', ' Yet, Rubio is still likely to be the left of the likes of Ted Cruz when it comes to immigration reform. ', ' In “American Dreams,” Rubio said he would address immigrants already here illegally once Congress has passed enforcement proposals and turned the current legal immigration system into one based on merit and economic considerations, not family ties. ', ' At that point, he said he would institute a system to register those here illegally, deporting ones who have committed serious crimes or who have not been in the United States long enough. Undocumented immigrants who pay a fine, learn English and undergo background checks could then obtain a temporary legal status, something they would have to hold for at least 10 years before applying for permanent residence. ', ' Rubio said he would not create a so-called special pathway, meaning a way to obtain citizenship that isn’t afforded to other immigrants. That highly contentious provision — to provide a pathway to citizenship — was included in the Gang of Eight proposal. ', ' “He not going to run away from it, he’s going to talk about it,” said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project’s Latino Partnership, a group that advocates for conservative causes among Latinos. “He’s going to continue to say that it’s important to deal with the issue.” ', ' Aguilar, who has lobbied GOP lawmakers on immigration reform, said Rubio should have tried harder to recruit other conservative Republicans to the Gang of Eight so he wasn’t the sole emissary charged with selling the bill to the right. One target might have been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was considered part of the group in its early stages. ', ' But still, many Republicans said Rubio should get political credit for at least trying to solve a tough issue. ', ' “What cannot be denied is that while many of his colleagues will be critical, they have yet to propose any viable solution to a problem that everybody in the United States understands is there,” said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who is backing Jeb Bush but says he’s a “huge admirer” of his home-state senator. “Rubio had the courage to take on a very, very controversial issue.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

What’s the point?” \n ', ' ', ' Paul laid out a staunchly conservative vision that he said was also inclusive, aimed at empowering poorer Americans through greater education and economic opportunities. \n ', ' ', ', ', ' and ', ' To underscore that point, a diverse crowd of supporters was seated behind Paul, showing the cross section of voters to whom Paul is trying to appeal. The staging choice highlighted Paul’s central challenge in the GOP nominating fight - claiming the conservative mantle while winning over a wider group of voters than his father did. \n ', ' ', ' Ron Paul spent more than three decades as a marginalized player in the House of Representatives, in part due to his non-interventionist foreign policy. He had a devoted national following but fell far short of contending in his 2008 and 2012 GOP bids and in his 1988 presidential run as Libertarian party nominee. Even in 2012, at the height of his popularity, Ron Paul failed to win the popular vote in a single state. \n ', ' ', ' The elder Paul did not figure prominently in the production on Tuesday. He was seated on the outer edge of the stage and did not have a speaking role, though Rand Paul briefly thanked his parents for their help getting him through medical school. \n ', ' ', ' Still, Rand Paul, 52, hit on some of the same themes associated with his father, who departed Congress in 2013 but continues to deliver speeches and write doom-and-gloom columns about the dangers posed by the federal government. \n ', ' ', ' “Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration and is now tripling under Barack Obama’s watch,” Paul said, in an apparent jab at former President George W. Bush whose brother Jeb is a 2016 contender. “We’ve come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank.” \n ', ' ', ' Paul’s announcement makes him the second official candidate in the Republican field. Fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz launched his campaign last month, and a third Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, is expected to announce his bid next week. \n ', ' ', ' The reaction from the other contenders was generally muted. Before the rally, Cruz emailed a statement welcoming his “friend Rand Paul” into the primary. “His entry into the race will no doubt raise the bar of competition, help make us all stronger, and ultimately ensure that the GOP nominee is equipped to beat Hillary Clinton and to take back the White House for Republicans in 2016,” Cruz said. \n ', ' ', ' Democrats were quick to blast Paul, saying that while he touts himself as a “different” kind of Republican, his policies are still harmful. “This is a classic example of a GOP presidential candidate thinking he can talk his way into our communities while turning his back on us when it comes to his policy prescriptions,” said Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement. \n ', ' ', ' So far, Paul is trailing in the polls behind both establishment candidates and those considered long shots. A Fox News poll from last week showed Paul pulling 9 percent of the vote among likely GOP voters, behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 15 percent, former Florida Gov. Bush at 12 percent, neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 11 percent, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Cruz at 10 percent. \n ', ' ', ' He is also seen as a less attractive target for big donor checks. Paul has ventured into Democratic-leaning territory — particularly Silicon Valley — to seek donations from libertarian-leaning power brokers there. He is also betting on online fundraising to be competitive. \n ', ' ', ' The rally on Tuesday was a manifestation of his attempt to broaden and boost his standing, particularly among young and minority voters. It’s hard to remember a Republican candidate who has so highlighted diversity in a campaign launch: on the stage behind him were women, blacks, and young people – all voting blocs that have broken sharply away from Republicans in recent elections. He promised to be a different kind of GOP figure, and said that Democratic policies had failed minorities. \n ', ' ', ' “Those of us who have enjoyed the American Dream must break down the wall that separates us from ‘the other America,’” said Paul, who has made reforming the criminal justice system — which he says unfairly targets minorities — a central theme of his burgeoning campaign. \n ', ' ', ' Paul also addressed foreign policy, an issue that has exposed him to attacks from rivals who say he’s too dovish and too like his father. On Tuesday, Paul — who has previously articulated a non-interventionist approach and has called for cuts to Pentagon spending — struck a delicate balance. \n ', ' ', ' “We need a national defense robust enough to defend against all attack, modern enough to deter all enemies, and nimble enough to defend our vital interests,” he said. “But we also need a foreign policy that protects American interests and encourages stability — not chaos.” \n ', ' ', ' On Thursday, Paul will try to bolster his foreign policy credibility by staging a campaign event at a venue rich with military symbolism: The deck of the U.S.S.Yorktown, a World War II-era aircraft carrier stationed in South Carolina. \n ', ' ', '\n  ', ' ', ' The Kentucky senator’s rise has been meteoric. After spending nearly two decades as a physician and anti-tax activist, he catapulted to national prominence during the 2010 midterms and became the face of an ascendant tea party movement. That year, he demolished then-Secretary of State Trey Grayson, the handpicked choice of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, in the primary; In the fall, he easily prevailed over state Attorney General Jack Conway, a Democrat, in the general election. \n ', ' ', ' Paul immediately made a splash in the Senate, becoming the chamber’s leading libertarian voice. In March 2013, he drew headlines for staging a nearly 13-hour filibuster in which he protested the Obama administration’s use of drone strikes. \n ', ' ', ' Many Republicans see Paul’s task as threading a needle as he tries to maintain the support of tea party activists and libertarians who propelled him to power while also expanding beyond their base of support. \n ', ' ', ' “His victory lies in his ability to enthuse enough self-identified independents to the polls while keeping his father’s followers satisfied and skeptics of his foreign policy stances muted,” said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who worked on Newt Gingrich’s 2012 campaign. \n ', ' ', ' The balancing act may prove challenging. John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who has worked for several past presidential candidates, pointed out that even if Paul fared strongly in conservative early primary states he would need to find a path in the larger, more politically and demographically complex states that succeeded them on the calendar. \n ', ' ', ' “He’s cliff diving into large multi-state primaries,” McLaughlin said, “that will determine whether or not he has broad national appeal.” \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

0,Cruz's strategy: Destroy the 'mushy middle',"['\n                    By JAMES HOHMANN and ', '\n                    Updated ', '\n                Cruz is not closely identified with issues like abortion and has not been covered as one of the evangelical candidates in the 2016 field.', 'LYNCHBURG, Va. — Ted Cruz premises his presidential hopes on the proposition that anti-establishment voters of all stripes won’t settle again for a nominee like Mitt Romney or John McCain. And the Texas senator believes that he has as good a chance as anyone to emerge as the leading alternative to Jeb Bush or whoever else becomes the favorite of what he likes to call “the mushy middle.” \n ', ' ', ' Cruz is not closely identified with issues like abortion and has not been covered as one of the evangelical candidates in the 2016 field. So his decision to formally kick off his presidential campaign at Liberty University in rural Virginia on Monday surprised many Republicans, including social conservative stalwarts from the camps of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Advisers to the 44-year-old say he is not trying to repackage himself as primarily a social conservative. Instead, the senator’s team sees four brackets in the GOP primary field: the tea party, evangelicals, libertarians and establishment Republicans. The goal, they explain, is to establish Cruz as the first choice of tea partyers and become at least the second choice of evangelicals. \n ', ' ', ' Winning over the establishment — which still blames him for the federal government shutdown of 2013 — and libertarians — who remain relatively loyal to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — will be very tough, Cruz strategists concede. The goal is to become the main conservative alternative to whoever emerges as the establishment candidate, whether that’s the former Florida governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \n ', ' ', ' “We believe we have a clear path to victory and have the ability to raise the money to get our message out,” said Cruz senior adviser Jason Miller. “So we’re full steam ahead.” \n ', ' ', ' Cruz undeniably enters this contest as a dark horse. Just two of 50 Iowans surveyed in The POLITICO Caucus — a weekly focus group of the most plugged-in people in the two states that kick off the nominating process — think he would win the caucuses if they were held this week. None of the insiders in New Hampshire believe he’d win the primary if it was this week. He’s often low in the pack in early polling, though that is not worth much at this stage. \n ', ' ', ' He sees himself in the mold of Ronald Reagan circa 1979, or perhaps 1975, in that he is not taken seriously by Washington Republicans but that he appeals to independents and other nontraditional voters who like the way he speaks truth to power and never goes along to get along. \n ', ' ', ' The party establishment sees Cruz as more akin to George McGovern in 1972, someone on the extreme fringe who is congenitally unable to compromise and could never win a general election. They point to ', ' to argue that he’s fundamentally unserious. They call the 2013 government shutdown a PR mess for the party, though Cruz likes to note that Republicans took control of the Senate just 13 months later. \n ', ' ', ' Anger ', ' at Cruz in the GOP conference this past December when he forced a weekend session in an unsuccessful attempt to defund President Barack Obama’s executive order on immigration. His own colleagues publicly criticized him for not being strategic and for making everyone’s weekend “miserable.” \n ', ' ', ' Texas’ senior senator, John Cornyn, said Monday that he will stay neutral and has ', ' to endorse Cruz, who declined to endorse Cornyn in his own GOP primary last year. \n ', ' ', ' But as Hillary Clinton looks weaker and more beatable, because of the email problems and a host of other scandals, Cruz hopes that the Republican base begins to coalesce behind someone like him. If they think that anyone can beat Clinton, the thinking goes, why not back the most outspoken conservative? \n ', ' ', ' Cruz’s advisers believe he can outmaneuver Walker and Paul in the early states. The sense within Cruz’s team is that he’s more ready for prime time and more polished on the stump than other rivals. \n ', ' ', ' Since entering the Senate two years ago, the Texan has positioned himself to be the most ideologically pure candidate in the wide-open Republican presidential field. This has made him enemies but it’s also earned him acolytes. \n ', ' ', ' Cruz has drawn large crowds at his frequent events in the early states. And he was the only top-tier candidate who was willing to go to an Iowa Agriculture Summit earlier this month sponsored by the ethanol industry and declare his unapologetic opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires that a certain percentage of gasoline come from renewable sources. \n ', ' ', ' Any realistic path to the nomination requires Cruz to win or place second in the Iowa caucuses, which has a lower turnout than a primary and thus gives more power to activists who tend to sympathize with Cruz. \n ', ' ', ' Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Iowa GOP, said Cruz’s message will appeal to a chunk of base voters and he could win if he turns out enough previous caucus-goers. \n ', ' ', ' “He doesn’t have to get creative like a Jeb Bush or Chris Christie does,” said Robinson, who is neutral. “The only problem is that you have two former caucus winners who you have to overtake: Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum.” \n ', ' ', ' Robinson said Cruz has a difficult needle to thread as he tries to appeal to a swatch of anti-establishment voters, many of whom also care deeply about backing someone who can actually win. \n ', ' ', '\n  ', ' ', ' “This ‘fighter’ brand that he embraces, while it does really appeal to activists and tea party people, it actually works against him when it comes to an electability argument,” Robinson added. “It’s not like he has ‘accomplishments’ as an elected official.” \n ', ' ', ' Cruz got a good crowd in New Hampshire the weekend before last, but he will have a harder time winning in the Granite State because independents are allowed to vote in the GOP primary. If Clinton has no credible challenger, voters from the center-left could cast ballots in the Republican contest. \n ', ' ', ' South Carolina, the first state in the South with a primary, could be friendly terrain for Cruz if he gets traction out of the first states. \n ', ' ', ' But if he were to win one of the first three states, he could be off to the races. The first day of multiple primaries, on March 1, is mostly focused on conservative Southern states where Cruz could play well and rack up a good chunk of delegates, which will be allocated proportionally. His challenge in this scenario would be to survive beyond March 15, when states are allowed to begin awarding all of their delegates to whoever wins. \n ', ' ', ' To have staying power past March 15, Cruz would need enough cash to run a national campaign. To show his fundraising prowess, Cruz will launch a 10-city fundraising tour Monday. The goal is to raise at least $1 million over the coming week and to make progress toward the campaign’s goal of raking in at least $40 million over the course of the primary campaign. \n ', ' ', ' Cruz already has assembled an inner-circle of campaign talent. Besides Miller, a South Carolina expert who helped plot Mark Sanford’s against-the-odds comeback, Cruz has longtime chief strategist Jason Johnson; Jeff Roe of Axiom Strategies, who worked for Rick Perry’s 2012 campaign and did voter identification for Huckabee in 2008; and Rick Tyler, who ran the Newt Gingrich super PAC in 2012. Chris Wilson and Chris Perkins of Wilson Perkins Allen are his pollsters. \n ', ' ', ' One big question that veteran strategists ask quietly is whether Cruz can convert large crowds that show up for his speeches into grass-roots support that will mobilize for him. He gives great stump speeches, but he can seem very introverted and disconnected one-on-one. \n ', ' ', ' The other big question after Cruz’s announcement at Liberty University is whether his play for evangelicals risks turning off some tea partyers. \n ', ' ', ' and ', ' Some key backers of Santorum and Huckabee question Cruz’s authenticity on social issues. They ask: What conservative victory has Cruz actually led on social issues? Santorum and Huckabee both can point to accomplishments and decades of being outspoken on issues like abortion. \n ', ' ', ' An Iowa Republican strategist, who is currently unaffiliated with a campaign, said it will be tough for Cruz to win the caucuses. He said it is obvious that he’s trying to put himself in the middle of the three-legged stool that Reagan used to talk about, which includes fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and national security hawks. But the strategist argued that Cruz will never be able to become “the most evangelical” candidate in the field. \n ', ' ', ' “If this is the hill he goes and dies on … that isn’t going to be fertile enough for him to win,” he said. \n ', ' ', ' Cruz aides note that he has been outspoken in his opposition to abortion and recognizing gay marriage, even as the GOP establishment has become increasingly eager to move beyond the marriage issue. He also made efforts to appeal to the religious right during his guerrilla-style 2012 Senate primary challenge to the front-runner, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. \n ', ' ', ' The speech at Liberty, the college founded by a Southern Baptist icon, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, included heavy doses of Cruz’s personal narrative, including a powerful story about his alcoholic father abandoning his family when the senator was a child but returning home after finding God. \n ', ' ', ' “I think Huckabee and Santorum will have a hard time getting votes beyond evangelicals,” said Iowa social conservative activist Sam Clovis, who backed Santorum in 2012 but is uncommitted now. “Cruz is a fresh face. In the estimate of some hard-core activists in the state, he’s been the one who has held the line the most among Republicans and has been the most visible about it.” \n ', ' ', ' “There are certainly some who would find him unelectable,” Clovis added. “I wouldn’t say most would; I would say some.” \n ', ' ', ' Recognizing this liability, Cruz tested out an uplifting message with Monday’s speech. His goal as the first candidate out of the gate is to appear as less of a shadowy figure and become more likable, endearing him to those outside his tea party base. \n ', ' ', ' “It’s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,” he said, “and I’m ready to stand with you to help lead the fight.” \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

But in a matter of weeks it’s morphed into a collection of would-be Bush rivals and detractors ganging up on the early front-runner in hopes of blunting his momentum.

Yet big donors are lining up behind him, and top political staffers are signing up for campaign jobs. He’s become the man to beat practically out of the starting block — an enviable position but one that’s put a bull’s-eye on his back. ', ' “It is hard becoming the leading candidate early because you become the target,” said John Brabender, a longtime top adviser to former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum, who waged a 2012 presidential campaign and is contemplating running again. “With success comes more scrutiny.” ', ' Bush’s team says it was only a matter of time before fire was trained on him. He wants to project an above-the-fray aura and avoid daily squabbles with opponents that make him look small, but now has to decide how or even whether to respond. ', ' “I’d rather be ahead than behind, but it does pose certain problems,” said Mac Stipanovich, a prominent Florida lobbyist and a former top Bush adviser. ', ' No one has been more aggressive in going after Bush than Paul. The day Bush announced he was pursuing a potential candidacy, the Kentucky senator began running digital ads on Google ', ' at him. After Bush came clean to using marijuana while at Phillips Academy, Paul ', ' he was being phony, pointing out that he’d refused to support legalization of the drug. “Had he been caught at Andover, he’d have never been governor, he’d probably never have a chance to run for the presidency,” Paul said. ', ' In late January, Paul pulled off an eyebrow-raising stunt, releasing a mock Bush-Clinton ', ' tweaking them for being in political dynasties and imagining them trying to work out a 2016 pact.

', ' Money is one reason opposing camps are targeting. Bush, they acknowledge, has been gaining steam in the fundraising sweepstakes, a critical component in the early primary campaign. His strength, they say, has only increased in the weeks since Mitt Romney’s exit, which freed up a pot of establishment cash to flow his way. ', ' “The attacks are in large part driven by a desire to stop any momentum and put a question in the minds of donors,” said one Paul ally. ', ' Paul’s campaign also sees an opportunity to brand Bush as a moderate — a theme it intends to hammer home in the months to come. For all Bush’s initial show of strength, Paul’s camp views him as seriously flawed and is eager to expose his liabilities. ', ' and ', ' “This primary is going to be a battle of ideas, and Gov. Bush is going to have a difficult time explaining why liberal solutions are palatable to a Republican Party hungry for something different,” said Jesse Benton, who managed Paul’s 2010 Senate campaign.

On his show Monday, Rush Limbaugh, who’s turned Bush into a favorite punching bag, ranted about “how similar” the former governor and Clinton are.

The Democratic National Committee has sketched out ', ' to paint Bush as an out-of-touch plutocrat, much as it did to Romney in 2012 with devastating effect.

During an appearance in Detroit last week, Bush lamented the rise of attack politics and said voters are hungry for something different. ', ' “I hope I have the discipline to not turn back and get into the food fights,” he said. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. ', ' “Jeb’s an adult and he will behave like one,” said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist in Florida and longtime Bush friend. “It’d be absurd and against his nature for him to get into a playground fight.” ', ' Some Bush foes, however, think another motivation is at work. With so many candidates in the race, an ally of one Bush opponent argued, the Florida Republican was looking for an opportunity to separate himself from the rest of the field — something the attacks may be helping him achieve. ', ' Others, however, think Bush will ultimately need to defend his conservative credentials to prevail in early primary states where tea party voters are a powerful faction. ', ' “With Romney out, Jeb has obviously become the leading establishment candidate. And by being the leading establishment candidate, he’s positioned for money and support,” Brabender said. “But it doesn’t come with the same positioning it used to, because we’re more of a rebellion-based party.” ', ' Democrats are watching closely to see how Bush, who departed the governor’s mansion eight years ago, handles himself in the coming weeks. The offensive against him, they believe, amounts to a critical early test of his political skills.

VOGEL', '\n                Photo Illustration/Getty Images', 'A few hours after a certain former Florida governor took to Facebook last month to announce he was going to “ ', ', a political action committee called the Conservative Action Fund blasted out an email to thousands of recipients urging them to “ ', '.” ', ' The email, signed by the PAC’s chairman, Shaun McCutcheon, pleaded, “If you are a conservative like me who is tired of the special interest, political elites like Jeb Bush running the GOP, then I need your immediate help to make it clear that American conservatives reject a Jeb Bush candidacy.” ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Bush could be persuaded to stay out of the race, McCutcheon’s email asserted, if “hundreds of thousands of conservative, grassroots activists” signed petitions by Dec. 19 to be “hand delivered to Jeb Bush in a very public way” that would presumably shame him out of the race. “And after you sign the petition, please make a donation of $5, $15, $25 or more to help us get even more signatures?” the email concluded in underlined bold text embedded with a hyperlink that took readers to a petition landing page that ', ' and then ', '. ', ' It was a slick and well-timed campaign, tapping into the angst of grass-roots conservatives who are as unhappy with GOP leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House John Boehner as they are with President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats. ', ' And while the PAC’s treasurer told POLITICO that the email got an “extremely positive” response in petition signatures and contributions, more than one month later the Conservative Action Fund had yet to deliver any signed petitions to Bush. It did, however, send out a similar email this month urging recipients to sign a petition to “ ', '” and then to make a contribution of “at least $17.76 today” to “help keep our efforts funded.” ', ' The efforts bear some of the hallmarks of a phenomenon that watchdogs say is threatening the integrity of the campaign funding system, and that conservative leaders worry could seriously undermine their interests headed into 2016. Since the tea party ', ' in 2009, the conservative movement has been plagued by an explosion of PACs that critics say exist mostly to pad the pockets of the consultants who run them. Combining sophisticated targeting techniques with fundraising appeals that resonate deeply among grass-roots activists, they collect large piles of small checks that, taken together, add up to enough money to potentially sway a Senate race. But the PACs plow most of their cash back into payments to consulting firms for additional fundraising efforts. ', ' A POLITICO analysis of reports filed with the Federal Election Commission covering the 2014 cycle found that 33 PACs that court small donors with tea party-oriented email and direct-mail appeals raised $43 million — 74 percent of which came from small donors. The PACs spent only $3 million on ads and contributions to boost the long-shot candidates often touted in the appeals, compared to $39.5 million on operating expenses, including $6 million to firms owned or managed by the operatives who run the PACs. POLITICO’s list is not all-inclusive, and some conservatives fret that it’s almost impossible to identify all the groups that are out there, let alone to rein them in. ', ' “These groups have the pulse of the crowd, and they recognize that they can make a profit off the angst of the conservative base voters who are looking for outsiders,” said the ', ' Erick Erickson, who has taken it upon himself to call out PAC operators and fundraisers he sees as scams. They are “completely a drain,” said Erickson, whose assessments of candidates and groups carry particular weight among tea party activists and the ', '. “The conservative activists feel like they’ve contributed to a cause greater than themselves, but the money goes to the consultants, and eventually the activists get burned out and stop giving money, including to the legitimate causes.” ', ' In the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections, McConnell and Boehner tried to ', ', and McConnell’s allies last week ', ' ', ' to go along with one that Boehner’s confidants ', ', partly to stem the flow of cash to competing PACs.

That ', ' if the 2016 Democratic presidential primary inflames deep ideological divisions within the party. ', ' But on the right, ', ' appears only to be growing, according to conservatives who track it closely. ', ' A couple of days after receiving the anti-Bush email from the Conservative Action Fund, Erickson ', ' to lament the trend. “It is a terrible blight on the conservative movement and on the tea party in particular that the hucksters have come up to cash in,” he wrote. “From the groups claiming to represent Ben Carson to the groups raising money for Allen West to now a group claiming to raise money to ‘Stop Jeb Bush,’ I think more and more older conservatives are getting scammed by con men living well off other people’s money. I doubt very much that much, if any, of the money is going to support these causes.” ', ' Such efforts could be particularly damaging to Republican chances in 2016. In recent elections, the party’s nominees have sometimes ', ' necessary to ', ', particularly at the presidential level, where presumptive nominees can face a funding gap in the ', ' after they’ve tapped all their major donors for the primary but before they’re legally allowed to start spending a second round of big checks for the general election. ', ' PACs like those that have drawn Erickson’s scorn don’t have to slog through a long campaign with repetitive fundraising appeals. They can, and do, quickly change focus to keep pace with the scandal of the moment — from ', ' to Obamacare to liberal media bias to Islamic extremism. Old PACs associated with stale issues or politicians are shuttered, and new ones created to fill the void. ', ' Among the more consistent themes of the PACs — much to the dismay of the GOP establishment — is the targeting of RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) and the boosting of ideologically pure Republican candidates, including many who stand little chance of winning. A particular focus is on politicians who are military veterans, tea party activists, African-Americans — or all three. ', ' have swirled around PACs and operatives who have claimed to be supporting African-American conservatives, including former Rep. Allen West, 2012 ', ', fringe ', ' and two-time unsuccessful House candidate ', ' of Georgia. And a PAC called the Black Republican PAC spent less than 1 percent of the $700,000 it raised in 2014 on contributions to candidates or ads supporting them, according to government filings. ', ' While operating expenses sometimes include travel or salaries for staff involved in get-out-the-vote or other political activities, most of the groups POLITICO examined do very little on-the-ground work, instead spending the majority of their cash on fundraising such as renting and soliciting from direct-mail and email lists. But defenders of the PACs contend that their fundraising efforts perform a valuable service for the conservative movement by mobilizing the grass-roots base, and that it costs money to raise money. ', ' “Direct mail is expensive. Phone campaigns are expensive,” said Dan Backer, who serves as a lawyer, treasurer and strategist for the Conservative Action Fund and 14 other PACs included in POLITICO’s analysis. “Email is not as free as people want to pretend like it is. It’s really expensive. … And there’s a lot of money that goes into making these things legal so — I hate to say it — you pay for lawyers,” he added. ', ' In 2014, Backer’s PACs — a roster including Draft Newt (created to coax the former House speaker ', '), the Tea Party Leadership Fund (which ', ' for Senate), Stop Hillary (to ', '’s expected presidential campaign) and Stop Pelosi (which the Federal Election Commission ', ' for using the House Democratic leader’s name) — spent more than 87 percent of the $8 million they raised on operating expenses, including $419,000 to Backer’s own law firm, DB Capitol Strategies. By contrast, the amount the PACs spent on donations and ads was about $955,000 — or less than 12 percent of their total fundraising haul. ', ' McCutcheon, the Alabama electrical contractor who chairs the Conservative Action Fund and signed the “Stop Jeb Bush” email, said Backer provides a valuable service to PACs. “It’s up to donors like me to decide if we want to buy, and, in my case, I did. I wanted to buy a lot,” said McCutcheon, who was among the top donors to Backer-linked PACs during the midterms, giving at least $34,000. “If anybody was getting scammed, it would be me. I’m one of the biggest donors to all of these things out there and will continue to donate,” he said, though he conceded there are unsavory PAC operators. “It’s just like in business. Anytime there’s money out there, there’s going to be some of them that are not legitimate.” ', ' In an interview last month in Backer’s office in a third-floor walk-up over an architectural ceramics shop in the ', ' of Old Town in Alexandria, Virginia, Backer explained that his PACs have to spend more on fundraising because they’re mostly new and are trying to build supporter bases from scratch. ', ' But he bristled at efforts by fellow conservatives to cast his efforts as profiteering. “It drives me nuts when people say ‘Oh, scam PAC this, scam PAC that,’” he said. Singling out Erickson in particular, Backer pointed out that the pundit’s own email list is routinely rented for fundraising by PACs, including some represented by Backer. (Erickson said he has no control over ', ' by the company that owns it, “and it horrifies me that the list sometimes get rented to some of these guys.”) ', ' Backer, a jovial and fast-talking 37-year-old father of two young sons, got into the business in 2009, just as the tea party was ', '. He started DB Capitol Strategies in 2010, not long after graduating from George Mason University School of Law, after a three-month stint working for a firm defending people against mortgage foreclosure, some of whom he said “probably knew exactly what they were doing and really deserved to be foreclosed upon.” By contrast, he considers tea party PACs both a viable business proposition and a cause he can get behind. ', ' “These guys need legal help, and they need to be able to afford that legal help — they don’t have big money — and so there’s not a market big enough there to justify a lot of lawyers practicing in that space,” he said. “So I kind of found a niche that I work to, but also very much is my philosophy.” ', ' When POLITICO presented Backer with a printout listing all 40 committees he’d registered in the past five years, he said “Man, there’s a lot of dead PACs on here,” and began crossing off terminated entities, including a super PAC created to draft Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano for president. It spent more than half the $11,000 it raised during the 2014 cycle on payments to Backer’s firm. ', ' “I would love to do a draft presidential committee for all the guys who I think have something serious or good to say,” said Backer, who, unlike more traditional election lawyers, gets involved in his PAC’s fundraising and messaging.

0,What Trump bump?,"['\n                        ', '\n                        Republican operatives insist Donald Trump’s surge in the polls is just a mirage.', '\n                    By ', 'Judging from a spate of recent polls, Donald Trump is riding a wave of popular support. But if you ask Republican campaign pollsters and other political consultants, it’s just a mirage, nothing more than a reflection of faulty public polling about how actual Republican primary voters feel about Trump and the other candidates. ', ' “Such junk,” ', ' B.J. Martino, a pollster on Scott Walker’s presidential campaign, responding to ', ' in Iowa and New Hampshire, two of three surveys released Sunday that showed Trump at or near the top of the pack. The polls showed Trump leading in New Hampshire and running neck-and-neck with Walker in Iowa, where the Wisconsin governor has been the early favorite. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The problem, Republican political professionals say, is that Trump’s rise to the top has been driven by intense media coverage of his often circus-like campaign. That media attention, some Republicans gripe, causes his poll numbers to rise — which, in turn, leads to more media attention. ', ' But polling methodology, these critics argue, is also skewing the numbers. Public surveys are often conducted by random-digit dialing: randomly generating and dialing telephone numbers on both landlines and cell phones. Private polls, like the ones conducted for political campaigns, start with lists of voters. While the respondents are still randomly selected from this pool, using voter-registration data allows pollsters to impose other controls on the sample, such as calling only those with a history of voting in lower-turnout elections, like primaries or off-year races. ', ' That, campaign pollsters say, screens out people who would say they are going to vote but are less likely to cast ballots. The public polls, on the other hand, include those voters. ', ' There are other key differences between the media and private polls. The national public polling in the Republican primary includes all those who self-identify as registered Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the rules for who gets to vote in primaries differ from state to state: some states have primaries that are closed to voters who aren’t registered with the party, such as Florida. Others, like New Hampshire and South Carolina, allow independents to vote in one party’s primary election. (And some other states, like Virginia, don’t have party registration at all.) ', ' In recent national polls, Trump performs as well or better among self-identified Republican-leaning independents — the kind of voters who might be overrepresented in public polls — than those who identify as committed Republicans. That’s why GOP campaign professionals are telling anyone who will listen that the polls are overestimating Trump’s appeal among the small group of voters who will eventually participate in the party’s nominating process. ', ' “Iowa Republican caucus goers are roughly 10% of registered voters in the state,” Martino said in a follow-up ', '. “NBC/Marist’s poll? 37% of registered voters.” ', ' With national polling serving as the most important part of the criteria for participation in the first two televised GOP debates, the methodology issue is suddenly front and center. Fox News Channel, which is hosting the first debate next week, has said only the top 10 candidates in an average of national public polls will be invited. ', ' “Normally these polls would be great entertainment value,” said Patrick Ruffini, the co-founder of Echelon Insights, a GOP analytics firm. “The problem is we’re using this to determine who gets into the debates.” ', ' Media pollsters defend their work. Random-digit dialing is the best way to achieve a true random sample, they say, and it’s too early for the horse-race numbers to be predictive of the election result. ', ' The GOP primary match-ups in the NBC News/Marist polls, for example, included voters who said they were registered Republicans and independents who said they preferred to vote in the GOP caucus or primary. Neither voters’ past turnout performance nor their stated likelihood to vote this time was used to screen out those who were unlikely to vote. ', ' “What we are doing is we are adhering to the laws in each of the states,” said Barbara Carvalho, the director of the Marist poll. “Our criteria are based on who potentially may participate in each of the states.” ', ' But, to some GOP campaign professionals, that’s far too inclusive. ', ' “You have an Iowa poll in which 37 percent of the people get screened in as potential caucusgoers,” said Ruffini, referring to the NBC News/Marist poll. ', ' Fewer than 6 percent of registered voters attended the 2012 Iowa GOP caucusgoers, Ruffini wrote in a detailed ', ' of public polling in a post on the website Medium. “This year, the effect of including low-propensity voters in primary polls may be especially great because of a certain mega-celebrity who starts with near total name recognition: Donald Trump,” he wrote. ', ' Sunday wasn’t the first instance of Republican criticism of the public 2016 presidential polling. POLITICO reported earlier this month that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s pollster, Chris Wilson, sent a letter to a number of other campaigns asking them to join him in proposing strict standards for Fox News to use in selecting the polls that would comprise the debate average. Those recommendations included sample sizes of at least 1,000 voters and including only those voters who say they intend to cast ballots in their state’s nominating contest. ', ' None of the public polls have come close to meeting those criteria. Of the last five public polls conducted by live interviewers — Fox News’ apparent standard for inclusion — no poll surveyed more than 419 Republican voters. ', ' That’s because the Republican primary is being tacked onto surveys of all Americans, which ask about the presidential race, among other issues. When a campaign is polling for a specific election, they sample voters specifically for that race. ', ' “They’re trying to do both the primary and the general election,” Ruffini said. “And you can’t really do both well in a single survey. The reality is that maybe 10 percent of the voting-age population will end up voting in the Republican primary.” ', ' For years, public pollsters have urged observers to look beyond the horse-race numbers in their poll — arguing that the purpose of the survey isn’t to predict the election, but to shed light on what voters think and what’s driving their decisions. That’s one reason some pollsters are lamenting the role that has been thrust upon them by news organizations that are using polling performance to whittle down the GOP debate field. ', ' “We’re supposed to be measuring that which is occurring,” said Marist Institute for Public Opinion director Lee Miringoff. “By making the poll numbers determine eligibility to get into the debate, the polls are actually shaping candidate behavior. They are just trying to create a surge to get into the debate. That’s not just putting the cart before the horse. That’s putting the cart before the cart.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Jeb Bush, who remains popular with that state’s large Latino population. “Romney could very well pay an even higher price with Latinos, but it will be for things he’s said and done. The tragic part about it is that he’s done it to win over the very conservatives, and they still [aren’t supporting him].” ', ' One top GOP operative said that number needs to be closer to 33 percent: “We lose Hispanics this bad, we lose the whole election. Period.” ', ' That opinion is growing. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn (R-Texas) and other top party brass have made it known to Romney’s campaign that the party risks losing Hispanic voters by a historic margin, creating a downward draft on Senate and House candidates, according to two Hill sources.

You made me the man I am today.” \n ', ' ', ' Graham’s team sees the story as a way to make him more relatable, an important goal for a long-shot contender pulling in less than 2 percent in the polls. His announcement comes as even some allies question why he’s running in the crowded GOP field instead of focusing on the Senate, where he enjoys a position of significant influence. \n ', ' ', ' So it was no accident that Graham chose to show off his up-by-the-bootstraps story on Monday in this sleepy speck of a town located about 45 minutes from Greenville, where Main Street consists of a thrift shop, a hair salon and a restaurant or two — including the remnants of the Graham family’s bar. \n ', ' ', ' Graham’s sister, Darline Graham Nordone, spoke proudly of her brother and late parents during a brief interview Sunday night before Graham’s walk-through. \n ', ' ', ' “Our parents were small-business owners here in the town of Central,” she said. “As any other small-business owners, they understood the long hard hours that go into running a small business, and just the strong work ethic that we got from that and the values … It’s just amazing that we come from this and went on to bigger and better things, but our roots are here.” \n ', ' ', ' She also introduced her brother Monday, her voice breaking at times as she described how Graham, as a college student, would come home every weekend to “check on his little sister” instead of staying on campus like most other students did. \n ', ' ', ' The humble-origins narrative is a staple of presidential campaigning, but it’s a fairly new device for Graham, who has started to employ it only in recent years — and it still doesn’t animate him on the stump anywhere near as much as discussing foreign policy and national security does. It wasn’t until his 2014 Senate race, when he squared off with six primary challengers, that he slowly and sometimes reluctantly began to use that part of his biography in part to fight back against criticism that he had been in Washington too long. \n ', ' ', ' “Some of you have known me since my family lived in the back of that bar, in that building,” he said on Monday, gesturing to the place he grew up from a podium several feet away. “I’m pretty sure no one here, including me, ever expected to hear me say, ‘I’m Lindsey Graham and I’m running for president of the United States.” \n ', ' ', ' But both the candidate and the crowd were at their loudest and most enthusiastic when Graham, one of the country’s most vocal hawks, talked about national security. \n ', ' ', ' “[To] those who believe we can disengage from the world at large and be safe from leading from behind: Vote for someone else. I am not your man,” he said, an apparent jab at Republican rival Rand Paul, who in Washington over the weekend helped temporarily derail the reauthorization of elements of the PATRIOT Act over concerns about civil liberties. “Those who believe that the best way to defend ourselves is by leading the world and making history instead of being overwhelmed by it, I ask for your support.” \n ', ' ', ' The announcement, which filled up about a block of the town, drew several hundred people, some of whom were wearing veterans’ hats. The crowd often burst into cheers of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” and the event felt at times more like a conversational Senate campaign rally than a grand-scale presidential launch, though Graham threw in a few 2016-related digs. \n ', ' ', ' “I’ve got one simple message,” he said. “I have more experience with our national security than any other candidate in this race. That includes you, Hillary.” \n ', ' ', ' But some allies of Graham are glad he’s trying to highlight his personal story instead of focusing singularly on foreign policy. \n ', ' ', ' “I think it’s a good idea for people to realize, he’s certainly a self-educated, self-made guy,” said Hank Scott, a major donor who is very close to Graham. “He worked hard to get where he is, he’s not a person that grew up with privilege, like, say, [Jeb] Bush.” \n ', ' ', ' David Woodard, an operative and professor who managed Graham’s first two House races in the 1990s, said he never heard Graham talk about his family’s troubles at the time, even when those issues were fresher for him. \n ', ' ', ' “Did he talk about it? No, he never talked about it,” Woodard said, adding later, “He’s kind of a self-made story, but he didn’t talk about it.” \n ', ' ', ' During his reelection last year, after some reluctance about getting too personal, Graham allowed his team to run an ad featuring his sister, Darline, who grew emotional in the ', ' when she reflected on how Graham helped raise her. \n ', ' ', ' “It was hard when we lost my mom and my dad,” she said in the ad. “Lindsey assured me that he was going to take care of me, he was going to be there for me. He never let me down. Never. I don’t see how he did it, to take on the responsibility of raising a little sister. That came from within for Lindsey.” \n ', ' ', ' Graham won that race just as he’s won every congressional contest in which he’s run, starting in 1994, many of them with the help of South Carolina’s top political talent. Yet as he begins his run for president, many of them are not on board. When he indicated he was serious about running for president, many of the state’s most well-respected operatives were caught off guard — and had already agreed to help other candidates. \n ', ' ', ' “I’ve been involved in all of his Senate campaigns, and it was tough, but my ship has sailed,” said J. Warren Tompkins, a veteran South Carolina operative who is committed to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. “I had committed long before I had any inkling he had any interest in running for president.” \n ', ' ', ' In some state political circles, even where Graham is popular, there’s a sense of bewilderment about why he’s running — and some donors and operatives say privately that they wish he’d stick to the Senate. In a very crowded Republican field, Graham barely registers in the national polls; he has low name identification and his record on issues like immigration reform is still anathema to the grass-roots conservative voters who are so critical in early voting states like Iowa. \n ', ' ', ' “I’ll always be supporting Lindsey any and every way I can,” said Scott, the donor, whose own divided loyalty is revealing — he says he’s supporting both his friend and Rubio. Noting how crowded the field is, “I tried to encourage him to play the Strom Thurmond role and stay in the Senate,” Scott added. \n ', ' ', ' It’s unclear how well Graham is polling in South Carolina presidential surveys — an NBC News poll from February ', ' him leading the pack but an April poll from local Winthrop University ', 'that more than half of his home-state GOP voters would not considering voting for him for the nomination. \n ', ' ', ' His South Carolina political colleagues aren’t lined up behind him either: Several of the state’s House members appeared at a presidential launch event for Sen. Paul — Graham’s nemesis on foreign policy matters — though they ', ' of endorsing. And Gov. Nikki Haley, who has said she won’t endorse early, offered a lukewarm response to Graham’s announcement. \n ', ' ', ' “South Carolina voters are an independent bunch – some will support Sen. Graham, and some will not,” she wrote on Facebook, as she also said the state should be proud he’s running. “But regardless of where our support goes, Lindsey Graham has earned our gratitude and our good wishes as he begins his campaign today.” \n ', ' ', ' Graham’s supporters believe he will play a key role in pushing national security issues to the forefront, and that the senator — who at Republican cattle calls so far this year has impressed with his sense of humor and command of foreign policy — will expand his base as more people get to know him. \n ', ' ', ' He’s a natural, folksy campaigner and his hawkish foreign policy message plays well with a Republican base that’s grown increasingly anxious about instability in the Middle East and the rise of the Islamic State. In his address, he offered red meat to the GOP base by railing against “radical Islam,” which in his estimation, is “running wild.” \n ', ' ', ' He promised to “make them small, poor and on the run. I’m afraid some Americans have grown tired of fighting them. I have bad news to share with you: the radical Islamists are not tired of fighting you.” \n ', ' ', ' “I want to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill us. Not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them!” he pledged at another point. \n ', ' ', ' Despite the seemingly impossible path to the GOP nomination, Graham’s allies insist he is seriously interested in pursuing a White House bid and wouldn’t run if he didn’t see a path to victory, even as speculation abounds in South Carolina about whether he’s positioning for another job, like secretary of defense, or to be a kingmaker during the first-in-the-South South Carolina primary. \n ', ' ', ' In the meantime, a super PAC supporting Graham, Security is Strength, is also gearing up and announced its staff over the weekend. It is largely driven by former Graham campaign and Senate staffers, and also includes former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman. Graham is a favorite of hawkish donors — megadonor Sheldon Adelson co-hosted a ', ' on Capitol Hill for him several months ago, and plenty of people aligned with other candidates showed up and even served on the host committee. \n ', ' ', ' For Graham, the uphill climb ahead was obvious on Sunday night before his announcement: A handful of interested bystanders who appeared in Central before Graham’s walk-through said they supported him in his Senate bid — but none was ready to commit to him for president yet. \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

But people close to Clinton told POLITICO this week that she won’t weigh in on the project anytime soon, saying it would be inappropriate for her to appear to push either Obama or Secretary of State John Kerry on an issue that’s still under review.

Burress said he gave the young lawyer one of his early jobs.

0,Rubio: I'm ready to become commander in chief,"['\n                    By ', ' and KATIE GLUECK', '\n                    Updated ', 'In a Wednesday foreign policy address, Marco Rubio staked a claim to being the Republican presidential field’s toughest — and most qualified — candidate on national security, capping a four-year effort to cultivate expertise in an area of top concern for GOP voters. ', ' In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Rubio alleged that President Barack Obama has flinched from a dangerous world and argued for “American strength [as] a means of preventing war, not promoting it.” ', 'Story Continued Below', ' But he also said that, given the benefit of hindsight about flawed intelligence, he would not have supported invading Iraq in 2003. (“Not only would I not have been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it,” Rubio said.) That set up a contrast with Jeb Bush, who equivocated on the question this week. ', ' Rubio’s Iraq comments followed a 20-minute address designed to showcase his credentials as a foreign policy savant, an image he has cultivated since his arrival in Washington just over four years ago. Rubio came to the Senate from the Florida Legislature with no national security experience beyond a keen interest in Cuba and a boyhood fascination with the military. ', ' Since then, he has worked assiduously to build his national security credentials and expertise, particularly after a foray into immigration reform became a political quagmire. Aides believe that none of his Republican rivals can match his foreign policy savvy, a point implicit in his willingness to field unscripted questions from CFR members after his speech. ', ' “I actually traveled to Libya after the fall of Gadhafi,” Rubio said casually in response to one questioner. That is a preview of things to come on the campaign trail, where Rubio is sure to draw from overseas trips, classified briefings and meetings with foreign leaders unavailable to most of his GOP rivals. ', ' Rubio’s critics scoff at his claim to be a foreign policy heavyweight, noting that Obama was also a first-term senator who came from a state legislature. Supporters of his rivals in statehouses say that executive experience is more important in the Oval Office than knowing the difference between Dubai and Doha. Rubio insists he is more qualified than Obama was when he first ran, a claim the website PolitiFact recently ', ' “half true.” ', ' The political stakes are high. Polls show that national security has soared to the top of the list of issues that concern Republican primary voters. A February Pew poll found that voters trust Republicans over Democrats on foreign policy by a margin of 13 points — the first time in the Obama era that Pew found a GOP advantage on the issue. ', ' For now, Rubio appears to be chasing conservative primary voters — and big-money donors — with increasingly hawkish rhetoric. On Wednesday, he stressed the need for a more robust defense budget and said Obama’s hoped-for nuclear deal with Iran would make war “even more likely.” ', ' A few days earlier, Rubio explained his policy toward terrorists by quoting Liam Neeson’s character from the 2008 thriller “Taken”: “‘We will look for you, we will find you, and we will kill you.” ', ' Behind the sound bites, Rubio’s supporters say, is a nuanced understanding of the world developed through focused hard work — and boyhood dreams. In his 2012 memoir, Rubio writes that his Cuban émigré grandfather taught him about the importance of American power against fascism and communism. The young Rubio once aspired to lead an exile army to overthrow Fidel Castro and “become president of a free Cuba.” In fifth grade, Rubio wrote a paper hailing Ronald Reagan’s military budget. ', ' After arriving in Washington, Rubio followed more adult pursuits — grabbing seats on the Senate’s foreign relations and intelligence committees. The latter assignment gave him access to classified briefings on issues like terrorism, electronic surveillance and Iran’s nuclear program. “I’m privy to the most sensitive information available to the U.S. government,” Rubio told The Des Moines Register last month. ', ' He has also racked up more frequent-flier miles than most of rivals and many Senate colleagues, traveling to 15 countries over the past four years. ', ' During a February 2013 trip to the Middle East, soon after he delivered the GOP response to Obama’s State of the Union speech, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who toasted Rubio with a water bottle, in a joking nod to Rubio’s famously awkward sip of water during a national TV appearance days earlier. ', ' Rubio had an unlikely adviser early on: John Kerry. Then the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry advised his younger colleague that his public profile was sufficiently high — Rubio appeared on the cover of Time magazine in February 2013 as “The Republican Savior” — that he no longer needed to join crowded congressional delegations abroad. Kerry said that Rubio could secure solo meetings with top foreign leaders, unlike many of his colleagues, and should take advantage of the ability to travel on his own. ', ' Rubio took the advice, taking solo trips in 2012 and 2013 to destinations including Haiti, Colombia and Japan, meeting heads of state in each. ', ' Since 2013, a far more substantive adviser has been Jamie Fly, a former nonproliferation aide in George W. Bush’s White House and Pentagon with strong ties to the party’s neoconservative wing. Before joining Rubio’s staff, Fly had been executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a think tank whose founders include the prominent conservative hawks Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan. ', ' Rubio’s office won’t divulge the names of other outside advisers, although aides have said in the past that he has consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Bush White House national security aide and Middle East expert Elliott Abrams. ', ' On Wednesday, Rubio concluded his speech with the suggestion that — unlike rivals furiously boning up on world events — he needs no further training. ', ' “The first duty of the president, as written in the Constitution, is not ‘taxer in chief’ or ‘regulator in chief’ — it is commander in chief,” Rubio said. “Every presidential candidate must be prepared to execute this duty.” ', ' Left implicit was his view that not all of them are.

', ' By all measures, the 59-year-old Graham is a long shot in the race. He’s not a household name like Jeb Bush. He lacks the executive experience of Scott Walker. And he doesn’t have the bona fides with the conservative base and talk radio that Cruz has. ', ' Polling shows Graham at rock bottom among all the potential contenders in a very crowded field. ', ' Graham, who has served in Congress since 1995 and is an attorney in the Air Force Reserve, is not without a wide range of votes that add to his baggage headed into 2016. He voted for both of President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominees. He backs Loretta Lynch to be attorney general. He believes climate change is real and that the federal government should do something about it. He’s open to a Simpson-Bowles-type approach to rein in big deficits, something that would raise tax revenues. And he was an architect of the comprehensive immigration bill, something the right wing of his party despises. ', ' Graham is not a candidate yet, but he is increasingly sounding like one. He’s traveled to early states like Iowa and New Hampshire, showing a penchant for lacing barbs and self-deprecating humor into a fiery stump speech — a campaigning style he polished during three successful Senate runs in South Carolina. He’s set up an exploratory committee called Security Through Strength, and the senator is now leaning toward launching a run this spring. ', ' Graham says he will address his skeptics head-on, aggressively explaining his arguments that a president deserves to have well-qualified nominees; that both sides need to give a little to put the country on a sound fiscal path; and that a major immigration bill is the way to deal with the range of problems to fix a broken visa system and lax security at the borders. Overall, the message he plans to espouse: It’s better to have a president who is pragmatic than an ideological hard-liner. ', ' “This campaign will be focused on a heavy dose of realism — surrounded by optimism if we make the right policy choices,” Graham said. “It’s about what I think is possible in terms of the current political construct and how to grow conservatism. But at the end of the day, it will be focused on problem-solving, which will require a certain level of realism and bipartisanship.” ', ' If I run, we’re going to have a debate about what’s real and what’s not. ', ' “If I run, we’re going to have a debate about what’s real and what’s not,” Graham added. ', ' Graham would be a factor if only for the basic fact that he hails from South Carolina, which hosts the first presidential primary in the South in 2016. If he makes enough headway in one of the first two states — more likely New Hampshire than Iowa — Graham and his team believe he can pull off a win in his backyard of South Carolina. ', ' Graham and Cruz get along well. They traded jokes sitting side-by-side at the State of the Union speech in 2014. And when the Texas Republican visited Charleston last April, Graham lavished his colleague with praise, noting in particular foreign policy views that align with his own. ', ' Yet the two men represent the opposite wings of the party, which have frequently sparred since Obama took office: The no-compromise, tea party conservatives who believe Republicans need to return to their roots vs. the deal-making Republicans who argue that the GOP needs to be pragmatic in order to govern in a divided Washington. ', ' That debate is bound to get more pronounced as campaign season takes shape. ', ' “He realizes in the legislative branch, compromise is a principle you can’t do without,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the president pro tempore, referring to Graham. “That’s a very important thing where some of the others may not have that same attitude.” ', ' In some ways, Graham is mimicking the style of his closest friend in the Senate, John McCain. The Arizona Republican won the GOP nomination in 2008 on his “Straight Talk Express,” pushing an aggressive foreign policy view that he used as a cudgel against primary foes, like Mitt Romney, who lacked experience on the global stage. Similarly, with foreign policy emerging in 2016 as a top-tier issue — stemming from growing concerns surrounding the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Iran and Russia — a candidate with a history of espousing hard-line national security views could penetrate among the GOP electorate, Graham’s allies say. ', ' But the comparisons to McCain cut both ways. ', ' Cruz, for one, points to the likes of McCain and Romney in arguing that Republican voters can no longer afford to nominate candidates who are part of the “mushy middle” and lose general elections by moving to the left. Instead, he argues, Republicans need to choose the boldest and most “courageous” conservative who will not yield from the party’s bedrock principles. ', ' “Instead of a Tax Code that crushes innovation, that imposes burdens on families struggling to make ends meet, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard,” Cruz told supporters as he launched his candidacy on Monday. “Imagine abolishing the IRS!” ', ' “Imagine in 2017 a new president, signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,” Cruz said to roaring applause, promising also to kill the Common Core educational program. ', ' Asked about those promises Tuesday, Graham was blunt. ', ' “You’re not going to do that,” he said. Instead, Graham explained his desire in particular to keep Obamacare provisions that prevent insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing illnesses and ensuring children can stay on their parents’ policies until the age of 26. “So there are parts of this bill that we would adopt.” ', ' As for the flat tax, Graham said: “We can flatten out the Tax Code. That’s what Simpson-Bowles did. But we aren’t going to abolish the IRS.” ', ' Similarly, Graham said he would talk at length about overhauling long-term “unfunded liabilities,” namely Medicare — the third rail of politics. And speaking to GOP audiences, he plans to make the case that “rational immigration reform” is needed “because we don’t have enough native-born workers.” ', ' “I’m trying to lay a realistic picture of the national security and economic threats we face and the solutions that I think are achievable.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

The state’s U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor and his Republican challenger, U.S. Rep.

They also have plans to launch direct mail and radio and TV ads as Election Day nears. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The decision by leading Washington advocacy groups not to urge their large voting bloc to stay at home in November confirms the political calculation of senior Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House: Latino voters won’t abandon the party, even with a delay on executive action. Latino leaders believe that electing more Republicans to Congress weakens the chances of any immigration reform legislation passing and that picking a fight with Obama — their most powerful ally — could backfire. \n ', ' ', ' “We just can’t sit back and dwell on this. We’ve got to get out and work and build our own political power,” said Latino Victory Project’s Cristóbal Alex, who predicted that more than 7 million Latino voters would turn out for the midterm elections. \n ', ' ', ' The White House also played a role in quelling some anger by holding a series of meetings with stakeholders since the announcement that Obama would not move forward before the election. \n ', ' ', ' But it remains unclear, even to groups spending millions of dollars on Election Day efforts, whether Hispanics will respond to the call. Obama’s decision to postpone an executive order until the end of the year has made the job of driving up interest among Latino voters — already a challenge in midterm election years — much more difficult, according to activists and political analysts. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' One topic they aren’t using widely to turn out the voters in the midterms: immigration reform. Instead, the drive is focused on motivating Latino voters over issues like education, health care, the economy and the environment. \n ', ' ', ' So far, there are 100 partners in the Hispanic Heritage Month get-out-the-vote movement, which has registered more than 38,000 people online. The effort has more voter registration events planned next week in Texas, Florida and Utah and is also engaging through Twitter. \n ', ' ', ' If Latino voters show up on Election Day, they could prove decisive in close Senate, House and gubernatorial races, according to an analysis from the polling firm Latino Decisions. \n ', ' ', ' The clearest example is the Senate contest in Colorado, where 14 percent of eligible registered voters are Hispanic. But Latino Decisions has also identified the Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia Senate races as campaigns where Latino voting rates could swing the election. Even in Kansas, where Latinos make up 5.5 percent of registered voters, Hispanic turnout could swing the election if candidates target them, Matt Barreto, co-founder of polling firm Latino Decisions, said. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The top-tier gubernatorial races for Latino influence include Illinois, Florida, Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Texas, according to the firm. \n ', ' ', ' If these elections come down to the margins, the growing Hispanic electorate in each state could decide the outcome, Barreto said at a briefing hosted by the National Council of La Raza on the midterm elections. \n ', ' ', ' Not that they’re optimistic. \n ', ' ', ' “The advocacy organizations want people to vote, and I want people to vote, but if you’re a Latino in North Carolina, and the president delayed his decision to help Kay Hagan in her election, why would you go vote for Kay Hagan?” said Gary Segura, a Latino Decisions co-founder. \n ', ' ', ' Asked by a reporter whether he was advocating that Latinos stay home in November, Segura said he was speaking as an analyst. But it prompted a quick retort from Janet Murguía, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza. \n ', ' ', ' “The NCLR is not encouraging anyone to sit on the sidelines,” she said. \n ', ' ', ' A June poll conducted by Latino Decisions with the Center for American Progress found that 57 percent of Latinos said Obama’s failure to take executive action would leave them less enthusiastic about voting Democratic and 54 percent said they would be less excited to vote at all. \n ', ' ', ' Latino outside groups are aware of the need to try to energize their base, so they expect to push ahead. \n ', ' ', ' Next week several groups, including the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, will be in Arizona to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first statewide anti-immigration proposition in California, which spurred Latino and immigrant participation in the election process. \n ', ' ', ' The drive to raise cash has also continued.

0,"Emanuel: D.C. hero, Chicago goat","['\n                 Just nine months out from the next election, Emanuel is unexpectedly vulnerable.', '\n                    By MAGGIE HABERMAN', 'CHICAGO — In Washington, he is “Rahmbo,” the ruthless, profane operative who survived the Clinton White House despite being vanquished by the first lady. In Chicago, Rahm Emanuel has been dubbed the “murder mayor” by one critic, a snipe at the city’s high homicide rate. ', ' \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' In Washington, he’s the campaign mastermind who reportedly mused about a 2016 presidential run if Hillary Clinton takes a pass. In Chicago, he’s the ham-fisted gentrifer who’s been tripped up by the city’s entrenched racial politics. \n ', ' ', ' In Washington, he’s the star of the CNN series “Chicagoland” — a careful keeper of his image whose office helped coordinate the show. In the real Chicago, a city known for its mobster history, his tough-guy veneer just isn’t as intimidating. ', ' \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' When Emanuel exited the Beltway in late 2010 to run for Chicago mayor, he had the tacit backing of a current president and the overt support of a former one. He won the race to succeed Richard M. Daley, and expectations ran high that Washington’s supreme enforcer was just the person to tame the Wild Midwest. \n ', ' ', ' Now, just nine months out from the next election, Emanuel is unexpectedly vulnerable, with an approval rating that is perilously low. The comedown for the Illinois native, who terrified staffers and donors over more than a decade in Washington, has been striking. So has been the contrast between how he’s regarded in D.C., New York and Los Angeles — as opposed to some wards of Chicago. \n ', ' ', ' A Chicago Sun-Times poll released last month showed that Emanuel would draw just 29 percent of the vote if the election were held then. His 8 percent showing in the survey among black voters, a crucial voting bloc for him last time, creates a truck-size hole for another candidate to drive through. ', ' \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Emanuel still has the upper hand in his battle to retain his job. He has $7 million in the bank and the power of incumbency behind him. The one challenger who gives his supporters agita, Cook County Supervisor Toni Preckwinkle – an African-American woman with name recognition who could fare well in Chicago’s identity politics – has said she’s not running. She also hasn’t closed the door on the prospect, but her campaign account holds a tenth of the cash of Emanuel’s. \n ', ' ', ' As his fundraising gears up for his campaign, Emanuel is hosting a high-dollar event on June 20 with Bill Clinton and indie band The Head and the Heart, according to an email invitation obtained by POLITICO. \n ', ' ', ' Emanuel’s allies say that a Sun-Times poll is an outlier, although they concede he’s not in a comfortable position politically. \n ', ' ', ' “He’s had his challenges,” said James Carville, who’s known Emanuel since the two worked for Bill Clinton. “I think he’ll win reelection but he’s got to run a good campaign. Nothing’s easy in politics.” Ultimately, Carville added, people “have a lot of faith in Rahm.” ', ' \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Another Emanuel ally was blunt that his problem is as much his style as it is the substance of his message. \n ', ' ', ' “There’s a straight-ahead quality to Rahm’s personality that allows him to get things done, but also can be off-putting,” the ally said. \n ', ' ', ' Emanuel declined to be interviewed for this story. A spokeswoman provided this statement: “Leading a great city is a difficult job and there is much work left to do. But under Mayor Emanuel, Chicago is making steady progress in addressing the huge challenges that have built up over decades.” \n ', ' ', ' Ben LaBolt, who was an aide to Emanuel in his first race, said the mayor has tackled “big, burning challenges at a turning point for the city. … The school day is longer and the graduation rate is higher, the murder rate is down after he reintroduced community policing, and he sliced the deficit in half while balancing the budget.” \n ', ' ', ' Still, his adversaries smell blood and plan to make the most of the next year. \n ', ' ', ' “I hope he loses, and I will work very hard to have somebody else [replace him],” said Karen Lewis, the African-American head of the Chicago Teachers Union. Emanuel was widely reported to have said “F—- you, Lewis” during a private meeting with her in 2012 about a new contract. (He ', ' it.) \n ', ' ', ' “If you’ve seen any of the polling, he’s in serious trouble. No one seems to think that he’s doing a very good job. I think he is not suited to this kind of work,” said Lewis, who dubbed him “the murder mayor” last year after a big uptick in crime soon after he took office. \n ', ' ', ' Some of the city’s problems are out of Emanuel’s control, and he’s tried hard to ease crime, with some success. He extended the school day for kindergartners, an achievement he frequently touts. But he’s had difficulty mastering the stagecraft needed to appease different constituencies in big-city politics. \n ', ' ', ' Instead, Emanuel has approached the job like a latter-day Michael Bloomberg, a business-minded centrist without much interest in bending to opposition. Except unlike Bloomberg, he has no personal fortune with which to appease critics and enhance political friendships. \n ', ' ', ' It’s a particularly difficult task at a time when income inequality has driven voters in Democratic-leaning cities further to the left. In Chicago, class politics fall along starkly racial lines. \n ', ' ', ' Lewis recalled telling reporters that Emanuel had used the F-word with her, a move that fanned much of the initial anger among black voters against him. She noted that he demurred when asked by reporters whether he’d said it. \n ', ' ', ' “And that’s where, if there were any stretch of the imagination of having any fear of Rahm Emanuel, it vanished at that moment,” she said. “Because I knew then he wasn’t the bad-ass he claimed to be.” \n ', ' ', ' Succeeding Daley — a beloved figure whose family is etched into the fabric of the city — would be challenging even for a politician without Emanuel’s blunt edges. Daley, whose father was mayor before him, was skilled at the type of interest-group politicking that has bedeviled Emanuel. \n ', ' ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Charles Rangel has defeated his challenger Adriano Espaillat after an acrimonious Democratic primary that tested the strength of the iconic African American congressman in a district with shifting demographics. \n ', ' ', ' The Associated Press called the race Wednesday afternoon, more than 18 hours after polls closed. Espaillat, who barely lost to Rangel in 2012, had refused to concede, and the AP had earlier said the race was too close to call because of outstanding absentee and provisional ballots. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' With 100 percent of precincts reporting in New York’s 13th District, Rangel defeated Espaillat 47 percent to 44 percent, the AP reported. The final vote tallies could still change depending on the incoming absentee and provisional votes, but it appears Espaillat would have a nearly impossible task mathematically in knocking off Rangel. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The 84-year-old Rangel, who is seeking a 23rd term, has said this will be his last campaign. In a statement after he was declared the victor, he thanked the voters in the district for “giving this veteran his one last fight.” He also said he hoped to “begin the healing process of some of [the] division that was created during the course of the campaign.” \n ', ' ', ' There was no immediate statement from the Espaillat camp. Much earlier Wednesday, the 59-year-old Dominican-American state senator, in declining to concede, had released a statement pointing out that in his 2012 race against Rangel, news outlets prematurely called the race for the incumbent only to see the gap close as more votes were counted. \n ', ' ', ' Espaillat campaigned on the idea that Rangel had been in Congress for too long, and that it was time for a fresh face, and for much of the race, Rangel appeared to be the underdog.\xa0 \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Harlem, once regarded as the center of the black cultural experience in America, has seen a recent influx of Hispanics and whites, eroding the congressman’s traditional base of black support. Rangel also saw many of his former allies abandon him and also couldn’t fully shake the cloud that lingered from his ethics censure in 2010. \n ', ' ', ' Win or lose, many political observers believe, Rangel will be the last black House member from the district. But despite the demographic trends, Rangel aggressively wooed the district’s black voters. \n ', ' ', ' He presented himself as a Barack Obama ally — despite failing to get an endorsement from the president — telling voters he wanted to serve in Congress until the end of Obama’s term. In the final days of the contest, he suggested that the GOP’s opposition to the president was in part racially driven. He offered no apologies for his rhetoric, which some of his critics called harsh. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Some of Rangel’s allies called the talk of Harlem’s changing racial face overblown. They argue that Rangel’s performance demonstrated that he’d successfully appealed to both of the district’s dominant racial groups. \n ', ' ', ' “I think people thought, he represents blacks and Hispanics,” said Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, a fellow Congressional Black Caucus member who represents a nearby Queens-based district. “People aren’t looking at the color of your skin. They’re looking at how they’re being represented.” \n ', ' ', ' Other Rangel backers say that voters were swayed because they wanted Rangel — who has said this campaign will be his last — to go out with his head held high. \n ', ' ', ' “As Charlie Rangel has said, ‘This is my last hurrah.’ And people said, ‘He deserves to go out on top,’” said Robert Jackson, a former New York City councilman. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Rangel nonetheless found himself snubbed by former allies in the New York City political establishment, including Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and Comptroller Scott Stringer, who endorsed Espaillat. \n ', ' ', ' Obama also declined to endorse Rangel. The president has been cool to Rangel ever since the congressman endorsed Hillary Clinton over him in the 2008 presidential primary. In 2010, while Rangel was embroiled in the ethics controversy, the president publicly urged him to retire “with dignity” rather than seek reelection. \n ', ' ', ' In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Rangel said that he and Obama “don’t have any problems at all in terms of the agenda,” but noted that he wasn’t running for a Cabinet position. \n ', ' ', ' Speaking to reporters late Tuesday, Rangel insisted he had no hard feelings for those who had not backed him — who, he said, were acting politically. \n ', ' ', ' “In terms of those people who didn’t support me because of their own political aspirations, I don’t see how I can afford to be angry. I really don’t,” he said. “Those of you who know me know I really mean it. They’re ambitious. They make decisions based on whether I win or lose. But fortunately, as my wife will tell you, we can’t think of a political enemy that I have. There may be a whole lot of names that I’ve forgotten. But I can’t waste a lot of time with people who don’t support me.” \n ', ' ', ' Had Rangel lost, it would have brought an end to a congressional career that stretches back to 1970. It was then that Rangel upended Adam Clayton Powell, a legendary figure in black politics, in a Democratic primary. Some drew comparisons between Espaillat’s challenge to Rangel and that earlier contest, which also was seen as a generational fight. \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Obama—who at the time was criticizing his rivals\' support from outside groups—sent the group a letter stressing that supporters should give directly to the campaign, and the Clinton and Edwards campaigns pointed to its existence as a mark of Obama\'s hypocrisy on outside groups. ', "" Obama's stated hostility to independent groups didn't shut down PowerPAC, but it did significantly dampen the flow of money to other ambitious Democratic efforts. Now PowerPAC is among the few independent organizations left supporting Obama. The largest may be America Votes, which coordinates the field organizing of liberal groups, while labor unions are also spending heavily. "", "" PowerPAC is organized as a 501c4 non-profit, so it isn't required to disclose its donors or much of its spending. It reported spending more than $642,000 in direct electioneering—television ads and direct mail—in the primary. Phillips said it spent much more mobilizing voters, an expense which doesn't need to be reported. The group has access to cash—Phillips is the son-in-law of Herb and Marion Sandler, among the largest Democratic donors in the country—though he said he'd been raising outside money for this effort. "", ' In the primary, the group aired radio ads urging black voters to participate, and worked with black groups to encourage turnout in the south and also to turn out Latino voters in states including California and Texas and encourage them to support Obama. ', "" Philips said that, despite the campaign's letter, he sees his group as operating within the spirit of the campaign. "", ' ""Our understanding of what they\'re saying is they don\'t want negative attack ads by outside groups, and we\'ve always respected that and honored that,"" he said. ""We\'ve never understood them to say they don\'t want community based groups increasing civic engagement—that\'s the tradition Barack comes out of himself."" ', "" For the general election, the group is launching two projects. In the black south, it's going to finance existing African-American groups, like local NAACP chapters, to register and mobilize voters. Because Obama has built his campaign largely on volunteers and newcomers to the political process, Philips said, there's a cadre of experienced black organizations and organizers left to be mobilized. "", "" The group will do voter registration work in Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia, Philips said. Philips, who came of political age on Jesse Jackson's campaign for president, said he thought the increases in minority voting this year could transform local political landscapes as Jackson did. "", ' ""It could work the same way, if not even bigger than the Jackson campaign,"" he said. ', ' Philips said his group would spend about seven million dollars in the South, leaving about three million for advertising targeting Hispanic voters in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas. ', "" Obama aides declined to comment on the group's efforts, and also played down the impact of outside groups. "", ' Phillips, though, said he hoped he was building the beginnings of a progressive infrastructure that could stand outside, and to the left of, an Obama presidency. ', ' ""This is long term,"" he said. ', ' ""We think that the excitement about Barack is going to bring out people whose engagement can have a long term impact on the local policy issues within those states.""

0,The media's big miss,"['\n                The political media class is still trying to digest the results of the Cantor loss.', '\n                    By HADAS GOLD', '\n                    Updated ', 'It wasn’t quite Dewey beats Truman — the press didn’t get the story wrong. In this case, they missed it entirely. ', ' The Washington press was shocked on Tuesday evening as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost in the Republican primary to political newcomer Dave Brat. Media organizations that normally brace for big primary nights hadn’t and were woefully caught off guard. Fox News suddenly cut away from a pre-taped episode of “The O’Reilly Factor.” On CNN, Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger initially wasn’t on camera and instead was forced to call into the set. Publications scrambled to get reporters into the field, as only a handful of media were on the ground in Virginia for primary night. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' So how did the legion of journalists who cover “this town” miss one of the biggest political campaign stories in recent memory? Whether it was Washington group think, bad sourcing and worse polling, not enough boots on the ground, or just a plain old election-night surprise wrought by the voters, the political media class is still trying to digest the results. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Mark Murray, senior political editor for NBC News, said in an email there still is the unexpected in American politics. ', ' “[T]hink Scott Brown in Massachusetts in 2010, Hillary Clinton’s 2008 primary win in New Hampshire. It’s a reminder why Election Days are so exciting to cover. And that’s especially true in a race that has little polling (like Virginia last night),” Murray said. “And remembering that there can be surprises makes us better reporters and political observers.” ', ' Of course, it wasn’t just the media that were blindsided. National tea party groups didn’t get behind Brat or direct reporters’ attention to him as a primary challenger to keep an eye on. The outside support that Brat picked up was from ', ' like Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin and Glenn Beck. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “I don’t think this is a matter of the media being asleep,” said New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters. “I think it’s an instance of the whole political establishment being caught off guard by a situation that developed very rapidly in the past week … Last week, their [Brat internal] polling showed them down by double digits.” ', ' The Richmond Times-Dispatch’s Jeff Schapiro, along with some other media, did take notice recently of the growing discontent Cantor was facing. The writer described him in a ', ' as “a well-known political salesman with a product that increasing numbers of activists aren’t buying.” ', ' But even Schapiro said in his columns he didn’t think the House majority leader would lose. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Times-Dispatch Editor Daniel Finnegan said, “I don’t want to sound as though we weren’t surprised. I think we understood there was a race … We were not expecting the result, especially a double-digit margin.” ', ' Steven Ginsberg, The Washington Post’s senior politics editor noted that although the paper had a front-page story on May 13 reporting that Cantor was confronting a “mounting backlash” in his district and had been following Cantor’s issues with the tea party, “We were as surprised as everybody else that Cantor lost.” Nonetheless, the Post did run a piece Tuesday morning ahead of the election which took Cantor’s win as a forgone conclusion, writing, “The question in this race is how large Cantor’s margin of victory will be.” ', ' Reporters also rely heavily on polling for signs of a possible upset in the works and there were scant few. An internal Cantor poll published earlier this month in the Post had him leading by 34 points. Only a survey published by The Daily Caller on June 6 — labeled a “ ', '” — had the contest much closer than expected: Cantor with 52 percent support versus Brat with 40 percent support, and 9 percent undecided. ', ' “Polling in House races is really thin,” New York Times’ data guru David Leonhardt told ', ' who wrote a column on Wednesday headlined, “Why didn’t the data-driven media see Eric Cantor’s defeat coming?” ', ' “It’d be a mistake to pretend that any form of journalism can be clairvoyant,” he said. “The world is too interesting a place for that.” ', ' Sullivan concluded, “… when a race is this important, it ought to get more attention in advance. (If that means less focus on a particular undeclared candidate for president, all the better.)” ', ' Editors at The Associated Press, the wire service that much of the media relies on to call races, said they were surprised by the outcome. ', ' “There were a few signs ahead of time that Cantor could be in trouble, such as the attacks on his immigration positions, which AP’s Erica Werner had smartly reported on before election day,” AP Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee said in an email. “As a result, AP was paying very close attention to the race and we were able to call it early. When covering elections and calling races, we take nothing for granted. That said, it was a surprise, certainly.” ', ' POLITICO Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris said the media organization’s reporter covering the contest had picked up on rumblings. ', ' “Jake Sherman, to his credit, felt something interesting was going on in Cantor’s district and went down there in April to report on Cantor’s political troubles. We ran that story at the top of our website, and it quoted Dave Brat. But my jaw was still dropping, along with many others, when the news broke that Cantor had been defeated,” Harris said in a statement. ', ' Breitbart Washington Editor Jonathan Strong cited two key reasons why Brat was largely ignored by the press — the media’s failure to understand the power of the immigration issue with voters and Cantor aides attempting to push reporters away from covering the race.

', ' The former Rhode Island governor, who just formed an exploratory committee last week, on Thursday morning uttered the words, “that’s why I’m running,” during an appearance on CNN. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' It set off a flurry on social media and the cable news networks before a spokeswoman walked back Chafee’s comments, saying no decisions had been made about formally entering the Democratic race. ', ' Chafee’s slip shows just how fine of a distinction there is between almost-candidates and official candidates. The response to his apparently accidental declaration also shows how much anticipation there is for a challenger to the Hillary Clinton campaign juggernaut. ', ' Chafee is not the only 2016 contender to wander over the linguistic line — Scott Walker ', 'to himself as “a candidate” on “Fox News Sunday” in March. ', ' Theoretically, anyone who says they’re running for president must register with the Federal Election Commission and is then subject to reporting and disclosure requirements. ', ' Paul Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said that Chafee’s statements indicate that he is no longer just considering a run, but has in fact made up his mind to seek the Democratic nomination. “If you make statements that refer to yourself as a candidate, you are a candidate for legal purposes,” he said. ', ' But in reality, he’s not likely to face consequences, even if a formal complaint is filed. The FEC’s response to a complaint can take “anywhere from never to a couple of years,” he said. ', ' There’s also the common-sense take: “The distance between what Hillary Clinton did on Sunday and what Lincoln Chafee’s doing now is like the distance between the sun and the Earth,” said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, a veteran of Al Gore’s and John Kerry’s presidential bids. “I mean, usually you don’t wander into a presidential campaign.” ', ' Chafee, in an interview with POLITICO later on Thursday morning, said his strategy for the road ahead is a simple one. “You get out and meet as many voters as possible in the key states,” he said. “There’s no secret to how to win elections.” ', ' He has scheduled his first campaign stop on May 6 in New Hampshire for the Hillsborough County Democratic Meeting. He said his perch in New England is an advantage in the nation’s first primary. “I can pretty much commute to southern New Hampshire from Rhode Island,” Chafee said. ', ' On paper, Chafee’s resume is presidential caliber: He’s served in the Senate, as governor and as the mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island. But he faces several obstacles to being considered a serious rival to Clinton for the nomination. For one, he only joined the Democratic Party in 2013 — after serving in the Senate as a Republican and running for governor as an independent — and lacks the political infrastructure of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who served for two years as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. ', ' He also lacks the national profile of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she’s not running despite a big grassroots push for her to do so, or even independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has cultivated a large following on social media. ', ' Chafee declined to seek reelection as governor last year in the face of a Democratic primary that many observers believed he could not have won. ', ' He has also said he does not believe he can raise the billion-plus dollars a winning presidential campaign is expected to take in. “Right now that’s not the top priority,” he said on Thursday about fundraising. “I want to make sure people know I’m serious about my record, promoting the character I’ve displayed.” ', ' He is, however, putting some pressure on Clinton, who some in the party believe could use some roughing up in preparation for the later stages of her White House run. Other Democrats considering a run have leveled implicit critiques of Clinton in recent months, but so far only Chafee has been willing to attack her directly. ', ' Since the launch of his exploratory committee last Thursday, Chafee has been sharply critical of the former secretary of state, telling POLITICO last week, “Anybody who voted for the Iraq war should not be president, and certainly anybody who voted for the Iraq war should not lead the Democratic Party into an election.” Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He endorsed Barack Obama for president in February 2008, by which time he was an independent. ', ' He has also criticized Clinton for being “too close to Wall Street,” but has said he agrees with her on many domestic issues, including environmental stewardship.

', ' In a Facebook ', ', the former Florida governor said he will establish a leadership PAC next month to let him travel and talk with voters about the country’s future. The Republican said the move, his clearest statement yet that he will enter the race, came after discussions with his family over Thanksgiving. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,” Bush, 61, wrote a day after delivering a commencement speech in the early primary state of South Carolina. ', ' The son of former President George H.W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush is a favorite of the Republican establishment but has many challenges. While he may be able to raise more money than anyone else in the field, he is vulnerable to attacks from conservatives over his strong support for the Common Core education guidelines, comprehensive immigration reform and other issues. ', ' His move toward a run will also inevitably lead to questions about how he would be different from his brother, who left the White House very unpopular but who has seen his public standing improve over the past six years. Many conservatives were angry about deficit spending and overseas entanglements under George W. Bush.

Chris Christie. Mitt Romney is also said to be taking an increasingly serious look at a third try, however improbable it may be. ', ' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio perhaps has the most to lose from a Bush candidacy. Rubio served in the state legislature when Bush was governor, and they share many donors — though Rubio has broadened his network over four years in the Senate. ', ' Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Tuesday that the senator’s decision will not be driven by who else is in the field. ', ' “Marco has a lot of respect for Governor Bush, and believes he would be a formidable candidate,” Conant said in a statement. “However, Marco’s decision on whether to run for President or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the American Dream — not on who else might be running.” ', ' In private conversations, Romney has been critical of Bush’s prospects, pointing to his business background and wariness of another Bush in the White House.

', ' One consideration in moving ahead quickly is that Bush can now be the first to make “the ask” of major donors to get behind him, even without legally creating a campaign infrastructure.

0,Dems' best shot in Mississippi,"['\n                    By ', 'JACKSON, MISS. — Democrats were crossing their fingers that Chris McDaniel would be the Republican nominee in Mississippi. ', ' But since Sen. Thad Cochran has prevailed, they are trying to do the unthinkable — unseat a six-term GOP senator. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' McDaniel might have been the better Republican for former Rep. Travis Childers to face in November, but now Democrats are banking on Cochran’s strategy of trying to woo Democrats and blacks, which has upset tea party activists, to their advantage. ', ' McDaniel supporters are irate that Cochran won a GOP primary by reaching across the aisle. Now some of his backers are ambivalent about whether they’ll come out at all in November — and if they don’t, that could create a rare opening for a Democrat here. ', ' For his part, Childers said he is prepared to take on the Mississippi Republican machine and recapture the black vote that went for Cochran in the primary runoff. He also wants to take a page out of the Cochran campaign’s playbook — expand the electorate. ', ' “Anyone who says it is an easy sail to victory for [Cochran], or anyone else, I would remind them that this seat isn’t owned by anyone but the people of the state of Mississippi,” Childers said. “There are a lot of disenfranchised Republican voters out there.” ', ' The real question for Childers is what will those tea party activists who fervently supported McDaniel do. Frustrated by Cochran’s campaign tactic of trying to get Democrats who didn’t vote in the June 3 primary to cast a ballot in the runoff Tuesday, many McDaniel supporters at his election night head quarters furiously chanted, “We’re not going with Thad.” ', ' Childers said he is going to be going after every eligible Mississippi voter. ', ' “I’ve had broad support before of Republicans, independents, my message to any Mississippi voters is you are welcome in our camp,” Childers said. “We have enough seats at the table. … You don’t have to sit on the floor and you don’t have to eat crumbs.” ', ' In part, for Childers to just run a competitive race is helpful to Democrats. By expanding the map, Childers could force Republicans to spend money in Mississippi, thus diverting it from other states as they try to gain the Senate majority. Outside Republican groups dumped millions into Mississippi in the 2014 cycle, an enormous sum compared to previous cycles. ', ' Childers said he hopes the GOP stops dumping in so much money but acknowledged that he, too, will need cash from national Democratic groups to make inroads in the state. ', ' Childers will also have to motivate black voters and moderate conservatives to vote for him, much as he did in the 2008 special election in which he won his House seat. A conservative Democrat, Childers has opposed gay marriage, is anti-abortion and anti-gun control. Still, he found himself swept out of office in 2010 following voter frustration over President Barack Obama’s health care law, although he didn’t support it. ', ' National Democratic operatives have been focused on Mississippi for months. Several senators, including Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Michael Bennet, have already ', ' contributions to Childers from their political action committees. Childers also banked significant cash at an April fundraiser in Washington at which House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer cut him a check for $2,500. ', ' The Mississippi Democratic Party is nearly nonexistent and doesn’t have the infrastructure to try and mount a credible campaign against Cochran. He will be counting on Democratic outside groups and the party committees — many of which have already pledged support — to funnel in money in order to make an aggressive play for the seat. ', ' Some conservative activists think Cochran’s primary runoff victory will ensure his defeat in November. ', ' “There is zero chance of him winning because he is so vilified,” said Ray Nicholson, founder and former chairman of the Mississippi Tea Party. “He’s so alienated at least half of the Republican Party that they are not going to come out for him.” ', ' Laura Van Overschelde, head of the Mississippi Tea Party, said the group has “180,000 voters who said no to the political machine” in the McDaniel-Cochran race. ', ' It’s unclear whether they will make a concerted effort to thwart Cochran’s campaign. ', ' Barry Neyrey, chairman of the South Mississippi Tea Party, said that, though he is frustrated, it is hard to imagine a Childers victory in the Magnolia State. ', ' “That’s hard to imagine that [Cochran] would lose. Mississippi is conservative,” Neyrey said. “There is still a chance to have Republican control of the Senate. As angry as we’ll be, we still have common sense, and we can’t let communists take over the country.” ', ' Childers said many Mississipians feel as though they’ve been forgotten.

0,Alan Grayson erupts as Senate bid looms,"['\n                    By ', ' and ', '\n                    Updated ', 'As he faces the pressures of a potential Senate bid in the nation’s biggest swing state, Florida Rep. Alan Grayson has hurled angry expletives at reporters and described his likely rival in crude terms during a tense conversation with the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ', ' For all of his outbursts, Grayson has been inventive with his slurs. On Wednesday, he bizarrely accused one reporter of being a “s—-ing robot” — a phrase that’s sure to become part of his legacy of incendiary remarks, which include branding a lobbyist a “K Street whore,” likening the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan and accusing a Christian conservative opponent of being a member of the Taliban. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Grayson, who wouldn’t comment on his tirades, didn’t dispute participating in a difficult phone call a few weeks previously with DSCC Chairman Jon Tester, who informed the representative that the committee would likely soon endorse Rep. Patrick Murphy. Grayson denied he directly swore at Tester — as two sources alleged — but he wouldn’t comment on what he said. ', ' “What’s the deal here? You publish whatever colorful lies people toss your way, for their own obvious political purposes?” Grayson asked via text message. ', ' Tester’s spokesman at the DSCC declined to comment. However, in multiple interviews with Democrats from Washington to Florida, it’s clear that the Montana senator tried to pressure Grayson to stay out of the Senate race because Democratic establishment figures believe he’s unelectable in a statewide race. ', ' “You’re making a mistake,” Grayson said, likening Murphy to a piece of excrement. “When I’m a senator, it’s going to be hard to work together.” ', ' If that happened, Tester chuckled, he was certain they would be able to work together after all. After the conversation, sources said, Tester made up his mind not only to support Murphy but to publicly endorse him and steer more money to his campaign. ', ' The DSCC decision and conversation clearly surprised Grayson, who is still mulling whether to officially get in the race. Weeks before, he made sure to boast about meeting with the DSCC, and he went out of his way to cast doubt on a previous POLITICO report that said Murphy was favored by Senate Democratic leaders. ', ' Already known for his outspokenness, Grayson became more irascible after the conversation with Tester and lost his cool with three separate reporters from different media outlets. ', ' The most recent case occurred Wednesday when Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith phoned Grayson to ask the Orlando Democrat about having incorporated a couple of Cayman Islands hedge funds where potential investors could avoid taxes. At the same time, Grayson has built up his public persona as a populist Wall Street-bashing firebrand who criticizes conservative tax-avoiders. ', ' “When I set up my investment funds I set it up like everyone else,” Grayson ', ', saying he established the funds on the advice of an unnamed attorney. The paper, he said to Smith, was trying to find “some stupid, bull—— story. … You want to write sh— about it, and you can’t because not a single dollar of taxes has been avoided.” ', ' Since no funds had yet been invested, Smith asked about the propriety of establishing the funds in anticipation of getting foreign investors. ', ' “Are you f—-ing kidding? I set up a fund that might solicit foreign investors. … I have no present intention of soliciting foreign investors,” Grayson said, according to the report. “Your perception issue is bulls—-.” ', ' Grayson then began complaining about ', ' that reported his girlfriend, biotech entrepreneur Dena Minning, had reached out to at least one Democratic-leaning group to put herself forward as a potential congressional candidate to run for Grayson’s Orlando-area House seat if he runs for the Senate. Neither Grayson nor Minning would comment to POLITICO, but he brought up the story to Smith when he trashed the new line of questioning about his finances. ', ' “This is even worse than Grayson’s girlfriend might run for Congress 18 months from now,” Grayson said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “This is a whole ’nother level of bulls—-. … Are are you some kind of s—-ing robot? You go around s—-ing on … people?” ', ' Smith wasn’t the only reporter to bear the brunt of Grayson’s rage recently. After a POLITICO story ran last week, Orlando Sentinel reporter Scott Powers finally reached the congressman on his cellphone. Grayson refused to comment but instead swore at Powers using the f-word. ', ' Powers wouldn’t comment on the conversation but confirmed he was unable to get anything printable from Grayson. ', ' After the incident with Smith came to light on Wednesday, a National Journal reporter, Eric Michael Garcia, said via Twitter that he was “chewed out” by Grayson recently for asking about whether the congressman’s girlfriend was angling for his seat if he ran for Senate. “It’s becoming a rite of passage,” Garcia wrote. “He told me it was so speculative he wasn’t even going to answer it and then tore into me.” ', ' While Grayson’s outspoken nature and trenchant wit have earned him a following of dedicated liberal activists — he’s fond of saying it would make him the favorite in a primary against Murphy — many Democratic operatives and establishment figures believe he’s essentially unelectable. ', ' and ', ' “He is not a shoo-in in a Democratic primary. He is a powder keg waiting to be lit,” said Steve Vancore, a Democratic consultant who’s unaffiliated with a candidate. “Yes, he might appeal to some liberals. But how does he win in North Florida, how does he win Tampa Bay Democrats, where the sentiment is much more moderate?” ', ' Vancore likened Grayson to Allen West, the outspoken former Republican congressman and tea party darling who lost a conservative-leaning seat because of his over-the-top antics. “Alan Grayson can raise money from a portion of the MSNBC-watching crowd, but he has zero appeal in the middle,” said Vancore. “And in the end, Democrats are like Republicans: They want a candidate who can win a general election.” ', ' Democrats hope Murphy’s fundraising ability and his centrist voting record will be a plus in the general election. But Grayson and his backers say Murphy’s record hasn’t been Democratic enough and make him vulnerable in a primary. ', ' At the same time, conservative GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis has announced his Senate candidacy and is expected to face a challenge from Lt. Gov. Carlos López-Cantera. Just as DeSantis is running to the right, Grayson looks like he plans to run to the left in his primary. ', ' Grayson gained a measure of fame among liberals at the height of battle over Obamacare. The little-known Florida freshman leapt into the national spotlight when he ', ' that Republicans’ health care plan was, “Don’t get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.” When GOP lawmakers demanded an apology, Grayson went back to the House floor to mock the request and said: “I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven’t voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.” ', ' The controversy worked — to a degree. Grayson became the progressive counterweight to the tea party. And campaign contributions flowed. ', ' Later that year, he started a website called NamesOfTheDead.com, aimed at drawing attention to a Harvard University study that said every year, more than 44,000 Americans die because they don’t have health insurance. Republicans said the site violated House and campaign finance rules because it linked to Grayson’s campaign website, while ', ' that several fake names were on the list, including “Wile E. Coyote, 55, Sedona, Arizona.” The website was eventually removed. ', ' But he still lost reelection in the 2010 Republican wave. A new Orlando-area Democratic district drawn after the state gained two seats in reapportionment allowed him to return to the House in 2013. ', ' The “die quickly” incident was not Grayson’s only controversial incident. In 2009, he called lobbyist Linda Robertson, an adviser to then-Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, a “K-Street whore,” in a radio interview. He later ', ' for the comment. ', ' Grayson saves no kind words for his Republican counterparts. In 2009, he called them “utterly unscrupulous … these are foot-dragging, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals who know nothing but ‘no.’” He compared former Vice President Dick Cheney to a vampire ', ', saying that he had “trouble listening to what [Cheney] says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he’s talking.” At a fundraiser with Vice President Joe Biden, Grayson joked that Cheney gave Biden a tour of the White House “dungeon” and invited him to “go waterboarding” with him, the ', ' in 2009. He also ', ' that Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio show host, was “more lucid when he was a drug addict.” ', ' During his 2010 race, Grayson’s campaign misleadingly edited a speech from Republican opponent Daniel Webster that made him sound as though he believed women should blindingly “submit” to their husbands. The ad, which called Webster “Taliban Dan,” was given a “Pants-on-Fire” designation by PolitiFact. ', ' In 2013, his insults reached new heights when he compared the tea party to the KKK in a fundraising email that included an image of a burning cross and added “[T]ea Party” to the picture. Despite criticism, he did not backtrack, ', 'that he is “calling them out on their hate.” ', ' Meanwhile, Grayson has been involved in an ugly divorce from his wife, whom he accused of bigamy. She, in turn, has accused him of infidelity. Though he won reelection in 2014 amid the divorce, it’s likely to surface in a statewide race, ushering in a new round of uncomfortable questions from reporters and potential outbursts from Grayson.

0,"Poll: Dems need blue-collar voters, unmarried women","['\n                    By MAGGIE HABERMAN', '\n                    Updated ', 'Democrats’ future in 2016 hinges largely on performing better with white working-class voters and unmarried women, as the party looks toward the presidential election with Hillary Clinton as its front-runner, a new Democracy Corps poll shows. ', ' The poll, a joint project of pollster Stan Greenberg and Page Gardner of Women’s Voices Women’s Vote, will be released Friday. It focuses on the direction of the Democratic Party moving forward after a brutal midterm cycle that cost it the Senate majority and a number of governorships. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' There are positive points for the Democrats, such as an improved voter mood nationally since the election. President Barack Obama is also viewed more positively, while congressional Republicans have not seen their brand improve, according to the survey. The right track/wrong track numbers are also trending more positively for the outgoing president. ', ' “Obama’s stronger, and people are more optimistic about where the country’s going,” Greenberg said in an interview, noting that Obama is now at 48 percent approval. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' In the few horse-race matchups from the poll, Clinton beats out Mitt Romney by 6 percentage points and Jeb Bush by 12 points, the survey found. ', ' But the Democrats will have work to do to leave a more positive impression among blue-collar voters and unmarried women to get their support at the levels necessary to win the White House. ', ' “White working class voters will be key: Whether 2016 can be turned into a big enough year to take back a lot of territory in the Congress and states and whether the presidential candidate can build a formidable wall depends on Democrats and Hillary Clinton doing better with white working class voters, both men and women,” the pollsters say in their summary of key findings. ', ' The poll found that the “Rising American Electorate” comprises changing demographics, and key constituencies like college-educated women have strong support for Clinton. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The challenge, the pollsters found, is for Democrats to tap into persuasive economic messaging for blue-collar voters and for unmarried women, who tend to vote on policies that are appealing to families. For instance, Clinton gets just 32 percent of white non-college-educated voters against Romney. ', ' “Both unmarried women and blue collar whites see the path to the middle class as increasingly precarious and feel that they are not doing as well as they should be — Jobs do not pay enough to live on, and while the middle class pays a lot in taxes they do not feel the country works for them,” the pollsters wrote in their findings. ', ' Still, those groups are likelier to be persuaded by a reform message about fixing a broken system and “gridlocked government” than what Republicans are offering, the pollsters say. And, in what could be critical for Clinton as she begins to formulate her messaging, discussing pay equity doesn’t appear to have a negative impact with male voters. ', ' Democrats have been focused heavily on shifting demographics as critical to success in upcoming elections, as Republicans have fared much better among a slowly diminishing white-voter population. But the 2014 midterm races showed that the coalition of voters that vaulted Obama to national victory can’t be presumed to be Democratic voters. And Democratic strategists have repeatedly said the party lacked a strong message to appeal to working-class voters last November. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Gloominess about the country’s direction was worst among unmarried women, with just 36 percent saying things are heading the right way. Among white non-college-educated voters, a mere 20 percent said the country is going the right way, and a dismal 19 percent of white voters said the same thing. ', ' “Voters are still getting squeezed,” Gardner said. “But, the research suggests that unmarried women could provide Democratic presidential candidates with a winning advantage if their concerns about their economic well-being are addressed.” ', ' The pollsters surveyed 950 registered voters from Jan. 7 to Jan. 11.

0,Who are the 1 percent who've never heard of Hillary?,"['\n                        ', '\n                        A tiny percentage of voters tell pollsters they’ve “never heard of” Hillary Clinton. Who the heck are they?', '\n                    By ', 'Call them “the other 1 percent.” ', ' They could be standing in line behind us at the grocery store, sitting beside us at the ballpark or holding up traffic as they jaywalk, blithely responding to political polls on their cellphones. They’re the tiny sliver of registered voters who regularly show up in national surveys as having “never heard of” Hillary Clinton, and even the pollsters don’t know who the heck these people are. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Through two terms as first lady, a third in the Senate, a historic presidential run and close to a million miles of world travel logged as secretary of state, Clinton has been named the country’s most-admired woman 19 times and been the subject of two decades of nonstop media scrutiny. If she isn’t overexposed, then no one is. So, who are the 1 percent of Americans who have telephones, apparently are registered to vote and yet claim the name “Hillary Clinton” rings no bells? ', ' “They’re a small, select group,” said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, who had nothing to say about them beyond that. They showed up in polls last month from Fox News and The George Washington University, but the Pew Research Center is also at a loss to explain them. “The group is too small to break out and analyze,” wrote a Pew spokeswoman. ', ' It’s possible they’re more myth than reality. “The error factor’s 3.2 percent. So they may exist. They may not exist,” said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who co-conducted the May GWU poll. For comparison, about 1 percent of respondents in that poll were also “unsure” of their own age or refused to divulge it. “There’s a certain number of people who go through life clueless,” he said. ', ' and ', ' “Quite frankly, it’s not a big enough group to look at,” said Goeas, who nonetheless was game to glance at the poll’s cross tabs — the demographic breakdowns of every answer to every question — and take a few guesses. The “never heard of” responses tick up slightly among ticket-splitters, voters in Florida and those who believe “retirement” is the economic issue the next president should focus on. “My sense is that this is older voters who quite frankly are very apolitical,” said Goeas, though he cautioned, because of the minuscule sample size, “You just can’t draw any conclusions.” ', ' There’s also evidence of Hillary obliviousness among the very young. A poll conducted last spring of 18- to 29-year-olds by Harvard’s Institute of Politics found 5 percent of respondents (about 150 people ) had never heard of the woman who was making Whitewater a ', ' before some of them were even born. The rate was higher among younger millennials and Hispanics, especially those who preferred to speak Spanish, according to IOP head pollster John Della Volpe, who noted the survey was conducted online and wasn’t restricted to registered voters. He said some of the respondents may not have been U.S. citizens. ', ' Given the murkiness of the data, there seemed only one way to prove the existence of these rare birds of the polling world — field work. POLITICO ventured into the teeming throng around Boston’s Faneuil Hall. We started with single men — another group the GWU poll hinted had a high Clinton cluelessness rate — especially those who looked a little lost. ', ' “I don’t know what is Hillary Clinton,” protested Martin Reras, 35, as he looked up from examining a map. But after we repeated the name more slowly, it turned out that Reras, who was visiting from Buenos Aires, did know what Hillary Clinton is. “Ah! The political girl?” Reras asked. Not only do he and his countrymen know her, he said, they like her. ', ' Obaid Safi, 31, moved to the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester from Afghanistan in October, but he has already heard of Hillary Clinton. “She was a prime minister?” asked Safi, as he stood outside a Uniqlo pop-up shop, greeting customers in a mock kimono. Safi said he’d seen clips of Clinton speaking on BBC News and YouTube, but that he remains undecided about her. “I wish to find out much more about her life.” ', ' A man wearing balloons on his head looked like a good bet, especially when he indicated uncertainty about his age (“It’s about 48.”). But balloon salesman Stephen Uys was quite sure about Clinton. “She’s a professional. She has experience from the State Department. I respect the way she’s made money,” said Uys, who’s appalled by the way “she’s been pilloried by the right” for “that Benghazi bullshit.” ', ' Perhaps the 1 percent who claim not to know Clinton is just made up of wise guys, the kind of people who would identify themselves to a reporter as “Tejas Dikshit,” as Tejas Dikshit did while sitting with friends on a bench outside the hall. But after offering several forms of identification, Dikshit, a 24-year-old consultant, proved his name to be genuine. “It’s a fairly common surname in India,” he said, laughing (it is). (He pointed out that the really odd name belongs to the junior senator from Kentucky. “Rand” means prostitute in Hindi, Dikshit said.) And, yes, Dikshit, who cannot vote in the U.S., is familiar with Clinton. ', ' Finally, expanding the search yielded a single blank look. ', ' “Who?” said Takar Jacques, who had replaced Safi outside of Uniqlo. ', ' Jacques, 21, was born in the United States and is pretty sure she’s on the voter rolls. “They made it very important to register to vote. I just kind of didn’t go [vote]. Do you have to?” said Jacques. Her mother was born in Haiti, and she cited Facebook and Upworthy as her typical sources of news. She said she’s been keeping an eye on President Barack Obama and that she has come around to support him in the past year as she’s heard him talk about raising the minimum wage and expanding health care coverage: “Things that have to do with me.” ', ' But even Jacques, who said she pays little attention to politics, took only a moment to recall: “Hillary Clinton is a white female woman running for some political position. I think president.” And of course, Jacques had an opinion. “I don’t really like her.” ', ' The good news for Clinton is that Jacques is unlikely to vote. Slightly more tuned-in, and therefore perhaps more politically relevant, is that other rare breed: the registered voters — 5 percent in an April Quinnipiac poll — who “haven’t heard enough” about Clinton to form an opinion.

The 49-year-old senator has a reliably liberal record, though he’s clearly to the right of Sens.

Because I think if that’s the case there would be regret among 100 senators, regardless of the party,” Booker said. “Is there a way to get back to creating a body that deals by comity and serves the American purpose?”', 'The party’s energy is clearly concentrated among younger, more progressive activists. But more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate most likely to vote in primaries is 40 and older, a statistical reality that potentially benefits a candidate who is viewed as more in the middle and focused on pursuing bipartisanship.', 'Though Booker brandishes a progressive form of politics and is eager to seize the spotlight at committee hearings, he’s also developed surprisingly close relationships with conservative Republicans like Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina.

For instance, Booker argues a Democratic Senate majority could use budget reconciliation to repeal the GOP tax cuts without gutting the 60-vote threshold for legislation. People close to Booker say he’s unlikely to be the first to explicitly endorse killing the filibuster or expanding the Supreme Court.', 'His stances track neatly with a record that leans left, with an occasional tack toward the center.', 'He routinely votes against Trump’s nominees, endorses the “Green New Deal” and “Medicare for All” and said he’d risk expulsion in his fight against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.', 'But he also took weeks before declaring', 'his eventual support for Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, drew flak for opposing a measure aimed at importing drugs from Canada and made liberals squirm way back in the 2012 presidential campaign when he called attacks on Mitt Romney’s old firm Bain Capital “nauseating.” ', ' In the previous Congress, Booker', 'worked closely with Trump aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner to reform criminal justice laws, while teaming with Grassley and Trump ally Sen.

And he is critical when necessary. But not critical as a way of simply attracting folks to a conversation,” Scott, the Republican senator, said of Booker.', ' It’s also not clear whether process reforms resonate with voters, anyway.', ' “In Iowa, how many people are going to vote on your position on the Supreme Court? … It’s probably a mistake to overhype the power of some of those process litmus tests,” said Sen.

0,Jeb Bush's burden,"[""\n                        He backed his brother's wars. Now he's listening to George W.'s advisers, too."", '\n                    By ', 'In the late 1990s, a group of conservatives issued a manifesto calling for a stronger, “Reaganite” American foreign policy. The 25 signatories to the founding statement of the Project for the New American Century — a new think tank urging larger defense budgets, democracy promotion and bolder American leadership — consisted of several leaders of the emerging neoconservative movement, including Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis “Scooter” Libby and Bill Kristol. \n ', ' ', ' One signer stood out for his near-total lack of foreign policy experience: Jeb Bush, then a candidate for Florida governor. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' But when the same group sent a letter the following year to President Bill Clinton, calling for the ouster of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Bush’s name was absent. And as the group’s founders pressed for war with Iraq after Sept. 11, 2001, Bush played no visible role. \n ', ' ', ' What that might say about Bush’s foreign policy philosophy is unclear. But as he gears up for a 2016 presidential run, Bush’s rivals and supporters alike are studying such tea leaves for insight into his worldview. As Florida governor, Bush compiled a long domestic record on issues like education and immigration. Yet at a moment when America is winding down one war and ramping up another, he remains untested and opaque when it comes to war and peace. \n ', ' ', ' “It’s fair to say that Jeb’s views on foreign policy are still in some level of formation. He’s a former governor, and he doesn’t have foreign policy experience that people can easily point to,” said Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for the George W. Bush White House. \n ', ' ', ' But, Fleischer adds, there are some signs of a philosophy: “It seems as if he will come out of the more muscular peace-through-strength wing of the party,” Fleischer said. \n ', ' ', ' Indeed, some of Bush’s most important allies within the GOP foreign policy establishment are closely associated with his brother, whose name is almost synonymous with a war in Iraq that most Americans call a mistake. \n ', ' ', ' Jeb Bush’s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is a board member of an education foundation Bush chairs, and with whom he is personally close. And soon after leaving office in 2009, Cheney, who cares most about national security, told Fox News that he is “a big fan of Jeb’s.” Bush has also impressed one of the GOP’s wealthiest donors, the hawkish casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. \n ', ' ', ' Conservative foreign policy insiders say that what’s known about Bush’s views places him in the dominant interventionist wing of his party, which is still shaped by his co-signatories on the 1997 Project for the New American Century document. He has challenged the anti-interventionist views of Sen. Rand Paul and his supporters. \n ', ' ', ' But those conservatives also note that while Jeb’s brother, George W., is remembered for a controversially bold foreign policy, his father, former President George H.W. Bush, charted a more pragmatic approach. The elder Bush, for instance, did not act to remove Saddam from power after expelling him from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. \n ', ' ', ' Jeb Bush is “a traditional Republican internationalist,” says Gary Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a founder of the Project for the New American Century. “I don’t think there’s anything out of the mainstream of that part of the party.” \n ', ' ', ' Still, Bush could face a unique challenge in his direct relation to the president who waged a hugely unpopular war in Iraq. \n ', ' ', ' While George W. Bush’s poll numbers have risen since he left office, public opinion about his 2003 invasion of Iraq hasn’t budged. A mid-October NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 66 percent of of those surveyed believe the Iraq War was “not worth it.” \n ', ' ', ' After signing the Project for the New American Century’s 1997 founding principles, Bush had no visible role as the group’s leaders pressed in subsequent years for a U.S. showdown with Saddam. (Schmitt downplayed the significance of Bush’s signature on the founding document. “I don’t know if that tells you very much,” he said.) \n ', ' ', ' And during his brother’s presidency, Jeb Bush largely avoided the explosive politics of the Iraq War. \n ', ' ', ' But not entirely. In April 2006, Bush joined three other governors to visit U.S. troops in Iraq, where he called progress in the country “undeniable,” even as Iraq descended into civil war. \n ', ' ', ' Jeb Bush’s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. | AP Photo ', '\n  ', ' ', ' Yet Bush qualified his support for the endeavor, adding: “In a mission this ambitious, and this extensive, is it possible that mistakes were made? Of course, it is. After the fact, it’s easy to harp and to criticize, and, frankly, people have the right to do it.” \n ', ' ', ' His more recent public remarks on the war have been less equivocal, however. \n ', ' ', ' “A lot of things in history change over time. I think people will respect the resolve that my brother showed, both in defending the country and the war in Iraq,” Bush told CNN in March 2013. \n ', ' ', ' Walking a line between support for his brother, still popular among Republicans, and distancing himself from his more unpopular policies, will be one of Jeb Bush’s main challenges, says Peter Feaver, a George W. Bush White House national security aide who focused on Iraq. \n ', ' ', ' “I think any Republican is going to have to figure out how to talk about the [George W.] Bush presidency — both domestic policy and foreign — in a way that does not divide the party and does not play into Democratic critiques. And also to make it clear that they’re their own person, and they are confronting the world as it is in 2016 and not merely stuck in 2002,” Feaver said. \n ', ' ', ' “Jeb’s challenge is a little different because of his last name. But in some sense, he has more running room because of that — he can offer criticisms without being accused of disloyalty,” Feaver added. \n ', ' ', ' For the moment, Bush has refrained from analyzing his own party and stuck to attacks on President Barack Obama. He has mocked Obama’s so-called leading from behind strategy and called for a stronger U.S. alliance with Israel and a tougher stance on Iran. All were familiar talking points in Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. \n ', ' ', ' Bush sounded similar themes in a March address to a meeting of Adelson’s Republican Jewish Coalition, where he assailed Obama as passive and warned conservatives against the temptation of withdrawal from the world. Bush also met privately with Adelson and satisfied him on the issue he and his wife hold most dear. \n ', ' ', ' “The Adelsons are confident that Jeb Bush is an advocate for Israel,” says a source close to the couple. \n ', ' ', ' More recently, in a Dec. 2 speech to a Florida group that backs democracy in Cuba, Bush said Obama has “retrenched” abroad, with dangerous consequences. \n ', ' ', ' “In this unstable and uncertain world, the United States has actually played a part in creating greater instability and greater unraveling,” Bush told the U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC. \n ', ' ', ' Bush did offer one kind word for the president. “Thankfully, I think he’s seen the light in Afghanistan,” Bush said, an apparent reference to Obama’s recent extension of some U.S. combat operations there. But he added that withdrawing troops from the country “simply because it is politically expedient is the wrong thing to do.” \n ', ' ', ' In the same remarks, Bush suggested that a hasty exit created the current crisis in Iraq. Some Republicans think the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant offers Bush a potent comeback against assaults on his brother’s legacy. \n ', ' ', ' And they note that the most likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, will be constrained in her discussion of Iraq by her 2002 Senate vote to authorize military force against Saddam’s regime. \n ', ' ', ' Even so, Democrats would be sure to hang Jeb Bush’s brother’s unpopular foreign policy legacy around his neck. In response to Bush’s December remarks in Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said Obama had restored America’s standing “after the disastrous foreign policy blunders of the George W. Bush administration.” \n ', ' ', ' The same arguments may also come from within Bush’s own party, where Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is harshly critical of U.S. intervention abroad and calls the Iraq War a colossal blunder. \n ', ' ', ' Some conservatives say Bush could respond by invoking the legacy of his father, who presided over the mostly peaceful collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and built a diverse international coalition behind the Gulf War. \n ', ' ', ' “The optimal Jeb Bush foreign policy would be something along the same principles as his brother George, but perhaps more savvy about carrying them out, with the hard-headedness of his father,” Schmitt said. \n ', ' ', ' But Jeb Bush himself rejects the idea that his brother’s legacy presents any special problem. He addressed the question on “Fox News Sunday” in March 2013. \n ', ' ', ' “I don’t think there’s any Bush baggage at all,” he said. \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Plus, it was a leading player in pushing through minimum wage increases in more than 15 states. ', ' It’s planning an aggressive door-to-door campaign ahead of 2016, said Nussbaum, who declined to discuss funding sources for the effort. She said Working America sees Democracy Alliance primarily as a place to forge collaborations with like-minded groups, not as a funding source. ', ' Yet the donor profiles produced for her group suggest the efforts to build collaborations and high-dollar fundraising relationships are not mutually exclusive. ', ' The profiles — like those prepared by development staffs across Washington ahead of prospecting meetings — include donors’ contribution histories, pet causes, hometowns, spouses’ names, etc. ', ' Investor Sandor Straus and his wife, Faye Straus, are described as “genuine progressives [who] have given $10k to [Working America] through the DA for past two years” — donations that previously have not been disclosed.

VOGEL', 'Politico ', ' ', 'When Paul Manafort met Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s, each had something the other wanted.', 'Marcos, then in his third decade as leader of the Philippines, had developed a reputation in Washington as a stalwart ally in the fight against communism. But he was facing rising concerns about rampant corruption, plundering of public resources and human rights violations under his increasingly despotic leadership, during which Amnesty International now estimates 34,000 people were tortured and 3,240 killed. Meanwhile, Marcos amassed a fortune estimated at $10 billion, spending big on paintings by Pissarro and Manet, a fleet of private planes and helicopters and Mercedes-Benzes.', 'Story Continued Below', 'Manafort, then in his 30s, was a hotshot Republican operative who had made his name helping Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, and was pioneering a new form of international political consulting. The model, which allowed him to indulge his taste for the high-life, parlayed his clout with the emergent conservative ruling class into lucrative gigs representing foreign leaders looking to buff their reputations in Washington.', 'A Marcos front group would eventually hire Manafort to try to help him retain his grip on power, agreeing to pay Manafort’s firm ', ' — one of the first big foreign gigs landed by the firm. But back then, during the Wild West days of the international political industry, there was more buzz in Washington and Manila about Manafort’s proximity to Marcos during a period of epic spending to support a lavish lifestyle and to curry favor with influential Americans.', 'One example, according to documents, including some published here for the first time: Marcos earmarked huge sums of cash for Reagan’s 1980 and 1984 campaigns — as much as $57 million, according to one claim made to Philippine investigators. There’s no evidence that any cash ever made it into Reagan’s coffers, which would have been illegal since U.S. election laws ban donations from foreigners. And, despite extensive government investigations on both sides of the Pacific into the freewheeling spending of the Marcos regime, there’s never before been much serious inquiry of what ultimately happened to the cash intended for political contributions. The lack of a transparent paper trail — combined with the larger than life personas of Marcos and Manafort — spawned a swirl of theories.', 'In a phone interview this month, Manafort, now 67, acknowledged that for the better part of 30 years, he’s been dealing with speculation that he accepted millions of dollars in Marcos’s cash — either as a bonus or as a donation intended for Reagan.', '“It was circulating way back when, when people were out to just pass rumors and things about me. It’s old stuff that never had any legs anywhere,” said Manafort. “It’s totally fiction,” he said, asserting that every penny he received from Marcos’ allies was disclosed to the U.S. Justice Department in mandatory filings. “We’d have done everything by the book,” he said, attributing persistent claims to the contrary to rivals and former colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and suggesting that some are reviving the talk now for political purposes.', 'After largely ', ' for the past 20 years to build to a portfolio of foreign clients, Manafort ', ' as a key adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. He was quickly promoted to ', ', and has been working to put his international affiliations behind him (when POLITICO asked him to describe his relationship with Marcos, he laughed and said, “I’ve got to go”).', 'But Trump’s broadsides against the corrupt political establishment — and his ', ' on the foreign cash raised by the charitable foundation of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton — continue to bring attention to the often-secretive international work that became Manafort’s lifeblood.

Yet, one of Manafort’s business partners now says that Manafort neglected to inform him of the firm’s contract with the dictator. That created some embarrassment and raised concerns about a style that several of his former associates portrayed as mercenary and envelope-pushing.', 'POLITICO found that Manafort worked more closely than previously known with Marcos and his wife, Imelda, in Manila, where Manafort and his associates advised the couple on electoral strategy, and in Washington, where they worked to retain goodwill by tamping down concerns about the Marcos regime’s human rights record, theft of public resources, and ultimately their perpetration of a massive vote-rigging effort to try to stay in power in the Philippines’ 1986 presidential election.', 'In the run-up to that election, aides to Marcos’s leading opponent Corazon Aquino invoked Manafort’s role with the dictator “to vilify Marcos” with the intelligentsia, said Teddy Locsin, a prominent Philippine journalist and operative who worked for Aquino on that campaign. While Aquino also had help from Westerners — the prominent international consulting firm Sawyer Miller ', "" from her campaign, which appears to have been mostly expense reimbursements — her team found Manafort an appealing target. In the words of Locsin, who was later elected to Congress, “Manafort's name was like Voldemort today.”"", '***', ' on Reagan’s 1980 campaign. A trio of young operatives had been working together in Reagan’s political shop — Manafort as convention director, Charlie Black as field director and Roger Stone as director of the Southern operation — until Black found himself out of a job when the campaign shuffled its hierarchy after the New Hampshire primary. So he started a political consulting firm, which Manafort and Stone joined in short order. The firm quickly began working for Reagan’s campaign, as well as the Republican National Committee and a handful of GOP congressional candidates.', 'After Reagan won, the firm built a steady, if unspectacular, business representing Republicans from Northeastern moderates like Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey to southern conservatives like Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Paula Hawkins of Florida.', 'But it wasn’t until after Reagan’s 1984 reelection, on which the firm’s founding partners worked extensively, that the swaggering 30-somethings really began making their mark on Washington’s hidebound consulting world and, in the process, making their fortunes. They split their enterprise into two distinct firms — one dedicated to domestic Republican political consulting lobbying and the other to lobbying and international political work — and added a new high-profile partner for each. Lee Atwater, the legendary GOP operative who served as Reagan’s deputy campaign manager in 1984, joined the political firm, while Peter Kelly, the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee, joined the lobbying side, which became known as Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.', 'K Street veterans grumbled about the breach in the tradition of lobbying shops identifying exclusively with one party or the other. But Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly — headquartered with Black, Manafort, Stone and Atwater in a brick building overlooking the Potomac River in the historic Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia — quickly redefined the influence industry.', 'It began vacuuming up clients attracted by its growing stable of well-connected Republican and Democratic lobbyists lured to the firm by gaudy salaries from prominent congressional or executive branch posts.

In 1986, the two firms — Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, and Black, Manafort, Stone and Atwater — combined with Manafort personally to collect $2.4 million from international clients, according to ', ' under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.', '\n                            Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Lee Atwater, young Republicans political operatives, pose for a Washington Post photograph in 1985. | Getty Images', 'Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly’s pitch to win the business from the ruling party of the Bahamas, which at the time was being accused of ties to drug trafficking, spelled out the approach of its principals. The firm’s relationships with State Department officials could be “utilized to upgrade a backchannel relationship in the economic and foreign policy spheres,” according to a portion of the pitch ', ' in 1986.', 'One of the firm’s associates, Riva Levinson, who worked under Manafort on the Philippines account, recalled that he was not impressed when she informed him that she had to believe in what she was doing. Manafort predicted that “will be my downfall in this business,” she recalled ', ', published this month. She wrote that a running joke inside the firm was that its work was “like playing one big game of Stratego: building armies and scheming to take over the world. That is exactly what it feels like working with Manafort. In fact, at times, that is exactly what is going on.”', 'Peter Kelly, the Democratic partner in the firm, said Manafort was attracted to trappings of wealth and cultivated an aura of an international jet-setter. He would disappear for days or even weeks without telling people at the firm where he was going or what he was doing and would return to submit expenses including Concorde flights to Paris and bills for stays in a suite at the extravagant Hotel de Crillon, according to Kelly and other former employees at the firm.', 'According to interviews and property records, Manafort drove a top-of-line Mercedes sedan and has purchased, built or rented pricey estates in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia; Palm Beach, Florida and the Hamptons, as well a horse farm in Virginia and a condo in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, where his new boss’ campaign headquarters are located. Several former colleagues and associates recall Manafort boasting about paying to relocate the swimming pool outside the home he built in Mount Vernon because he didn’t like the shade/sun balance, but a former Manafort neighbor told POLITICO it was because the pool was causing problems with the home’s foundation as it settled.', 'Manafort has told associates that he’s not drawing a salary from Trump’s campaign, and there don’t appear to be any payments to him in the campaign’s ', ', leading multiple operatives in and around Trump’s campaign to speculate that Manafort is positioning himself to receive a cut from ad buys, polling or other contract work. Manafort rejected that speculation. “No, no, no, no. I’m a volunteer. I’m at a point in my life where I can volunteer my time,” he told POLITICO.', 'Kelly, in an interview, said Manafort’s driving motivation always seemed to be “to be in the middle of the action. He loved the action. I think that’s what gets him off more than anything. At a certain point, money becomes irrelevant.”', 'Manafort brushed aside questions that he misled his partners, suggesting that politics was motivating the criticism from Kelly, who was a top adviser to Bill Clinton’s presidential campaigns. “Peter Kelly was the only Democrat in the firm at that time, so guess what? He has a vested interest in helping Hillary right now,” said Manafort. “That’s all. He’s playing a game.”', 'But Kelly wasn’t the only former colleague who expressed misgivings about Manafort’s behavior to POLITICO. And Kelly said Manafort sometimes failed to alert the firm of what he was up to, accepting gigs with authoritarian regimes with which some other firm officials felt uncomfortable.', '“Paul did a lot of vile things that weren’t appropriate for a firm like ours. We represented 11 Fortune 500 companies, so we didn’t need them worrying about some deals he was making in Paris,” Kelly said. “There was so much of his business that we didn’t know about.”', 'That included Manafort’s courtship of — and contract with — Marcos, according to Kelly, who said he had to abruptly resign from an election observation mission in the country after learning that his firm was working for Marcos.', 'It’s unclear when precisely Manafort first began working with Marcos, but multiple Black Manafort officials said the relationship started before 1985', ' Manafort himself said he had “no idea” when he first connected with Marcos, but emphasized that he followed all disclosure rules.', 'The Philippine strongman was in dire need of help in Washington after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino, Jr., who was Corazon Aquino’s husband. Marcos started taking heat from Congress and even the administration, despite the deep ties he and his wife had cultivated to Ronald and Nancy Reagan, whom the Marcoses had befriended as far back as 1969, when the Reagans attended a Manila gala marking the opening of a lavish cultural center. Ronald Reagan reportedly twirled Imelda Marcos around the dance floor at the gala. The couples remained close, and Philippine investigators later found records indicating that Imelda Marcos gave then-first lady Nancy Reagan a $60,000 “', ',” which Reagan would have been barred from keeping and which the White House said she never received.', '“There were congressional hearings at least once a month on the Philippines, and there was talk of withholding aid,” said John F. Maisto, an American diplomat who served as the State Department’s director of Philippine affairs during Marcos decline and fall. “Hell, I was on the Hill arguing for the State Department that we should withhold military and even economic assistance from the Philippines in order to pressure them to put the regime back on a democratic path.

The Philippine official who executed the contract was a key Marcos’ ally named Ronaldo “Ronny” Zamora, who would resurface later as a key player in the mystery of the missing millions.', 'According to Bonner’s book, the month before the contract was officially executed, first lady Imelda Marcos personally delivered the first $60,000 of what was intended to be a $950,000 contract during a visit to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly (where she ironically decried “injustice, intolerance, greed and ', '”).', 'Shortly after her speech, her husband, in a dramatic effort to prove he was not anti-democratic, announced in an appearance on ABC’s ""This Week with David Brinkley,"" that he would call for a snap election with more than one year left in his term.', 'Manafort revved into high gear, laying the groundwork for the Philippine foreign minister, Pacifico Castro, to visit the United States for three days to try to meet with U.S. officials, according to Justice Department documents and news accounts. He made plans for three prominent American conservative journalists—Robert Novak, John McLaughlin, and Fred Barnes—to visit the Philippines, according to Bonner’s book. And he worked to seed the idea in Washington conservative circles that Aquino, Marcos’s leading rival in the impending election, was soft on communism and would not be a reliable U.S. ally, according to the book.', 'Then, as the election approached, Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly stepped up its lobbying contacts of influential congressional and State Department officials, according to the firm’s ', ' with the Justice Department.

That cash, as well as $75,000 in donations slated for congressional and local candidates between 1979 and 1982, was to have come from a San Francisco-based company that was linked to a Philippine intelligence fund, the ledger suggests. POLITICO was unable to reach the Marcos associate who administered the company, an American citizen who donated tens of thousands of dollars to U.S. campaigns that he claimed came from his own funds.', 'Another document — a letter from to Marcos from a senior aide that was obtained when his opponents ransacked his files — seems to refer to accounts set up for Reagan and his 1980 campaign manager, the late William J.

The letter was delivered to the Philippine commission that investigated Marcos’ plunder of public resources, the Presidential Commission on Good Government, by a former banker named Antonio Gatmaitan in the days after Marcos stepped down.', 'In an interview, Gatmaitan stood by the claims in the letter, and questioned the degree to which they were investigated by the PCGG, which itself has been the target of ', ', even as it’s recovered an estimated $3.6 billion in Marcos’ assets.', '“I don’t believe that they took it seriously, because Marcos was gone already by that time,” he said. “That’s typical here.

Amurao, the acting chairman of the PCGG, said he couldn’t find the letter from the anonymous bankers, nor any records suggesting that the commission investigated its charges or other evidence that Marcos intended to donate to U.S. campaigns.', '“Somehow our agency … did not look into the matter you were referring,” he wrote in an email to POLITICO. He declined an interview request, pointing out that his term expires at the end of this month, when the incoming presidential administration gets to appoint new commissioners. “Our time now is consumed by the transition work we need to hand over to the incoming administration,” he wrote.', 'But Philippine observers wonder whether the PCGG and its hunt for Marcos’ loot ', ', given the fading memories of the Marcos clan’s plunder and their ', '.

It’s unclear whether U.S. authorities ever obtained or looked into Gatmaitan’s letter. And the U.S. Justice Department declined to investigate the ledger detailing donations made between 1979 and 1982. That’s because, by the time U.S. Customs officials obtained the ledger in 1986, the three-year statute of limitations for prosecuting federal election law violations had passed.

Among those in attendance was Ronny Zamora, the former Marcos lawyer who had signed the contract with Black Manafort years earlier. According to multiple sources, Zamora had been among a group of Marcos confidants who helped the dictator move and invest the billions that he plundered from the public trough, with some of the so-called “Marcos cronies” becoming quite wealthy themselves.', 'Bob Rich, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, said Zamora “was one of the cronies who we felt was handling some of the money, but it wasn’t an official position.” Rich later accompanied the Marcoses during their exile in Hawaii, overseeing the logistics around their accommodations and the two planeloads of possessions they brought with them. He said the U.S. had a tough time tracking the flow of cash around Marcos and his cronies, explaining “we didn’t always know where the money was coming from.”', 'Like most Marcos cronies, Zamora did not face legal charges and later reemerged in Philippine politics backing other parties — in Zamora’s case, Aquino’s.', 'At the dinner, Zamora boasted that he provided $10 million in cash from Marcos to Manafort to donate to Reagan’s campaign, two attendees told POLITICO.', '\n                            In demonstrations on February 2, 1986, anti-Marcos protesters carry a box containing the caricatured heads of President Ronald Reagan and Ferdinand Marcos.

It was a personal gift from Marcos to Reagan.”', 'Rollins in the book recalls being “stunned” by the story. “Not in a state of total disbelief, though, because I knew the lobbyist well and I had no doubt the money was now in some offshore bank,” Rollins wrote, bemoaning “I ran the campaign for $75,000 a year, and this guy got $10 million in cash.”', 'Rollins, who is now running a super PAC supporting Trump, said in an interview with POLITICO that, as soon as he got back to Washington, he asked Bay Buchanan, who served as treasurer of all three of Reagan’s presidential campaigns, whether there was any chance that foreign money had made its way into the campaign’s coffers. “Absolutely not,” Rollins recalls her saying. (Buchanan says she doesn’t recall this conversation).', 'Later, according to Rollins’ book, he shared the story with Laxalt, a close friend. Laxalt immediately responded “Christ, now it all makes sense,” according to Rollins’ book, which quotes Laxalt’s recollection of his October 1985 meeting with Marcos at which he recommended the dictator hire Manafort, but also passed along Reagan’s message of the importance of reform.', '“When I was over there cutting off Marcos’ nuts, he gave me a hard time. ‘How can you do this?’ he kept saying to me. ‘I gave Reagan $10 million. How can he do this to me?’ ” Laxalt said, according to Rollins’s book. “I didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Now I get it.”', 'Two GOP operatives told POLITICO that when Rollins’ book came out in 1996, he told them that the lobbyist in question was Manafort. Some Republicans familiar with the book attributed the passage in the book to tension between Rollins and Manafort, who were both considered contenders for the position of Reagan’s reelection campaign manager, which Rollins ultimately got. Rollins dismissed the idea that he has any bad blood with Manafort. (The two men are ostensibly on the same team now, though Manafort’s allies have tried to ', '’ super PAC, and to a new super PAC run by a former associate at Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.)', 'The operatives who discussed the Manila dinner anecdote with Rollins said he told them he had withheld Manafort’s name from his book out of concern for then-U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, who was the GOP nominee for president and for whom Manafort was working at the time.', 'Rollins would not confirm or deny those conversations, but he told POLITICO that when the book came out, “every reporter in the world” chased the story. “Several had come to me and said, ‘I know it was Manafort.’ And I said ‘I’m not confirming it.’“', 'Manafort called the story “totally fiction,” asserting “there never was any $10 million. … He made it up.”', 'Charlie Black, Manafort’s lobbying partner, said of the book: “I don’t know where Ed would have gotten that,” adding “I’m pretty confident Paul wasn’t involved in any of that. Paul is a lawyer, so he would have known it was illegal. Plus, he has more integrity than that.” And he said “$10 million was a lot of money in those days and if it had happened, I don’t think we would have seen hide nor hair of Paul again.”', 'In fact, Black said he and Manafort discussed the book when it came out, since it seemed obvious to informed readers that Manafort was the undisclosed lobbyist. But Black said “Paul didn’t sound like he was losing any sleep over it.”', 'As for Zamora, who returned to the Philippine congress after being term-limited out in 2010, he rejected Rollins’ account. “I certainly didn’t do anything like that,” he proclaimed, when reached by phone this month. He asserted he’d never met Manafort and added “I’m not even sure that I had that dinner” with Rollins.', 'Zamora said he and Marcos “never even talked about donating to any presidential campaign.” Pointing out that Marcos also was a lawyer (he boasted of receiving a near-perfect score of 98.8 percent on his bar exam, though that was later disputed), Zamora said Marcos “was careful about complying with election laws, especially American election laws, because you are even more strict than we are.”', 'Besides, Zamora added with bemusement, “How do you carry $10 million in cash? You know, not to sound too familiar with United States currency, but your currency is a little difficult to carry in cash.” Off the top of his head, he calculated that $10 million in $100 bills must weigh “a couple hundred pounds.” (The precise weight is 220 pounds, according to a ', ')', 'Zamora did acknowledge signing a contract with Manafort’s firm on behalf of The Chamber of Philippine Manufacturers, Exporters & Tourism Associations. But he said he only did so at the request of Marcos’s late brother-in-law Benjamin Trinidad Romualdez. “He was the one who asked me to sign for the group of the president,” said Zamora, professing ignorance to Black Manafort’s work or anything about the contract beyond the fact that he signed it.', '“That’s all that I did, which of course, under American law is more than enough … to get you liable if something comes up,” he said. “But you know after that, remember, we had lost. We were all kicked out, and I never heard anything about this until – well, until now.”', '***', ', told POLITICO that the two discussed Manafort’s work with Marcos and the mystery of the campaign-donation-that-wasn’t for years afterward, but that Laxalt “never wanted to get involved in that because of his own relationships there.”', 'Laxalt is 93 and in declining health, but his daughter Michelle Laxalt, who worked for Reagan during his campaigns and in his administration on foreign policy issues, says her father occasionally speculated about what happened to Marcos’ campaign cash.', '“The rumor about the case of the missing Manila millions was clearly a part of the chatter I was intrigued to listen to Ed and dad most closely to,” she told POLITICO, adding that she also “had heard rumblings in certain circles” beyond her father and Rollins. She stressed, though, that she never heard Manafort’s name in connection with that chatter, and didn’t think her father had either, though that conflicts with the recollection of Rollins.', 'It’s theoretically possible that Marcos’ money could have made its way into an independent group supporting Reagan’s campaign, said Reagan’s treasurer Buchanan. But she added that there was never any evidence of any outside group spending big money supporting Reagan.', 'And she stressed that there was absolutely no way that any foreign money made it by her staff, and into the campaign, itself.', '“Watergate made a very strong impression on me,” said Buchanan, whose older brother Pat Buchanan worked for Richard Nixon during the Watergate break-in scandal, which also involved illegal campaign contributions. Pat Buchanan was ', ' by the scandal, but his sister said the experience made her doubly diligent about adhering to campaign finance rules.', '“I made copies of every single check that was deposited in our account, because we took matching funds in the primary, so we had a 100 percent federal audit. And, in the general, we took the money from the federal government, so we didn’t raise any money at all,” she said, referring to a ', ' that provided taxpayer money for presidential campaigns that agreed to spending restrictions.', 'Even if Reagan’s campaign had wanted to accept a huge lump sum payment from a foreign leader, it would have been immediately flagged as illegal by the Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance laws. And it would have required a massive amount of clerical chicanery to funnel $10 million into a campaign in a manner that evaded detection, since the individual campaign contribution limit for individuals in 1984 was $1,000 — meaning the cash would have had to have been divided into individual donations from at least 10,000 different so-called straw donors.', '“First of all, it would have been illegal,” Buchanan said. “And second, by 1984, it wouldn’t have been necessary, because he was the incumbent president, and we didn’t have any trouble raising money.”', 'By that point, though, Marcos’s political future was almost entirely dependent on keeping Reagan in the White House and on his side, especially after his Democratic general election opponent, Walter Mondale, came out against Marcos during the 1984 campaign.', 'So an under-the-table financial contribution might have made sense to him, said the American diplomat Maisto.', '“Politically speaking, that’s the way Marcos thought back then. He had all the money in the world, and he knew the American political system functioned on contributions, not unlike the Philippine oligarchy,” said Maisto. “He thought that his ace in the hole was Ronald Reagan, and he didn’t want Reagan to leave the White House, so it makes that he would do whatever he could to ensure that Ronald Reagan was reelected.”', '***', '.', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                    Updated ', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                                ', ' © 2019 POLITICO LLC']"

Mitt Romney were the more enthusiastic and motivated group.', 'That phenomenon was clearly on display when a number of national pollsters began screening for likely voters in August and September 2012.

Unfortunately, there is little in the short term we can do about that.” ', ' The 2010 midterm elections, when the tea party wave helped Republicans recapture the House of Representatives, was the first in which the Kochs and their allies spent heavily through non-profit groups in the network and others allied with it.

', ' At a 2015 network gathering in Washington, D.C., Charles Koch’s right-hand man Rich Fink told staffers that Koch, who will turn 81 next month, intended to leave a significant portion of his fortune, currently estimated at $42.2 billion, to the network when he dies, according to two people who were present at the meeting. (It’s unclear how that cash would be allocated, but Charles Koch’s donations to the network have mostly gone towards academic research, think tanks and higher education programs, rather than politics, according to campaign finance filings and interviews with people familiar with his giving).

And, while sources say Charles Koch and his top lieutenants debated proposals to spend tens of millions of dollars to try to stop Trump, they ultimately decided against it. ', 'In March, as Trump racked up a string of impressive primary victories that marked him as the prohibitive favorite to win the nomination, word began circulating in conservative circles that the Koch network was starting to shift its spending away from campaigns and more towards academic research and think tanks. When POLITICO asked a handful of network sources about the possible shift, a network official proactively reached out to claim that it was “completely wrong."" The swift preemptive pushback suggested that the network was acutely sensitive to any perception of such a shift, which could have the effect of dampening donor enthusiasm in an election year.

Two days after the article’s publication, Adams was gone, according to an autoreply message from his email account saying he was “no longer employed at Freedom Partners.” Sources say there was gossip among Freedom Partners staff about the possibility of legal action against Adams, who did not respond to inquiries from POLITICO.

It said that the ads were evidence that it was “ ', '” in 2016 politics, even if it wasn’t playing in the presidential race.

', ' Under the ', ' game, not only would the network refrain from television advertising after Oct. 4, but it also would cancel a week of advertising it had reserved in late September and early October to support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s reelection campaign. Davis explained the decision by pointing to Rubio’s large lead over his Democratic challenger, and noting that groups supporting the Democrat also pulled their advertising in the state.

And the group stopped aggressive fundraising for its super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, in recent months, reflecting the shift away from television advertising. The PAC, which had raised $8.1 million in May alone, has raised only $6.7 million in the four months since then, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. ', ' Donors who had collectively given tens of millions of dollars to the Koch network began pulling back or redirecting their contributions to other, often newer, big-money vehicles that were spending in the presidential race. ', ' Mega-rich conservative families that had been Koch donors — including the Mercers (who had pledged $25 million from their hedge fund fortune to the Koch network one year, according to sources familiar with it) and the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family — assumed control of their own super PACs or non-profit groups to boost Trump or attack his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

', ' Holden conceded “we’re not engaged in the presidential election, and when you’re not engaged in the presidential, that’s a big chunk of cash that you’re missing, for sure.” ', 'But a handful of major donors and fundraisers who have worked with the Koch network predicted that some benefactors who turned away from the network may not be so eager to come back, partly because other big-money operations offer them more say in choosing issues, campaigns and tactics. ', ' Indeed, as the Koch network has expanded the range of policy areas in which it’s active, it has irked some of its donor constituencies who agree with the Kochs’ animating issue — fiscal conservatism — but disagree with the brothers on other issues.

', ' But perhaps the biggest feature of the reorganization is the contraction that was initiated when AFP absorbed a trio of smaller groups targeting specific slices of the electorate — Generation Opportunity (which is focused on millennials), the LIBRE Initiative (Hispanics) and Concerned Veterans for America (veterans and national security voters). ', ' At the same time, operatives familiar with the situation tell POLITICO, the network has largely terminated its relationships with and payments to a pair of groups that were deemed unsuccessful or ill-fitting within the network — a ', ' called Aegis Strategic, and a religious-themed non-profit called the Institute for Faith, Work & Economics. ', ' The tumult — combined with a handful of high-profile departures and widespread concerns that the network could find itself facing congressional investigations if Democrats retake the Senate — has some employees on edge, according to a handful of people around the network. ', ' It was against that backdrop that staffers were summoned to the Charles Koch Institute’s auditorium on the rainy September Monday morning. ', ' After Holden’s presentation about the reorganization, a pair of other network officials talked about the importance of destroying old physical and electronic files. ', ' Earlier in the month, the network held a document clean-up and retention week during which shredding bins were brought to the offices of various network groups, and employees were encouraged to identify sensitive files for destruction. Since there is no evidence of any active investigation into the Koch network, there’s nothing prohibiting the groups from destroying old files — a security safeguard that’s becoming more common in politics and business as ', ' and cyber-attacks.

At the tail end of it, Holden predicted that Republicans had a 60 percent chance of keeping the Senate, while Michael Palmer, the head of the network-owned data company i360, predicted the party’s prospects of retaining control of the upper chamber were 40 percent.

', ' The proposal to Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan was straightforward: retract critical statements he made to a reporter in return for Wasserman Schultz publicly backing his cannabis initiative that she had trashed just months earlier. Morgan declined the offer with a sharp email reply sent to a go-between, who described the congresswoman as being in a “tizzy.” ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “No,” Morgan responded. “She is a bully. I beat bullies up for a living.” ', ' Wasserman Schultz declined to comment. ', ' Morgan said he forwarded the email chain to POLITICO on Thursday to show how “thin-skinned” and transactional Wasserman Schultz’s political team is, he said in a brief phone conversation. ', ' The bad blood between Morgan and Wasserman Schultz — which stems from her critical comments over the medical-marijuana initiative he bankrolled last year, and which failed narrowly — boiled over again this week when Democrats started buzzing about her interest in running for Senate if Republican Marco Rubio decides to leave the seat for a presidential bid. ', ' Morgan and three medical-marijuana advocacy organizations blasted the South Florida representative for her criticisms of his 2014 initiative. It fell 2.4 percentage points shy of the needed 60 percent voter-approval threshold for a Florida constitutional amendment. ', ' “Almost 58 percent of Florida voters supported medical marijuana and I’d be surprised if that many support her,” said Bill Piper, national affairs director with the Washington-based Drug Policy Alliance. ', ' “That should be a lesson for Debbie Wasserman Schultz,” he said. “Florida voters like this policy more than her. And we’ll make sure people know her position.” ', ' Still, Wasserman Schultz is a nationally known figure, a good fundraiser and would be an early favorite to win a Democratic primary, political observers say. ', ' The most likely Democrat to run for Rubio’s seat, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a centrist voting record that could leave him vulnerable in a primary but strong in a general election. The more liberal Wasserman Schultz has the opposite problem. And, unlike Murphy, she has had bad relations with numerous Democratic insiders. ', ' Morgan plans to get the proposed marijuana amendment on the ballot again in 2016, making it a top campaign issue in the presidential election in Florida, the nation’s most-populous swing state. ', ' The clash with Morgan began in June when Wasserman Schultz issued a rare public statement criticizing the medical-marijuana initiative he helped draft, and to which he committed $4 million of his own money to pass. ', ' Echoing Republican talking points, Wasserman Schultz suggested the proposal could lead to a variant of OxyContin-distributing “pill mills.” Wasserman Schultz has previously expressed concerns, as a parent, about marijuana decriminalization because she doesn’t want to make it easier for kids to get the drug. ', ' At the time, Morgan blasted Wasserman Schultz, calling her “despised…an irritant…irrelevant.” ', ' Wasserman Schultz responded by having her staff call around to drum up statements of support from other Democrats, including then-Democratic candidate for governor Charlie Crist, who works at Morgan’s law firm, knowledgeable sources say. The Wasserman Schultz effort culminated in a tense speaker-phone call with Crist’s campaign staffers, who were interrupted during a TV commercial shoot. ', ' The congresswoman’s more recent dispute with Morgan unfolded Wednesday afternoon. POLITICO sent an email at 3:50 p.m. to Wasserman Schultz’s office seeking comment on criticisms from Morgan and other medical marijuana advocates. Three minutes later, an adviser replied that she had no comment. ', ' In the meantime, Wasserman Schultz’s office sprung into action. Her team reached out to the campaign manager for the medical marijuana initiative — Ben Pollara, a top Democratic fundraiser and consultant in Miami — and offered him a deal. ', ' Pollara, who refused to comment, detailed the offer in an email to Morgan a few hours later, the donor said, with the subject line: “DWS.” ', ' “In a tizzy over this politico story. Saying she might be willing to support new amendment. Any chance you’ll retract your statement,” Pollara wrote.

And because I have clients who are willing to pay the premium that it takes to do it this way, I’ve not had to cut corners.” ', 'The recent track record of her firm, Selzer & Company, is impressive: Selzer, who has polled for the Des Moines Register for decades, was the only pollster to ', ' of Democratic candidates in 2004. ', ' before the 2008 caucuses accurately predicted that a surge of first-time caucusgoers would propel Barack Obama to a decisive victory. ', ' former Pennsylvania Sen.

', '“It is an honor, but I’m also not so modest that I wouldn’t say it’s earned,” she said. “We have a very good track record, and it’s not just in Iowa.” ', 'Selzer’s sterling reputation raises the stakes for the new poll on Saturday. Already, GOP front-runner Donald Trump is pre-butting the poll, ', "" Friday afternoon: “Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.” "", 'A solid standing in Selzer’s poll can lead a candidate into the holidays with a tailwind in Iowa. Her final poll in 2012 established Santorum as a viable winner in the hours leading up the caucuses. ', 'A disappointing showing, on the other hand, can stunt a campaign’s momentum, especially with donors in the last two weeks of the fundraising year. ', 'Selzer’s successes have come as other public election pollsters have missed key races. The polls underestimated Obama in 2012. (Selzer ', ' that one in Iowa, too, incidentally.) They swung the other way in 2014, misjudging the breadth of the Republican wave. And 2015 hasn’t been a banner year, either, with both public and private polling failing to account for the margin of Kentucky Gov.-elect Matt Bevin’s victory last month — or conservative victories abroad in the United Kingdom or Israel. ', 'For Selzer, part of not “cutting corners” means live interviewers calling voters on landlines and cell phones. While she’s looked at conducting polls online, she worries that — since a pollster can’t randomly contact people via email — only surveying voters who opt into the poll skews the results. ', '\n                    ', '\n                    By HADAS GOLD and GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI', '“There’s no repository of all the email addresses that are out there,” she said. “Some have three, some have 13, so there’s no way that you can ensure that every person has an equal chance to be contacted. And then in the end you’re dealing with volunteers.” ', 'But it’s also how she obtains the pool of voters from which she randomly selects her sample that differs from other public, telephone pollsters. It’s a major conundrum for many pollsters — how to reflect a low-participation electorate in a presidential caucus. Only 121,000 people participated in the GOP caucuses in 2012 — fewer than 6 percent of the total number of registered voters, and fewer than one-in-five registered Republicans, in the state. ', 'Some pollsters, like ', ' to which Trump referred, randomly call Iowa phone numbers and ask respondents if they’re registered to vote and whether they intend to go to a caucus site. Others, like ', ', have used a tighter screen — only calling those voters who participated in recent primary elections. (Though Monmouth recently expanded its screen to include a minority of people who haven’t participated in past nominating contests.) ', 'Selzer views the CNN poll as too broad, and the Monmouth method — which is shared by some political campaigns — as a methodological shortcut. Calling only or mostly frequent primary voters is too restrictive, Selzer warns, and compromises the sample in order to cut costs, since pollsters are calling only people who have demonstrated past voting behavior. ', '“Caucuses are a low-incidence event,” Selzer explained. “So if you start with a narrower universe, where the incidence is higher proportionately [among] people who’ve voted in Republican primaries before, your incidence is going to go up to 25, 30, maybe 40 percent. You’re hanging up on fewer people. It’s cheaper to do.” ', 'Selzer, however, uses a list of all registered voters, but she lets those voters tell her whether they intend to caucus. ', 'It’s a technique that she says has served her well in past cycles, even as some critics say the polls are including too many people who say they intend to caucus but never have before — groups that could favor candidates like Trump, and on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. ', '“I’ve had the experience that would change anybody. In 2008, our final poll said 60 percent of people on the Democratic side were going to be first-time caucusgoers,” Selzer said. “And we took a lot of heat, and people cried and they carried on. [PBS anchor] Judy Woodruff was interviewing me that day and said, ‘How did you assume this? Why did you assume this?’ I go, ‘I assumed ', '.’ My data told me this was what was going to happen, and it was 57 percent in the ', '.” ', 'It’s too early to tell, Selzer said, whether the intense interest in the Republican field — record ratings for the GOP televised debates, for example — mean that turnout at the caucuses will surge as well. ', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', 'Selzer said Iowa pollsters face the same problems as others around the country. Nearly half of U.S. adults don’t own a landline telephone, and fewer people than ever want to participate in phone polls even when they are reached. That’s made polling more expensive — prohibitively expensive for some of the other media outlets outside Iowa for which Selzer has polled in the past — and raised questions about obtaining accurate results. ', 'But there’s another problem unique to Iowa — one specifically related to Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucus status. ', '“The tricky thing in Iowa is there is no state that is more polled,” Selzer said. “So the problem I worry about, there’s not anything I can do about it, is respondent wear-out.” ', 'Saturday’s poll won’t be the survey against which Selzer is judged — that will come in late January, right before the Feb. 1 caucuses. And while she urges observers to look beyond the horse-race numbers at other questions that reveal what’s driving voters’ decisions, she acknowledges that “the horse race is always going to be the most important thing. The most important thing you can do is win. Iowa happens to be the place you can do it first.” ', 'And before candidates and pundits celebrate or fret about their standing in the new survey, Selzer reminded POLITICO that late momentum can, and often does, carry an unexpected candidate over the finish line. ', '“There are the reporters who say, ‘Does this predict what’s going to happen?’ Which, to me, just sounds silly. If I were to say yes, then we would just stop polling,” said Selzer. “We do expect things to change. The candidates are spending time and lots of money to make things change.” ', '“There really is no playbook beyond what I think is terribly important, which is: Get hot at the end,” Selzer added. ', 'Selzer declined last month to speculate which candidates were best positioned to surge in the waning weeks of the race. But she hopes — despite all of the negative trends for predictive public polling — she’ll see it coming. ', '“When I go to bed the night before caucus, I think, ‘There’s nothing I regret. There isn’t something I could have done that I should have done,’” said Selzer. “So we may not get it right the next time, but I’ve said that the last several elections because it is getting harder.

Admittedly the Republicans have a lot of problems with their candidates who are members of the slave- and serf- owning classes, but we worry nevertheless that one of them will become the next president,” he said. “I would like to see an alternative to Hillary who was popular, populist, wanted to run, electable, not too old and could raise money.” ', ' The predicament in which the party finds itself as it nears the sunset of the Obama era was laid out in stark terms in the recent Democratic National Committee “autopsy” report, which emphasized the need to build a strong party bench in the wake of sweeping electoral losses in 2014 from state houses to governors’ mansions, to the Senate, and a broader hollowing out of the party infrastructure since Obama’s election in 2008. The party’s lack of depth at the national level is reflected in the flimsy emerging presidential field beyond the Clinton juggernaut, despite some activists’ attempts to encourage popular figures to jump in the race to ensure Clinton is battle-tested before the general election. ', ' It’s a sign of Clinton’s strength that none of the influential Democrats POLITICO surveyed on Wednesday or Thursday indicated that the email news would alone be enough to turn them away from Clinton entirely. The former senator and First Lady’s allies have worked overtime to insist that the email flap is unimportant to Americans themselves. ', ' “Voters do not give a shit. They do not even give a fart,” said longtime Clinton ally and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, echoing the sentiments of most Clinton allies who believe the all-but-certain nominee is enough of a defined quantity in voters’ eyes that Republican attacks on her email policies cannot sway them — especially not over a year-and-a-half before she faces a competitive vote. ', ' “Find me one persuadable voter who agrees with HRC on the issues but will vote against her because she has a non-archival-compliant email system and I’ll kiss your ass in Macy’s window and say it smells like roses,” he said. ', ' Other Democrats were more measured, insisting that the news was worrisome and that the party should field more presidential contenders in case Clinton struggles in a serious way. But most kept their criticisms to a minimum, and just one early-state figure reported hearing from any of the other potential candidates since the news broke on Monday night. ', ' Some of Clinton’s financial backers are scratching their heads as the story has spiraled into a major point of conversation on cable news and radio, questioning the turbulent home-stretch of Clinton’s pre-campaign phase. ', ' One Democratic donor told POLITICO on Wednesday that Clinton’s last few days have caused concern in New York’s influential donor community. But most of her high-level donors have stood staunchly by her side, and Clinton had a chance to speak with many of her backers on Wednesday night as she headlined the Clinton Foundation’s annual gala — which cost between $2,500 and $100,000 to attend — in Manhattan’s financial district. ', ' After disappointing several supporters by not addressing the swirling controversies during a Tuesday appearance in Washington, Clinton on Thursday added a Saturday stop in Miami to her schedule — a stop where many Clinton-watchers expect her to comment on the news. ', ' Announced just hours after Clinton tweeted that she had asked the State Department to release her emails after reviewing them, the appearance will be at an event that was originally supposed to be hosted just by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. ', ' After her stop in Miami, Clinton will return to New York for a pair of major events where she will unveil her much-anticipated report on the status of women and girls worldwide, alongside a slate of high-profile women. ', ' Clinton’s recent stumbles, however, have served as a reminder of her struggles during her summer 2014 book tour, despite the carefully designed sprint through March. ', ' “There is some concern. Some people are saying, ‘Is this going to blow up in her face?,’” said Jack Hatch, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Iowa governor in 2014. ', ' Others see the ongoing questions as an indication that Clinton has to better manage her public image in the weeks before she officially announces her candidacy, if Democrats are going to win the White House. ', ' “This is a signal, it’s a warning, that whatever [else] there may be … get it straight, be prepared to be open with it, above board,” said former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, noting that at a moment of deep public distrust of the government, the last thing Clinton needs is to come across as secretive. “She can’t afford to give any impression that, ‘This is the way it’s going to be from the start of my campaign, or from my government.’ I think they’re aware of that.” ', ' The general trust in Clinton’s ability to handle the situation is not universal, however. At least one outspoken Democratic activist who has a bad history with the Clintons seized upon the news to insist that others jump in the race. ', ' “Her [potential] campaign is so disdainful of anybody who raises any issues,” said former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Dick Harpootlian, a long-standing booster of Vice President Joe Biden. “You need to get out ahead of it. How does she not see that one coming?” ', ' Biden has raised some eyebrows by appearing in New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina in recent weeks on official White House business, but the vast majority of Democrats concede it is highly unlikely that the 72-year-old vice president throws his hat in the ring. ', ' Few of Clinton’s possible rivals have spent much time in the early states this year, though former Maryland Governor O’Malley has been ramping up his travel after subtly jabbing at Clinton during a stop in South Carolina last weekend. ', ' But O’Malley is not expected to weigh in on the email saga before the weekend, and even his friends in early states say the controversy is overblown. ', ' “I’ve seen it in the news. My wife and I have sat together to watch it on the news, and we have not said a word to each other about it. I’ve had no one — what’s it been out, three days? — not one person has said a thing. Family, friends, people I’ve run into, not one person has brought it up as a topic,” said O’Malley friend Dan O’Neil, an alderman in Manchester, N.H. ', ' O’Malley is set to appear in New Hampshire and Kansas this weekend before a speaking engagement in Washington next week and a swing through Iowa later this month. And former Virginia Sen. James Webb formed an exploratory committee in November, but he has been largely quiet since then, despite scheduling one Iowa appearance for late March. ', ' Craig Crawford, Webb’s spokesman, said he doesn’t think voters care about Clinton’s emails. “They’d rather all be talking about jobs and the economy and how working people can get a leg up when wages are falling and income at the top is growing,” he said. ', ' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist who is technically an Independent, continues to waffle over running. And the groups backing a run by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she won’t run, are unlikely to weigh in on anything Clinton does as they stick to positive messaging and work to organize in Iowa and New Hampshire for Warren. ', ' But while Republicans and reporters continue to dig into Clinton’s email practices, a mix of concerned resignation and urgency has settled in among Democrats involved in the nominating process. ', ' “It may continue to haunt her,” said Mary Hoyer, chair of Iowa’s Henry County Democrats, in an email. “She has to go on the offensive and find her message or she will never overcome these ‘paper cuts.’” ', ' ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Cochran for being as desperate as he was, to actually go out and, up front, go out and ask for those votes,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). “Those votes were delivered, and I’m hopeful he will be responsible and responsive to the voters that pushed him over the top.” ', ' Rep.

', ' Their sentiment was echoed around the Capitol and in Mississippi following Cochran’s win over tea party favorite Chris McDaniel, fueled by a surge in black voters in the Mississippi Delta. Turnout increased overall in Mississippi for the runoff, but counties that are majority black, like Jefferson County, saw voters came to the polls in record numbers. ', ' Cochran isn’t expected to draw a huge black vote in November for the general election, but blacks still want him to remember his primary campaign promise to use his seniority to help his poor black constituents. ', ' “Mississippi is the poorest state in the union,” said Fudge. “I think he is a very decent man. I also think there comes a point in time where every single elected official has to do what’s best for the people he represents, and his state is 35 percent minority and poor.” ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Cochran’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Flaggs said he will support Cochran in the general election and that it is important he stays in office so that Mississippi can benefit from his longevity in Congress, particularly since earmarks are gone. ', ' NAACP Mississippi state President Derrick Johnson said in an interview that the NAACP is looking for Cochran’s support. ', ' “Two things that we think should come immediately after the election [are] his support of the Voting Rights Act … free of any provisions that would allow for voter ID and, second, to get the presidents of the black colleges to ask for his offices for help to make sure the [missions] of those institutions are carried out,” he said.

', ' “In the case of yesterday’s election, we must be absolutely certain that our Republican primary was won by Republican voters,” McDaniel said in a statement Wednesday. “In the coming days, our team will look into the irregularities to determine whether a challenge is warranted.” ', ' Some McDaniel supporters have questioned the results and are advocating a write-in campaign for the general election.

Bennie Thompson said that he was the better alternative. ', ' “Thad Cochran represented an opportunity to vote against times past,” the Mississippi Democrat said. “I think what McDaniel represented to a lot of black people who observed the race is a time past.

Niederauer in 2009.', 'NEW YORK — Wall Street has a message for bank-bashing U.S. populist politicians: Put down the pitchforks or you could end up like Ed Miliband. ', ' Senior financial executives say the Labour leader’s anti-bank, soak the rich rhetoric helped sink his party in the United Kingdom elections and assure a surprisingly big reelection win for Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative Party last week. Miliband resigned as Labour leader following the loss. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' These bankers and their ideological supporters say if likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton keeps tacking to the left on Wall Street issues — as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, other progressive Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are demanding — she could face the same fate. ', ' “Cameron embraced the role of the financial sector in growing the U.K. economy and creating jobs, never once criticizing hedge funds, banks or the wealthy,” said a top executive at one of Wall Street’s largest firms. “Miliband ran against hedge funds and bankers, promising bonus and mansion taxes and lost big. Is that a lesson for Hillary as well?” ', ' This executive, like several others who cited the U.K. election result as a warning to populists, declined to be identified by name or firm for fear of heavy backlash. ', ' Another executive said Miliband’s adoption of Warren’s approach to the financial sector and banking regulation failed even though U.K. voters trust banks even less than U.S. voters, according to opinion surveys. ', ' It “seems like there might be some political lessons for the U.S. out of the U.K. election — with Miliband’s Warren-style, anti-business, anti-bank rhetoric clearly falling flat with the general public, even as the press ate it up,” this executive from another one of Wall Street’s largest firms said. “And the Edelman trust barometer [a survey that attempts to measure public trust in large institutions] actually shows that British voters are more distrustful and wary of the banks than here in the U.S.” ', ' The financial executives cited Miliband’s attacks on Cameron and the Conservatives as the “party of hedge funds” and his calls for higher taxes on the industry as failing to captivate U.K. voters. And they noted that, despite polls showing a very tight race, Cameron and his party won 51 percent of the seats and 331 seats in Parliament to just 36 percent and 232 seats for Miliband and his Labour Party. ', ' Conservative analysts also said U.S. politicians, including Clinton, should take note of the U.K. result. ', ' “There are two lessons here,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum. “One is the Miliband lesson. The U.S. has now seen that people in the U.K. don’t really like this focus on inequality and redistribution. It’s not where people are. And the second is that conservatives were very effective in saying they were for working people but keeping the focus on work not excessive government intervention and benefits.” ', ' Financial reform advocates in the U.S. say these executives and analysts are reading things into the U.K. results that are not really there. ', ' “Backwards logic like this almost makes you understand why Wall Street executives are deluded enough to believe they shouldn’t be held responsible for blowing up the economy in 2008 and fighting common-sense legislation designed to prevent them from doing it again,” said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America. “If these guys actually believe that Cameron won because he bear-hugged billionaire bankers or think that Democrats will do better in 2016 if they continue treating a thief on Wall Street differently than a thief on Main Street, I’ve got a tranche of decade-old, toxic mortgages I know they’ll want to get in on.” ', ' Dennis Kelleher, head of financial reform group Better Markets, said many other factors were at play in the U.K. ', ' “Claiming the five-week sprint known as the U.K. election — and the Scottish freedom campaign — means anything for the U.S. is nothing more than wishful thinking by Wall Street’s spinners,” he said. Former “Secretary Clinton will be spelling out pro-growth agendas that also protect the American people from Wall Street’s dangerous too big to fail banks. It’s not either/or. It’s both.” ', ' The comments from Wall Street executives and conservative analysts come as some in the industry fear that Clinton will continue to move left on financial reform issues as her campaign progresses. ', ' Clinton used her first trip to Iowa as an announced candidate last month to issue a fresh assault. “There’s something wrong,” she told Iowans, when “hedge fund managers pay lower taxes than nurses or the truckers I saw on I-80 when I was driving here over the last two days.” ', ' In a fundraising note last month, Clinton wrote that “families have fought their way back from tough economic times. But it’s not enough — not when the average CEO makes 300 times what the average worker makes.” ', ' Wall Street mostly shrugged off those comments, confident that Clinton, who has enjoyed heavy financial support from the industry, would ultimately govern as a pro-business pragmatist not inclined to bust up big banks or support higher taxes on financial transactions or new controls on executive pay. ', ' But as the “Draft Warren” for president movement continues to gain steam and coalitions of left-wing and right-wing populists in Congress flirt with the idea of breaking up the biggest banks, Wall Street is getting a bit more nervous. And it is pointing to the U.K. results and Republican gains in 2014 in the U.S. as evidence that Clinton should focus on other issues or face a possible loss in 2016. ', ' “I would say that this is the second major election in a row where bank bashing no longer seems to move voters,” said a lobbyist for the banking industry. “Even where voters may continue to have anger about banks, other issues seem to be driving their votes.

Cory Booker launched a bid for the White House in February on a message of love and unity, painting himself as an inspirational leader who would help a polarized America find common ground. ', ' Just 10 weeks later, Booker is discovering that so far love just isn’t enough. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Polling in the single digits and lagging top-tier competitors in fundraising, Booker this week sought to reboot his campaign, launching a “Justice For All” two-week, national tour heavy on economic policy proposals and social justice messaging. In Iowa, he rolled out an expansive proposal for a new income tax credit and talked about the need for rural infrastructure investment. In Georgia, he unveiled a voting rights plan, vowing to make Election Day a national holiday and talked about restoring voting rights to ex-felons. ', ' The recent steps aim to invigorate a presidential bid that has underwhelmed some Democrats who are questioning whether Booker’s message is one that resonates in the Trump era.', 'Booker kicked off his presidential bid Feb. 1 framing his run on the proposition that the nation’s next leader needed to tap into ways to reunite an ever-divided country. Booker, who often references Martin Luther King Jr., is shaping his candidacy as one that seeks to bring back civic grace and discourse, saying that political tribalism in America runs so deep “we can’t even do the things that we agree on.”', 'The race for 2020 starts now.

', ' It’s a tricky platform to execute, said Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. While he said Booker’s messaging is “compelling,” it comes at a political moment when the party is hungry for candidates to offer up evidence that they can defeat President Donald Trump. ', ' “The Democratic base is angry as hell and we’re fighting for our lives,” Bagniewski said. “That’s how it feels every day. The primary voters are angry and they want to fight.” ', ' At an Iowa town hall this week, one potential caucus-goer commented on Booker’s approach, telling him that “while we love your love message,” tackling issues like climate change “has to be our first priority.”', ' Even the senator acknowledged he’s been second-guessed on his messaging.', ' “‘That’s not a strategy to win, Cory. You’re fighting against Donald Trump. How you gonna to win?’” Booker said people will ask him. “And I say, ‘please, I’m the guy who beat this machine in Newark, New Jersey.’” ', ' Booker told that Iowa crowd he believes the election has to be about something more than just ousting Trump from the White House.

I understand that call, but it’s got to be about something bigger than that,” Booker said. “We Democrats in this room, it can’t just be about beating Republicans, no. This is a moral moment in our country where it’s got to be about uniting Americans.” ', ' A March ', ' in Iowa backs up Booker’s premise: 50 percent of those surveyed said it was “absolutely critical” that a 2020 candidate is “someone who can heal the racial, ethnic and partisan divide in our country.”', "" Still, as he moves into the second quarter of the most crowded and diverse Democratic presidential primary in history, Booker is finding that the skills he's long tapped as an orator with a mayor’s flair for finding human connection so far hasn’t been enough to break through. On top of a slew of other U.S. senators in the race, fresh faces like former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are deploying similar retail traits to dazzle prospective voters. "", 'So far, according to polls, O’Rourke and Buttigieg have ranked above Booker, who also trails top-tier candidates in the race including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.', 'Likewise, Booker’s first-quarter $5 million fundraising haul ranked below most other top-tier Democratic candidates. While his campaign says his polling numbers qualified him for the national debate stage, he’s trailing in the small-dollar fundraising contest that’s reflecting strength in many of his competitors’ campaigns.', '\n                            Cory Booker hauled in $5 million during the first quarter, adding to the $2.7 million he already had in the bank — placing him significantly behind Democratic frontrunners. ', ' With that in mind, Booker has shifted toward a more policy-heavy agenda in his two-week tour across the country that will take him to early presidential states and the South.', ' In an Iowa event on tax day, Booker unrolled an expansive income tax credit, proposing to raise the Earned Income Tax Credit by 25 percent, aiming to significantly reach more people. ', ' “We should be having the biggest increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit and that’s what I’m proposing, by making sure that anybody who works gets back from the government – if you’re earning more than $50,000 a year, or if you’re a couple, $90,000 a year -- you will get a tax credit in this country,” he said. Then he gently jabbed at the crowd for failing to react. “And by the way, before you even applaud, let me tell you,” he said to laughter. ', ' Even as Booker sought a recharge in Iowa, he was overshadowed by Buttigieg, whose unexpected surge drew among the biggest crowds for Democratic 2020 candidates touring the first-in-the-nation primary state. ', ' “I think part of it is the newness factor. We have a lot of great candidates in the field who are pretty well known. Pete’s bubbled up because he’s new and different. But also his demeanor, he’s very chill, has a great sense of humor but he’s very knowledgeable,” said Vanessa Phelan, chair of Northwest Des Moines Democrats. ', ' Phelan noted that while Buttigieg’s crowd was unexpectedly large, she’s seen many of the same people attending events for 2020 candidates as they’re still shopping around. Asked if Democrats wanted to hear Booker’s message of love and unity, she said they do – but that they want more.
