A main topic of discussion: U.S. sanctions against Russia.', 'One of the oligarchs present was Petr Aven, co-founder of Alfa Bank, Russia’s biggest commercial bank. Aven had recently met with with Putin one on one to discuss the sanctions and what to do about them. Putin said he had been struggling to get messages to Trump’s inner circle, and urged Aven to take steps to protect his bank from additional U.S. penalties, according to special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which details the episode. Aven perceived that as an order, not a request, according to Mueller, and understood “that there would be consequences if he did not follow through.”', 'Story Continued Below', 'Aven quickly understood that his mission was to contact the Trump transition team, and began an effort to contact Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.', 'Mueller’s nearly 450-page report granularly describes this and related episodes, revealing how Putin explicitly encouraged his country’s wealthiest and most powerful businessmen to make contact with Trump’s transition team after the election. The directives help explain the “flurry” of contact the oligarchs made with Trump’s associates in the weeks following the reality TV star’s unexpected victory, Mueller wrote.', 'Even though Mueller did not establish any conspiracy between Trump’s team and Russia, the special counsel’s report shows how important it was to Putin to establish a backchannel line of communication to Trump’s transition team — and how receptive Trump’s associates were to the overtures.', '“As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new Administration,” Mueller’s team wrote in their final report. ', '\n                            p. 152', 'In other words, after Trump pulled off his surprise victory in an election marred by Russia’s attempts to sow discord and buoy Trump’s candidacy, Putin wanted to cash in. ', 'The attempts entailed outreaches “sanctioned at high levels of the Russian government, through business rather than political contacts.” Putin’s chief concern, according to Mueller, was getting the incoming Trump administration to roll back the U.S. sanctions hampering the Russian economy.', 'Among the oligarchs working to make inroads with Trump was Aven, the co-founder of Russia’s biggest private financial institution, Alfa Bank; Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund; and Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian-government owned bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB.', 'Two of the wealthy moguls succeeded.', 'Dmitriev was able to get a Putin-approved U.S.-Russia “reconciliation plan” to Kushner, who passed it to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. And Gorkov scored a meeting with Kushner during the transition period to discuss U.S.-Russia relations, according to Mueller.', 'Andrew Weiss, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research on Russia and Eurasia, called the details of this outreach “striking.”', '\n                                ', ""“It wasn’t just, 'we need to build bridges for the sake of future dialogue,'” Weiss told POLITICO. “It was designed to head off further sanctions and, in Dmitriev’s case, to create a blueprint for recasting U.S. relations with Russia.”"", 'And although Aven was rebuffed in his overtures, it was not for a lack of effort. At one point, Aven enlisted an American business associate, Richard Burt, formerly a U.S. ambassador to Germany, to help get through to Kushner. ', 'According to Mueller, Aven told Burt that “someone high in the Russian government” had expressed “interest in establishing a communication channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team.” ', 'Burt apparently found Aven’s request odd, but nonetheless approached Dmitri Simes, head of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank founded by Richard Nixon, about setting up a meeting.', 'But Simes demurred, according to the report, citing the heightened media scrutiny surrounding Russia’s election interference. ', 'Aven then dropped the matter. Putin didn’t. ', ""The report says the Russian president “continued to inquire about Aven's efforts to connect to the Trump Administration in several subsequent quarterly meetings.”"", 'Steve Hall, who served as the CIA’s chief of Russian operations during Barack Obama’s second term, told POLITICO that tasking oligarchs to conduct “hybrid wars and information operations” is par for the course for Putin.

', 'Indeed, Mueller’s report includes a hefty section detailing the myriad ways Kremlin intermediaries — including fake online personas and others hiding their Moscow links — tried to woo those in and around the unlikely presidential candidate.', 'But the document did not address one of the most confounding mysteries that lingers from the election.', 'Alfa Bank, the institution Aven co-founded, had a computer server ', ' a Trump Organization server during the 2016 race. The FBI reportedly investigated the pinging and said there could be an innocuous explanation, but never provided a conclusive reason for the server activity.', 'Still, where Aven failed, Dmitriev seemingly triumphed, using many of the same tactics. ', 'Dmitriev scored meetings with both Erik Prince — an informal Trump campaign and transition team adviser — and a Kushner friend named Rick Gerson. Dmitriev, who Mueller says referred to Putin as his “boss,” worked with Gerson on the reconciliation proposal, implying that Putin had blessed the plan. ', 'The offer apparently involved “jointly fighting terrorism” and “developing ‘win-win’ economic and investment initiatives.”', 'The Russian machinations portray “both how real that effort was and how much high-level buy-in it had within the Kremlin,” said Weiss. “And the fact that Kushner passed this along to Tillerson suggests that these policies were not a nonstarter — they had the attention of Trump’s senior-most staff.”', 'Dmitriev’s intermediary to Trump’s team was George Nader, a business associate who worked for the United Arab Emirates’ royal court.

Nader told Mueller that Dmitriev pressed him for an introduction to Kushner and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Dmitriev, Nader said, wanted Nader to convey to the incoming Trump administration that Russia wanted “to start rebuilding the relationship in whatever is a comfortable pace for them.”', 'According to Mueller, Nader did just that over dinner with Erik Prince in January 2017. Prince then agreed to meet with Dmitriev in the Seychelles later that month. ', 'In an interview with the House Intelligence Committee, however, Prince characterized that meeting as an impromptu encounter during an unrelated business trip. “I didn’t fly there to meet any Russian guy,” he told lawmakers. ', 'He also told Congress that he met Dmitriev by chance at the bar and talked “over a beer.” According to Mueller, however, the two met in Nader’s villa for 30-45 minutes the same day Prince arrived. They met again at a restaurant to discuss Russia’s involvement in Libya.', 'And then there’s Sergey Gorkov, the CEO of Russia’s state-owned Vnesheconombank. ', 'Gorkov secured a meeting with Kushner in December 2016 through Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, who insisted that Kushner meet “with someone who had a direct line to Putin,” according to Mueller. Kushner told the special counsel that he could not remember them discussing sanctions, and investigators were apparently unable to establish the true nature of their conversation.', 'The meeting, however, like the others, appears to have had Putin’s blessing.

', ' and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.', 'Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind.', 'Story Continued Below', 'President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.', 'But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.', '“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”', 'Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.', '“He\'s brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He\'s going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""', 'It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.', 'Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.', '“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.', 'Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies.

Democrats had their own hawkish ', 'until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.', 'In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though ', ' show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can ', ' of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.', 'It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a ', ' for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.', 'But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.', '“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.', '“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”', '***', 'For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?', '“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.', ""“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang."", '“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.', 'He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.', '“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.', '“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.', '“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.', 'It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.', '“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”', '***', 'Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.', 'Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.', '“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”', ""He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself."", '“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”', '“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”', '***', 'As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.', 'At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.', '“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”', 'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.', 'The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.', 'One of his final ', ' of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.', '“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”', '***', 'Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.', '“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”', 'But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.', 'During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in ', ', Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen.

During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.', '“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”', 'But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.', '“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”', '“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”', 'Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.', '“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.', 'On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.', 'Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.', '“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”', '***', 'Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.', 'House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.', 'His advice: Eyes on the prize.', '“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

""An agency\'s enforcement decisions should be consonant with, rather than contrary to, the congressional policy underlying the statutes the agency is charged with administering.""', 'A senior administration official said Thursday lawyers concluded that actions like protection for parents of dreamers were “not legally available” to the president, largely because it would be building one set of executive actions upon another.', 'However, that conclusion appears to have been based heavily on historical precedent as well as legal concerns. Officials said they consider Obama’s move to allow family members of U.S. citizens to receive protection from deportation to be very similar to previous moves by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who also protected family members of individuals Congress had moved to allow to remain in the country legally.', '“We were influenced by the fact that Congress already recognized the relationship between child citizens and parents as a relationship Congress wants to protect,” said the senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “This was a sort of implementation of that congressional policy as opposed to the parents of Dreamers, which would be … slightly different. …We thought it was important to tie it to a congressional policy.”', 'While Obama is making something of a show of not granting the Dreamer parents formal deferred action status, they are largely protected from deportation by enforcement rules that makes deporting vast majority of them a low priority. In addition, some Dreamer parents will be eligible for deferred action because they also have a child who is a U.S. citizen.', '“Assuming they don’t have criminal convictions, they would in all likelihood not be deported,” the official said of Dreamer parents.', 'That treatment arises from the basic theory of prosecutorial discretion, but administration lawyers decided that wasn’t enough to take the next step and offer Dreamer parents formal deferred deportation, which carries the prospect of a work permit.', '“What we decided was that we had to tie the creation of a particular subgroup to something more than just prosecutorial discretion,” the official said. ”We didn’t think it appropriate to apply just general prosecutorial discretion and exclude a class. ... We just determined legally that we could not grant parents of Dreamers status essentially as a class.”', 'Immigrants who’ve been in the country illegally for more than five years will be eligible for deferred action if they have a U.S. citizen child by Jan. 1 of next year, officials said. That makes it to too late for anyone to get pregnant in order to qualify, but could open the door to inducing some births early in order to help parents qualify for the program. “This is not one of those situations where you can come to the country to have a baby after this announcement,” the official said.', ""The release of the Justice Department legal opinion is an unusual but far from unprecedented move. While the Obama administration has successfully fought efforts to obtain routine access to such opinions under the Freedom of Information Act, officials have put out the memos when they buttress the administration's legal arguments in a politically sensitive case, such as when Obama made a series of unusual recess appointments later deemed illegal by the Supreme Court."", ""While the White House may not have been able to dictate the actual legal advice it received from OLC, which sometimes differs with that of other lawyers in the administration and even in the White House Counsel's Office, it can control the way the questions put to OLC are framed. In this instance, according to the opinion, the formal questions sent to the Justice Department came from a senior Department of Homeland Security official on Wednesday, the same day the opinion was issued. Draft memos describing the programs were sent to DOJ on Monday, the opinion indicates."", ""It's not uncommon for White House and agency lawyers to consult extensively with OLC before a formal opinion is issued, so all involved in the deliberations likely knew what OLC's view was. Obama confirmed such discussions in comments at a news conference held Nov. 16, one to three days before the date on the source documents OLC cites about the new policy."", '""What we’ve continued to do is to talk to Office of Legal Counsel that’s responsible for telling us what the rules are, what the scope of our operations are, and determining where it is appropriate for us to say we’re not going to deport 11 million people,"" Obama told reporters.', 'In addition, the belated DHS email relaying the questions to OLC may have excluded other policy options the president considered and rejected, or that produced legal advice the White House did not wish to make public.', ""In fact, the new legal memo reports that Justice Department lawyers raised questions about the legality of Obama's 2012 DACA program before it was enacted."", '""Our preliminary view was that such a program would be permissible, provided that immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an individualized basis,"" Thompson wrote in a footnote. ""We explained, however, that extending deferred action to individuals who satisfied these and other specified criteria on a class-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action. We advised that it was critical that, like past policies that made deferred action available to certain classes of aliens, the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.""', ""The opinion issued Wednesday does not indicate that a formal opinion on the earlier DACA program was ever produced, nor does it assess whether the program as enacted complied in all respects with OLC's advice."", ""A White House spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the concerns the Justice Department raised prior to announcement of the 2012 program granting deferred deportation and work permits to Dreamers."", ' © 2019 POLITICO LLC']"

', ' “It would have been better had I used a second email account,” Clinton said, saying she had decided in 2008 before becoming secretary of state to use only one account “for convenience.” “Looking back, it would have been smarter to use two devices,” she said, insisting that she had sent all “work-related” emails to the State Department and hailing the department’s decision, announced Tuesday, to make them available online. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' At the same time, Clinton said she believed she had complied with State Department rules at the time and had not been under any obligation to use an official government email account. ', ' “I believe I have met all of my responsibilities. The server will remain private,” Clinton said. ', ' But Clinton vociferously defended her decision not to share personal details of her life, such as wedding planning, yoga lessons and decisions about her mother’s funeral. “In the end, I decided not to keep my private emails,” Clinton said. ', ' Asked whether she had been briefed on security concerns about her email setup, Clinton refused to answer directly, but volunteered that she had sent no classified emails and that there had been no security breeches of her private server. ', ' Throughout the brief question-and-answer session at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan, Clinton repeatedly deflected another key question asked by several reporters: Just how, and in what way, might this episode affect her plans to run for president in 2016. ', ' Clinton was responding to reports last week that she relied exclusively on a private email address during her four years as secretary of state, rather than an official account where the messages would likely have become part of her agency’s historical records. The Associated Press later reported that the emails were channeled through a private server registered to her suburban New York residence, to channel her messages. ', ' Meanwhile, the White House acknowledged Monday that President Barack Obama traded emails with Clinton on her private account but was said he unaware how the account was set up or that messages were not being saved in a federal archive. ', ' “The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,” said press secretary Josh Earnest. “I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.” ', ' Obama told CBS in an interview Saturday that he’d learned of Clinton’s use of a private e-mail address and server “through news reports.” However, Earnest conceded Monday that Obama knew Clinton was communicating from a private e-mail account, but was unaware of how that mail was handled or that Clinton did not have an official “state.gov” account. ', ' “Yes, the president was aware of her email address,” Earnest said. “He was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act.” ', ' The pressure on Clinton has ratcheted up as critics, including some congressional Democrats, have called on her to publicly address the reports. ', ' In December, Clinton sent 50,000 pages of emails from the private account to the State Department at its request. The agency recently turned over 900 pages of emails from Clinton’s account to a House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks in 2012. ', ' But critics have argued that Clinton’s handling of the issue as left her and her staff totally in control of screening emails and deciding which ones are responsive to government requests. ', ' Both the White House and the State Department brushed aside suggestions from that panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), that his panel may not have received all Libya-related emails. Gowdy said Clinton produced no emails from a time period when she traveled to Libya and was photographed using her BlackBerry. ', '\n  ', ' ', ' “Maybe she was using her BlackBerry to read the news,” Earnest said. “You can use your Blackberry for other things other than email, right?” ', ' State spokeswoman Jen Psaki took a similar tack, arguing that there was nothing suspicious about any gaps in the e-mail record. ', ' “I wasn’t on that trip [but] I’ve been on trips with the current secretary where there are communications issues, where you really don’t send emails,” the spokeswoman said. ', ' Earnest also said the White House had allowed the State Department to manage its own response to the latest House Benghazi inquiry. ', ' “I would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress that [Gowdy would] be complaining about that on national television as well,” the press secretary added. ', ' The White House suggested Monday that concerns were misplaced about the process Clinton used to produce her emails after the State Department requested them in October. ', ' But Earnest did not come down squarely for or against proposals that a neutral party verify that all work-related e-mails have been produced. Clinton allies suggested Sunday that she would be open to such a review. ', ' “I haven’t heard anybody or seen anybody present any evidence to indicate that [Clinton’s aides] didn’t do what they said they did,” Earnest declared. “If Secretary Clinton’s team decides that they want to go to greater lengths than they already have that ultimately is a decision for them to make.” ', ' The fact that Obama corresponded with Clinton via a private server stoked fears that the arrangement increased the risks that either of them could have been hacked or that messages between them could have been intercepted more readily than communications between two “.gov” email accounts. ', ' However, cybersecurity experts said that was not necessarily the case, since communications between government e-mail servers handling unclassified information are not always encrypted or directly connected. ', ' “There is no top-level, [Office of Management and Budget]-driven, thou-shalt-run a common-network-with-a-common-backbone, which is what we were trying to get years ago, but could just never do it,” said one expert who worked on cybersecurity issues in the George W. Bush White House and asked not to be named. E-mails “could go directly from one to another, but that depends on those two [agencies’ technology leaders’] getting together and engineering some kind of cross-connect.” ', ' The former official said that proposals over the last decade to create a government-only network went by the wayside. ', ' “The grand idea of connecting the entire federal government on fiber that’s only for the government – that’s about as practical as building a highway system that’s just for the government. Way too expensive to install, maintain and operate. So then you fall back on, okay, we’ll use commercial fiber,” the official said. ', ' The White House declined to comment Monday on whether Obama’s communication with Clinton through her private address posed any security risks or if those risks had been mitigated in some fashion. ', ' “One of the security precautions we take around the president’s email is we don’t talk about it very [much] publicly,” Earnest said, while acknowledging that policy had been breached somewhat in recent days. ', ' At the State Department, Psaki said there was no indication that the content of Clinton’s e-mail account was compromised, although she changed her address in 2011 after a hacker obtained it and posted it online. ', ' ”We don’t have any reason to believe that” outsiders gained access to her account,” the spokeswoman said. “Obviously her email wasn’t hacked.” ', ' Clinton’s expected effort to tackle questions at a press conference about her e-mail use poses risks for the former secretary, who is expected to officially announce her 2016 campaign for the White House in the next month or so. For one, she is out of practice — and hasn’t interacted much with the press since she left the State Department in 2013. ', ' One person close to the Clintons told POLITICO that whatever she says “you guys are going to just say it raises more questions than it answers” — but the person added, “it’s something she needs to do.” ', ' On March 4, Clinton announced on Twitter that she would turn over emails to the State Department for vetting and eventual public release. “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” she tweeted at the time.

0,Obama's drug-sentencing quagmire,"['\n                        Justice Department turns to ACLU, others to prepare thousands of commutation requests.', '\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN', 'President Barack Obama’s sweeping plan to commute the sentences of nonviolent drug offenders who were caught up in the disparities in laws governing crack and powder cocaine is lagging, burdened by vague guidelines, lack of Justice Department resources and the unusual decision to invite advocacy groups like the ACLU to help screen applications, according to lawyers close to the process. ', ' In the year since the Justice Department encouraged inmates to apply to cut short their sentences, more than 25,000 prisoners have come forward. But ', ' ', ', only eight were given. That reflects deeper problems in the government’s process for reviewing sentences and determining which ones are, indeed, overly long because of the crack-powder distinction, according to those familiar with the system. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The differing treatment of what would otherwise be identical cocaine-related offenses is often attributed to racial bias, as federal lawmakers chose to take a far sterner approach to controlling the types of illegal drugs sold in inner-city America rather than in white-collar precincts. Obama has long decried the “unfair system” that often sent African-American drug criminals to jail for longer terms than their white counterparts. ', ' “Because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year,” Obama declared in 2013. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' But after vowing to review the sentences of potentially thousands of nonviolent offenders, Obama’s Justice Department has yet to make much progress, as inmates anxiously await decisions. Lawyers involved in the process say they are wrestling with the huge flood of applications and struggling to determine which judge-ordered sentences may have been influenced by the crack-powder disparity, amid a three- or even four-tier review process and the ever-present fear of releasing a prisoner who might go on to commit a violent crime. ', ' “The resources are woefully inadequate to address this number of applications,” one lawyer involved in the process said. “It’s an enormous undertaking that was announced with great fanfare and promises being made without much consideration about the resources needed to get the promises fulfilled.” ', ' With too few government lawyers available to handle the applications, the Obama administration has turned to private lawyers and groups to prepare the petitions. Four organizations — the American Civil Liberties Union, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the American Bar Association — stepped up to form a consortium known as Clemency Project 2014 and to recruit more than 1,500 lawyers to handle the cases on a pro bono basis. ', ' While any prisoner can submit a commutation request directly to the Justice Department, some lawyers claim that the close coordination between the Clemency Project and the administration suggests that prisoners going through the project will have a faster, inside track. The attorneys say comments from project organizers have reinforced that impression. ', ' Administration officials insist the outside groups have no official role. All applications will be reviewed by Justice Department lawyers before recommendations are sent to the White House, they say. However, officials acknowledge that trained attorneys can help prisoners submit “well-prepared” applications that will speed processing by the relatively small staff at the department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. ', ' But even with the controversial assistance from outside groups, so far only a trickle of applications has been submitted by those organizations to the Justice Department, sources said. None of those were among the eight approved by Obama last month, all of which came from thousands of petitions already on file with the Justice Department. ', ' “So many people are expecting a lot,” said Doug Berman, a prominent criminal-sentencing specialist and law professor at Ohio State University. “I just think we’re making it much too hard, too proceduralized and, until the president starts vindicating that work with lots of [positive] outcomes, I remain kind of cynical and frustrated.” ', ' With so many thousands of petitions pending, the tiny number of commutations announced during the Christmas season prompted a new round of skepticism about the administration’s capacity to ease onerous drug sentencing ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “This is paltry,” said one lawyer familiar with the process. “It is very disappointing.” ', ' “I’d be shocked if it skyrockets to 100 before [Obama] leaves office,” another added. ', ' Obama’s aides say it’s too soon to begin to take stock of a clemency effort that was only formally announced in April, although Justice Department officials first discussed the plan publicly last January. ', ' White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said the rate of commutations is likely to pick up from the eight granted this year. “I would anticipate an uptick of that number,” he said. ', ' The White House lawyer also said the Justice Department is on the verge of working through a significant volume of cases: “I’m confident in the next short period of time their activity is going to ramp up.” ', ' However, officials declined to discuss any numerical goals for the clemency drive or to provide any details on increased staffing to accommodate the clemency effort. In addition, the administration would not commit to having all the applications processed by the time the president leaves office. ', ' At his year-end news conference, Obama didn’t directly reference his commutation drive, but he did signal a desire to make reducing the number of federal prisoners part of his legacy. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “This is the first time in 40 years where the federal prison population and the crime rate have gone down at the same time, which indicates the degree to which it is possible for us to think smarter about who we are incarcerating, how long, how we deal with nonviolent offenders, how we deal with drug offenders,” Obama said. “We can do a better job and save money by initiating some of these reforms.” ', ' ', ' ', ' Obama’s drive to increase the number of presidential commutations has been fueled in part by his view that recent legislation reining in overly long drug sentences unwisely neglected to reduce the sentences of prisoners already serving long terms, current and former officials say. ', ' But the relatively small Office of the Pardon Attorney wasn’t prepared to handle such a high volume of cases, so officials encouraged the groups forming the Clemency Project to recruit and train private attorneys to prepare applications. The organizations have instituted their own screening effort to try to determine if prisoners meet the criteria and to make sure the private lawyers spend time on meritorious cases. ', ' Still, the involvement of advocacy groups is unusual and, to some, inappropriate. Some conservatives have complained that routing applications for early release through these organizations amounts to Obama abdicating responsibility for managing the clemency process. ', ' “The question is, can the president outsource his clemency and pardon authority? And that’s what he seems to be doing here. It’s another case where the president, it appears, is abusing his authority,” said Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch. “These groups don’t share a concern for public safety.” ', ' Some liberal-leaning lawyers and clemency advocates have their own complaints. They say the private consortium has taken on an outsize, quasi-official role in the process and has an inherent conflict of interest: Project organizers want to get the strongest possible applications to the Justice Department, which may mean abandoning prisoners whose cases fall into a gray area. ', ' “It bothers me that you have a group of private citizens who have an under-the-table deal with the deputy attorney general to help him do his job and the promise is, ‘We’re going to put your guys at the front of the list,’” one lawyer involved said. “Instead of dealing with a process that’s already opaque and bureaucratic and too slow, they’ve added this additional layer that’s even more opaque and bureaucratic and too slow.” ', ' A Justice Department official denied that applications by the Clemency Project will receive special treatment. ', ' “We’re not giving Clemency Project 2014 any special priority,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “This is not to say applications coming from the Clemency Project might not possibly be of better quality,” the official added, alluding to officials’ hope that the project can help prisoners make their best case for early release. ', ' In June, Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit demanding correspondence between the outside groups and DOJ, hoping to expose backdoor deals between the Clemency Project and the government. A judge has given the department until February to respond. ', ' In addition, sources told POLITICO that questions were also raised inside the project about whether its work with the Justice Department might fall under a sunshine law governing official advisory panels, which could require the groups to open their work to the public. However, DOJ lawyers who looked into the matter concluded the law does not apply. ', ' Indeed, the Justice Department denies there is any official relationship between the consortium and the department. “They are not an advisory committee at all,” a Justice official said. “The Clemency Project is completely separate from us.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

', 'Story Continued Below', ' “A corrosive culture has led to personnel problems across the Department that are seriously impacting morale and by extension, the timeliness of health care,” the report states. “The problems inherent within an agency with an extensive field structure are exacerbated by poor management and communication structures, distrust between some VA employees and management, a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues, and a lack of accountability across all grade levels.” ', ' ( ', ') ', ' These newest allegations are added trouble for the embattled department, which is facing heavy criticism for extensive wait times for veterans seeking medical care, a scandal that forced then-Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. ', ' The reports grew so severe that Obama was forced to dispatch in May a top deputy, Rob Nabors, to study the medical care systems within the VA and recommend specific ways to combat its problems. ', ' Nabors, the deputy chief of staff, has been asked “to continue to assist the department during this time of transition,” the White House said. ', ' ( ', ""') "", ' The White House-led report found that the VA’s 14-day scheduling standard — a rule which bans VA hospitals from keeping patients from seeing a doctor for longer than two weeks — are “ill-defined.” This standard may have contributed, Nabors found, to the VA falsifying wait lists for veterans. ', ' “There is a tendency to transfer problems rather than solve problems,” the report found. “This is in part due to the difficulty of hiring and firing in the federal government.” ', ' The report also charged that the VA was slow to adapt to changing demographics among veterans, including an influx of female patients and younger veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who have different needs than traditional patients. ', ' Nabors recommends that the VA train additional doctors, nurses and other health care staff to help decrease wait times for veterans. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Obama met Friday with Nabors and acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson to discuss the report’s findings. ', ' But the White House did note that the VA has made strides since the wait lists became public. ', ' The White House says the agency scheduled 182,000 appointments and allocated nearly $400 million toward accelerated care. The department also launched a comprehensive review of its whistle-blower system after employees said they were punished when internally airing concerns over standards of care. ', ' The report was met with mixed reactions from Congress, though lawmakers in both chambers said they were ready to work with the Obama administration to tackle the problems within the VA. ', ' “While it’s extremely unfortunate President Obama did not heed our warnings about the very real and very deadly problems within the VA health care system sooner, we stand ready to work with stakeholders inside and outside the administration to institute VA reforms that will improve services to America’s veterans while bringing real accountability and efficiency to the department,” said Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. ', ' Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) praised Nabors for the “excellent report.” ', ' “Our job as a Congress and as a nation is to make the necessary changes so that every veteran in the VA system gets the quality and timely health care they are entitled to,” Sanders said. ', ' Sander and Miller are among two dozen members working on a House and Senate conference committee to craft a reform bill. That legislation will likely include broader authority for the VA secretary to fire employees for misconduct and give veterans the ability to seek care outside the VA system if they’ve been waiting longer than 30 days for medical care.

0,Report: FBI still outgunned by terror threat,"['\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN', '\n                    Updated ', 'A blue-ribbon panel that reviewed the FBI’s response to challenges after the Sept. 11 attacks has concluded that the premier federal law-enforcement agency isn’t moving fast enough to transform itself into an intelligence operation that can predict terrorist attacks and gather information overseas about threats to Americans. ', ' The three-member board tempered its criticism of the FBI with plaudits for its progress since 2001, but the commission said more change is “urgently” needed — a critique that seems particularly pointed in light of the more than 13 years that have passed since the Al Qaeda-directed attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “During the decade and a half after 9/11, the FBI has changed. It is currently changing, but must urgently and boldly accelerate this change,” former Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Colo.) said during a press conference at FBI Headquarters in Washington. “Leadership at all levels of the FBI is not unified or consistent in driving cultural change. … Over the course of this next century, hundreds of Americans’ lives will depend on it.” ', ' In an effort to embrace the report’s themes, FBI Director James Comey appeared Wednesday morning with Roemer and the two other panel members: former Attorney General Ed Meese and Georgetown University Professor Bruce Hoffman. ', ' “The progress has been extraordinary … but it’s not good enough,” Comey declared as he welcomed the report, ordered by Congress to assess the FBI’s compliance with recommendations put forward by the original 9/11 Commission. ', ' Among the ', ' key findings: ', ' — The FBI hasn’t done enough to integrate intelligence analysts into the bureau’s work and still lacks a clear career path for such specialists, resulting in many of them leaving for jobs elsewhere in the government. ', ' — The bureau’s practice of rotating personnel through top assignments disrupts their ability to oversee needed changes and to develop expertise critical to assessing terrorism and national security threats. ', ' — Some FBI agents stationed abroad, called legal attachés, don’t have the equipment needed to easily access sensitive intelligence and lack the necessary authority to marshal resources. ', ' — Improving information sharing with state and local officials is a post-9/11 “good news story,” but some local and state police officials still feel they’re simply mined for data and rarely get back information from the feds. ', ' — The FBI should get out of the business of what federal officials refer to as “countering violent extremism,” because it is ill-suited to such work. ', ' Comey said he agreed with many of the report’s recommendations, but he challenged the proposal that the FBI leave counter-extremism work to other agencies. ', ' “I respectfully disagree with the review commission,” the director said. “It should not be focused on messages about faith it should not be socially focused, but we have an expertise … I have these people who spend all day long thinking dark thoughts and doing research at Quantico, my Behavioral Analysis Unit. They have an incredibly important role to play in countering violent extremism.” ', ' Some counter-extremism experts and many in the Muslim community have argued that the FBI and federal prosecutors — who play key roles in the current effort — are not the best interlocutors because they’re perceived as trying to develop informants rather than help communities head off trouble. The review panel seems to back that view, while adding that the FBI effort is too poorly funded to make a significant impact. ', ' “The FBI should not be utilizing their resources in what you might call the retail business of countering propaganda,” Meese said. “The bureau doesn’t have the resources to get into the business of the … social and preventive aspects of it.” ', ' Roemer pointed to language report language, saying the FBI’s “fundamental law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities do not make it an appropriate vehicle” for such counter-extremism efforts. ', ' The panel also looked at the FBI’s still-ongoing investigation of the 9/11 attacks, as well as new case theories. The commission concluded that an FBI source reported to have been a potential route to reach Osama bin Laden in the early 1990s may not have ever been in direct contact with the Al Qaeda leader, and there was no reason to think that would have produced information on an attack whose planning began in 1998 or 1999. ', ' The review group also dismissed reports that a Saudi family living in Sarasota, Florida, described as having fled the U.S. soon after the 9/11 attacks, had links to the hijackers or the crime. ', ' The commission did find that there is “ongoing internal debate” within the FBI about whether two of the hijackers may have had assistance as they prepared for the attack or shared plans for the crime with others. ', ' “The fact that there is some debate, internal debate within the FBI between different teams, I think, we found that to be healthy — productive,” Roemer said. ', ' Comey said the internal discussions haven’t changed the FBI’s basic conclusions about 9/11, but they are evidence that agency continues to challenge its assumptions. ', ' “We have no credible evidence that there were additional participants, supporters, funders that we haven’t charged, we haven’t identified,” the director said. “No one has forgotten. We’re continuing to see is this lead worth pursuing is that lead worth pursuing and arguing with each other about what could be drawn from what leads.” ', ' The report also looks at five major terrorism cases the FBI has handled since 9/11 and evaluates its performance. The panel said that more aggressive collection of human intelligence in Boston’s Muslim community could have alerted the bureau to the fact that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev had angry outbursts that led to his banning by a local mosque. ', ' Comey said he believed the FBI could try to gather information on potential crimes while still respecting religious freedom.

', ' Barring an 11th-hour surprise, Lynch is likely to be confirmed. But with four GOP senators currently backing her along with unanimous support from Senate Democrats, Lynch would secure the bare minimum required to be installed as the nation’s top cop – as long as senators hauled in Vice President Joe Biden to break a tie. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Several Republican senators who could have been potential “yes” votes are signaling ahead of the confirmation vote that that they will instead vote against her. The overwhelming bloc of opposition from Republicans stems from President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, and Lynch’s confirmation is also plagued with remnants of congressional Republicans’ toxic relations with current attorney general Eric Holder. \n ', ' ', ' Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said when he met with Lynch more than two months ago, he asked the federal prosecutor to lay out how the Justice Department’s agenda would differ than that of Holder, who’s led the Justice Department since 2009. \n ', ' ', ' “She told me it would not be different,” Burr recalled of his conversation with the nominee. “I voted against Eric Holder and he’s lived up to exactly what I thought he would.” \n ', ' ', ' But Lynch, who would be the first black woman to lead the Justice Department, is drawing potential opposition on other issues. Republican Sen. Dean Heller said in an interview that he is “leaning no” on the confirmation vote expected next week, a view that is based on Lynch’s answers to his concerns about how to regulate gambling.The Nevada senator said Lynch’s responses to a letter he sent following up on the issue left him “not very comfortable.” \n ', ' ', ' “She said she has very little knowledge of what occurred in the Wire Act,” a 1961 law that banned certain types of interstate gambling, Heller said. “And yet at the same time, she prosecuted illegal gambling, offshore gambling. You can’t be prosecuting illegal gambling and say you have very little knowledge of the Wire Act itself.” \n ', ' ', ' The confirmation showdown is set for next week. Senate Majority Leader McConnell hasn’t indicated how he will vote, though two members of his leadership team – Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the fifth-ranking Republican – are confirmed “no” votes. \n ', ' ', ' Senate Republicans who are backing her are Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine. \n ', ' ', ' Democrats have argued that Republicans’ anger over Obama’s executive actions on immigration – which would halt deportations and give work permits for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally – shouldn’t be a factor in whether or not to confirm Lynch. She said during her confirmation hearing in January that she believes the presidential directives are legal. \n ', ' ', ' But that hasn’t swayed Republican senators, who say they were troubled by her stance on the immigration matter. \n ', ' ', ' Her supporters have also highlighted that Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York who was nominated as attorney general in November, has had to wait longer than any person to be confirmed to lead the Justice Department. \n ', ' ', ' Part of the reason Lynch has had to wait for more than five months is because Democrats chose to not jam her nomination through the last two months of Democratic control of the Senate late last year. But Lynch has also had to wait longer than other attorney general nominees to get a floor vote once they cleared the Judiciary Committee. \n ', ' ', ' For example, Janet Reno’s nomination went to the Senate floor one day after the committee vote. It took the nomination of John Ashcroft two days, Alberto Gonzalez waited eight days, and Michael Mukasey took two days. Holder’s nomination went from a committee vote to floor vote in five days. \n ', ' ', ' For Lynch, the lag is 14 days and counting. \n ', ' ', ' “Ms. Lynch’s nomination has broad support from Democrats and Republicans across the legal and law enforcement communities – so there is no excuse” for the wait, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said this week. “She should not be treated any differently than previous nominees. \n ', ' ', ' Some Republicans said while they were undecided, Lynch’s comments on immigration would likely be a factor in making up their mind. \n ', ' ', ' “I think that’s a big issue,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who has yet to decide, said about the executive actions. “I think that’ll weigh in on the decision that I would make, too.” \n ', ' ', ' Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), another swing vote, added: “I have concerns over what she said about the executive order, but I’d really like to meet with her.” \n ', ' ', ' Other undecided Republican senators include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee. Both men have shown varying levels of unease with Lynch’s nomination. \n ', ' ', ' Alexander told POLITICO two weeks ago that he was “deeply concerned about her refusal to put limits on the president’s executive power.” And when Corker met with Lynch late last year, he had some questions for her on the issue of selective enforcement — when officials exercise discretion on law enforcement — and he noted at the time that he felt her answers could “use some sharpening.” \n ', ' ', ' Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) met with Lynch recently and while he is undecided, he indicated that he was pleased with what he’s heard so far. \n ', ' ', ' “I had a very good meeting with her,” Kirk said of his sit-down with Lynch, where the conversation revolved around federal efforts to combat gang violence. “She was very well prepared.” \n ', ' ', ' ', ' \n ', ' ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

', 'Story Continued Below', ' Republicans close to Christie and his team say the past week represented their most concerted effort so far to get clear of the Fort Lee traffic scandal.

He said he is prepared to follow the Gibson Dunn report’s advice when it comes to the management of his administration, and perhaps a suggestion to break up the Port Authority into separate New York and New Jersey entities. ', ' If the page-turning process is far from complete, the immediate goal of Christie’s multi-day media tour was more realistic: to get out of a defensive posture and give the governor something more concrete to say when people ask him about the mess unfolding in his home state. ', ' The move from playing defense to leaning forward was on vivid display in the contrast between a soft-focus Thursday interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer and his combative Friday press conference. In the space of a day, Christie went from sighing about “Bridgegate” as the “toughest time in my professional life” – an episode in which he “fell short” as a leader – to chastising reporter after reporter for, he said, getting their facts wrong. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The abrupt shift startled even some Christie allies, who expected him to extend his hair-shirt approach into another public appearance. ', ' “Why don’t you just get to the question, cut the commentary a little,” he urged one reporter Friday, only shortly after the start of his press conference. “You have to get the facts right if you’re going to ask me a question,” Christie told another. He described two different questions as “beneath” the reporters who asked them. ', ' The former federal prosecutor even reiterated, at some length, that he will decide whether or not to run for president independently of this whole unpleasant saga. Christie said he didn’t think the George Washington Bridge fiasco would weigh heavily on how voters consider “my candidacy, if there even is one.” ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “The way I’ll make a decision about whether to seek any future office will be: do I think it’s best for me and my family, and I do I have something unique and particular to offer?” he said. “Anybody who tries to game out the politics of this stuff years in advance, the last several weeks have probably shown them that that’s a fool’s errand.” ', ' Christie acknowledged up front that the Fort Lee story is not over. “I think the report will stand the test of time, but it will be tested,” he said. ', ' The idea is not to close the book on “Bridgegate” forever. Christie’s team is well aware that months of legislative and prosecutorial inquiries lie ahead.

', ' Some family members of hostages say the government’s system for dealing with hostage negotiations lacks coordination and leaves desperate families in the dark. At the White House, the Obama administration faced new questions Wednesday about whether it did all it could to save Mueller, a 26-year-old peace activist from Arizona. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' On Capitol Hill, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who has pressed the White House to streamline the handling of international hostage crises, told POLITICO he will soon introduce legislation that would shift leadership from the FBI to a governmentwide coordinator. ', ' The coordinator, he said, might put the Defense Department or the Central Intelligence Agency in charge of responding to a hostage-taking that takes place in a conflict zone overseas. With their larger footprints abroad, those agencies stand a better chance of avoiding the bureaucratic tangles and inertia that have plagued the U.S. government’s response to the plight of captured Americans, the congressman argues. ', ' “The administration has to have a coherent policy that uses the people who have the best chance of getting American and allied hostages home alive,” said Hunter. “That’s not the FBI, unless the hostages are in the Capitol building or somewhere else in the United States.” ', ' Hunter contends that the FBI is ill-suited to investigating and resolving hostage situations that take place in chaotic places like Syria, Libya or Yemen. ', ' “If the FBI wants to close down some of the stuff they’re doing here in the U.S. and move 2,000 agents to each of these hot spots, I guess that could work out — in the next 20 years or so,” the congressman said sarcastically. ', ', ', ' and ', ' “What we’re talking about is actually having a shot at hostage recovery and the only guys who have a shot at it are the ones running networks tracking down terrorists and [their] organizations,” such as the military or the CIA, Hunter added. “What you don’t want are people who are not out there talking to them every day, paying people off and getting information.” ', ' Families who’ve pressed or are still pressing for the release of loved ones overseas seem to disagree about whether there’s a major problem with U.S. hostage recovery efforts or the FBI’s role. ', ' The mother of James Foley — an American journalist held hostage in Syria for more than a year and a half before being beheaded by ISIL in August — said Wednesday she doesn’t fault the FBI in particular but does favor a strong governmentwide coordinator to handle hostage cases. ', ' “I think the FBI is good at getting information. I think the problem is they didn’t know what to do with it,” Diane Foley said in an interview. “Everybody’s hands seemed to be tied, and nobody was accountable to get them home. … It was really bungled big time.” ', ' Mueller’s family expressed praise for the FBI in a statement released Tuesday. ', ' “We would like to thank the FBI agents that have been working with … the family. They have been amazing,” said Lori Lyon, one of Kayla Mueller’s aunts. ', ' By contrast, the parents of freelance journalist Austin Tice — still missing after being captured in Syria in 2012 — complain of disarray in the response of government agencies, including the FBI. ', ' “Amongst the agencies, the FBI, the intelligence community, the State Department and some elements of the White House, information sharing is very poor,” Tice’s father, Mark, said last week at the National Press Club. “I’m not telling you secrets because each of those agencies have told us the same thing. That’s something that needs to be fixed. … You need to [have] clear driving lanes. Who’s responsible for what. Who’s in charge. Who’s accountable. It’s not there yet.” ', ' Tice’s parents have called for the same type of post Hunter’s legislation would establish — a permanent, designated office in the government to coordinate response to hostage-taking overseas. ', ' The death of aid worker Kayla Mueller is fueling charges that bureaucratic infighting and poor communication. | AP Photo ', '\n  ', ' ', ' “It’s appalling to us that no such entity currently exists,” Tice’s mother, Debra, said. “There is no agency, no person solely committed to the singular objective of the safe return of the hostage. That has to change.” ', ' The Tices have also complained that the FBI reluctantly shares information with families, citing classified information concerns. However, families of U.S. military prisoners whose cases are handled by the Pentagon have received detailed intelligence briefings, a Hunter aide said. ', ' Last fall, after complaints from hostages’ families about their dealings with the government, the Obama administration launched a “comprehensive review” of how such cases are addressed. However, there are questions about the depth of that review. ', ' A letter the Pentagon sent in November seems to pre-suppose that the FBI will retain its key position in hostage cases. “This review will seek to integrate innovation and non-traditional solutions to result in recommended actions to improve interagency coordination and strengthen the whole-of-government approach led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department,” Undersecretary of Defense Christine Wormuth wrote to Hunter. ', ' At the White House, President Obama said that a U.S. military raid he ordered in July was aimed at rescuing Mueller, in addition to others being held captive in Syria. Press secretary Josh Earnest said the president did not dawdle in green-lighting the rescue mission, as some reports suggested. No prisoners were found by the U.S. commandos who stormed the site. ', ' “I can confirm for you there was no delay in the president’s decision to order this military raid as soon as he and his military advisers and his national security team had confidence, based on a high degree of confidence, where exactly she was,” Earnest said. “And that is why the president can say unequivocally that he and his administration and this government did everything that we could to try to secure the safe return of Kayla Mueller.” ', ' The White House and other administration officials did not respond to questions about what actions they took in Mueller’s case between the July raid and the family’s receipt of an email over the weekend with photographic proof that Mueller was dead. ISIL has claimed she was killed in a Jordanian air raid, but Earnest said he doubts that is true. ', ' The drive to shift overseas hostage cases away from the FBI and toward the military dovetails with a recurring GOP critique of the Obama administration: that it treats the battle against terrorist groups too much like a traditional law enforcement operation rather than a military campaign. ', ' A White House spokesman said he would have no comment on Hunter’s legislation until it is officially introduced. However, a U.S. official defended the FBI’s role in the process and called the congressman’s proposal misguided. ', ' “I don’t know where the congressman is going because it doesn’t make any sense,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “To say the FBI ought to be taken away because [they’re] nice or whatever doesn’t make any sense because it’s not [the FBI’s]. … It’s an interagency effort where it’s all hands on deck.” ', ' The official said the FBI brings a “skill set” in dealing with families, handling ransom demands, conducting interviews and collecting evidence, but works closely with the military in conflict zones. ', ' A former FBI official said the July raid to try to rescue Mueller and other hostages confirms that the FBI’s role doesn’t inhibit assertive action to recover hostages. ', ' “What’s the problem? The FBI didn’t stand in the way of multiple attempts to rescue American hostages,” former FBI Assistant Director for International Operations Tom Fuentes said. “The fact that [Mueller] got killed or wasn’t rescued had nothing to do with whether the military or any one agency had the lead. If the intelligence is there, the president is going be the one that has to authorize the mission because it is so risky and requires so much coordination.” ', ' Some officials suggested that the challenge in recovering hostages held in Syria isn’t a problem of interagency cooperation or communication. They say it centers on very limited intelligence about where prisoners are being held and by whom. ', ' “It is a tremendously challenging collection environment for all of our intelligence agencies because we’re not present on the ground there [in Syria] in the traditional way,” National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen said Wednesday at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on the so-called foreign fighter threat. “We don’t have the footprint on the ground that we would have in many places around the world with a diplomatic, military and intelligence presence. And so, we’re forced to be more creative, more innovative, more entrepreneurial in trying to close that gap.” ', ' “I would not argue, though, that we have closed the gap on where we need to be in terms of our understanding with granularity what’s going on on the ground in Syria,” Rasmussen added. ', ' Still, some officials who’ve handled hostage cases say Hunter’s proposal for a dedicated leader of hostage recovery efforts outside the FBI has merit. ', ' “It’s probably not a bad idea,” said former CIA officer Bob Baer. “The problem with leaving the FBI in charge is they are looking for an indictment and that isn’t really tied to your first interest. We don’t need to worry about indicting Jihad John. … The problem with having the police in charge of this is they’re really not geared towards intelligence collection.” ', ' Former National Security Council official Dane Egli said he doesn’t object to the FBI’s current role but believes there is wisdom in designating a government-wide coordinator. “You need a neutral arbiter who can bring together interlocutors across the interagency, which is a complex web sometimes,” he said. “The point is to have a more visible, active coordination.” ', ' Hunter said he plans to offer the legislation as an amendment to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. He said he expects the measure to have wide support in the House Armed Services Committee, on which he serves. But he also expects a fight from others on Capitol Hill, including the FBI. ', ' “I expect them to be even more resistant than they have been to giving up any turf, even if it’s for the betterment of the families, the hostages or our country,” Hunter said.

0,Could Hillary have compromised the president's emails?,"['\n                        Clinton could have been hacked without knowing it, cybersecurity experts say, but Obama’s security is so high that an intruder couldn’t take advantage of a breach.', '\n                    By DAVID NATHER and JOSEPH MARKS', '\n                Illustration by POLITICO / iStock', 'President Barack Obama’s emails to Hillary Clinton are only as safe as the security of her private system, cybersecurity experts say – but his own email security is so strong that they believe the risks would have been limited. ', ' There’s a danger that the president’s email address could have been exposed, along with the contents of anything he sent to Clinton, if her email account or the private server that hosted it were hacked. And the experts point out that Clinton’s system could easily have been hacked without her knowing it. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “To say it wasn’t compromised is to say, ‘I don’t know it was compromised,’” said Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary who specializes in technology and security. “It would be pretty easy for a nation-state to compromise that account, and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account.” ', ' All the same, former cybersecurity officials familiar with the White House system say Obama is protected by such a high level of security measures, including constant monitoring by a computer security team, that it would have been virtually impossible for anyone to take advantage of a breach. ', ' “He’s protected by a really, really good setup. No one in the country has better security than he has,” said Richard “Dickie” George, a former National Security Agency technical director who led a team that built Obama’s Blackberry. ', 'JEFF GERTH', ' Clinton didn’t say much about the cybersecurity issue at her press conference in New York on Tuesday, and what she did say isn’t likely to settle the questions. She said the server and email system was set up for former President Bill Clinton’s office and had “numerous safeguards,” but she didn’t give even a general idea of what they were — other than being physically protected by the Secret Service. ', ' “It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,” Clinton insisted. ', ' A ', ' released by Clinton’s office said she wouldn’t provide key details for security reasons, like whether her emails were encrypted and who the service provider was. ', ' “While the curiosity in the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill-intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices,” the document states. “However, suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.” ', ' That’s not going to be enough to satisfy the questions being raised by other cybersecurity experts about the safety of her arrangement. Melissa Hathaway, a former White House cybersecurity official under Obama and President George W. Bush, gave a terse response: “Was it encrypted? If not, then it was likely exposed.” ', ' It’s not impossible that anyone who got into Clinton’s emails would have seen Obama’s email address. But George said that even if Obama’s email address was exposed, it would have been highly unlikely that any outsiders would successfully send emails to the president of the United States – in part because of the monitoring, but also because Obama’s email account uses “whitelisting,” meaning it only accepts emails from approved addresses. ', ' Unlike regular email accounts, where a user can block emails from certain addresses, anyone who wants to email Obama has to have their address physically added in advance to a list of acceptable emails, George said. ', ' And some cybersecurity officials are sure that Obama would have been careful not to say anything sensitive — because his emails to Clinton would have been unclassified, and Obama would have been well aware of that. ', ' “He’s actually very security conscious … There’s no, absolutely no, chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails,” George said. ', ' “If real government business was being discussed on these personal accounts, then the only thing really violated was the requirement for archiving public records,” said Bruce Brody, a former information security official at the Department of Energy. “But if the nature of these conversations was ‘I saw you on Meet the Press’ or ‘tell the former POTUS he looks good after the weight loss,’ then we as taxpayers shouldn’t be too concerned about all of this.” ', ' Baker, however, says even the most boring emails from Obama could contain something of interest to foreign governments. If nothing else, they could give a general sense of what he’s doing or what he’s interested in at a given moment. ', ' “There’s more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think, just because he’s the president of the damned United States,” Baker said. ', ' It’s not clear how much safer Clinton’s emails would have been if she had used an official State Department account. ', ' An Office of Management and Budget report last month listed the State Department as one of six federal agencies that “have no ability to use … [government standard] encryption when sending [unclassified email] messages.” ', ' But the State Department disputes this, saying its outgoing emails have met government encryption standards since 2008, and officials at Foggy Bottom say that section of the OMB report is misleading. In reality, all emails sent within the State Department are encrypted because the network itself is encrypted, a department official familiar with the State Department computer network said. ', ' Either way, most non-government security experts doubt that Clinton’s homebrew server could match the security of State’s own email system. ', ' “The State Department has its own full time security team and the NSA helping out,” ACLU Principal Technologist Chris Soghoian said. “Unless she was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure, it’s likely it was less secure.” ', ' The White House is refusing to comment on the specifics of Obama’s cybersecurity arrangements, insisting, as deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz did Tuesday, that “part of the security precautions we take around that email account is not talking about it much publicly.” ', ' But the questions aren’t going away, especially from Republicans in Congress. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said in a statement that he’ll call Clinton to testify in a separate hearing about her use of the private email account, in addition to the testimony he wants from her on Benghazi. He also called on Clinton to turn her server over to a “neutral, detached third-party arbiter” to determine which emails should be released. ', ' “There remain serious questions about the security of the system she employed from a national security standpoint, who authorized this exclusive use of personal email despite guidance to the contrary from both her State Department and the White House, who had access to the server from the time Secretary Clinton left office until the time — almost two years later — the State Department asked for these public records back, and who culled through the records to determine which were personal and which were public,” Gowdy said. ', ' Although the statement from Clinton’s office insisted there had never been a hack or an “unauthorized intrusion” into her email, it acknowledged that her private email address was exposed in 2013 after a hacker named “Guccifer” broke into the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, a former journalist and close friend of the Clintons. The Daily Beast ', ' that her address was contained in the Blumenthal emails.

0,State Dept. changes story on Clinton emails,"['\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN', '\n                    Updated ', 'In a reversal, the State Department acknowledged Friday that a Congressional investigation into the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi played a role in the agency’s decision to ask Hillary Clinton and three other secretaries of state to turn over copies of all work-related emails they sent or received on private accounts during their tenure. ', ' State spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that a special House committee’s ongoing probe into the Benghazi incident was one of many factors that led the department to send a request last October that resulted in Clinton sending her former agency 55,000 pages of emails she exchanged on an unofficial account. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “Certainly, that’s a factor, but … as we’ve said now a few times, it was not any one thing that prompted this,” Harf said at a daily briefing dominated by questions about the email issue dogging Clinton as she prepares to launch a presidential bid. “It would be grossly simplistic to say that any one thing prompted us to send this letter.” ', ' Earlier this week, Harf and other state department officials said the decision to approach the former secretaries about searching their personal email accounts stemmed solely from a broad effort to update the State Department’s electronic recordkeeping efforts. ', ' “When in the process of updating our records management — this is something that’s sort of ongoing given technology and the changes — we reached out to all of the former secretaries of state to ask them to provide any records they had,” she said Tuesday. ', ' Asked that day if there was any link between Benghazi-related document requests and the missive to Clinton and other secretaries, Harf replied, “It went in October of 2014 – that was before we had gotten a request from the [Benghazi select] committee – as part of our records maintenance upgrading and the process we go through. So that was what drove that.” ', ' A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Tuesday that the request for Clinton’s records was “independent” of and unrelated to the Benghazi probe. ', ' POLITICO reported Friday that White House officials became aware in August that documents sought in the House Benghazi investigation contained Clinton’s private email address. The White House flagged the issue to the State Department and Clinton aides, but the former secretary’s staff decided to take no action at that point. ', ' The issue remained under wraps until earlier this week when The New York Times reported that Clinton relied solely on a private email account during her service as America’s top diplomat. ', ' Late Friday, a senior State official emphasized that only a fraction of the Clinton e-mails provided to State pertained to Benghazi. ', ' “An October letter went out to all former Secretaries in an effort to ensure the preservation of official records, particularly given recent [National Archives] guidance and the increasing reliance on email. Like other agencies across the government, we are also in the process of updating our processes to manage and preserve records in an electronic format,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “While a small percentage of Secretary Clinton’s emails were responsive to the Select Committee’s November request, the vast majority were unrelated and it would be oversimplified and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the preservation of her records was done for one purpose.” ', ' Developments in the email saga and other controversies that have caused headaches for Clinton’s yet-to-be-launched presidential bid continued to unfold Friday. ', ' A top adviser to President Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, suggested that Clinton’s reliance on private email for official work went against clearly established White House directives. ', ' “I do know that obviously the president has a very firm policy that email should be kept on government systems. He believes in transparency,” Jarrett said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “I know that the State Department is currently working with the National Archives to make sure that all of Secretary Clinton’s emails are captured.” ', ' Jarrett declined to say directly whether Clinton violated policy, saying such a determination was for State to make. “We established the policy here, but then we leave it up to every single agency to determine how to adhere to that policy,” the Obama adviser said. ', ' But a potential Republican rival to Clinton in the presidential race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seemed to suggest that Clinton’s use of a personal email server jeopardized sensitive State Department information. He described her use of a personal email server as “baffling.” ', ' “For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is and it’s a dangerous world and security would mean that you couldn’t have a private server,” Bush told Radio Iowa. “It’s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn’t come up in Secretary Clinton’s thought process.” ', ' Bush also had his own private web domain and e-mail account as governor. Some of those messages were requested and disclosed under state public records laws while the former governor was in office from 1999 to 2007. ', ' Bush apparently took the archive with him when he left, but sent a subset of 250,000 of those emails to a state archive last year. The former governor also released them to the public last month on a website designed to bolster his presidential hopes. ', ' and ', ' Some of Clinton’s records are expected to be made public by the State Department, but that could take months. ', ' Meanwhile, another venture that has caused negative headlines for Clinton in recent weeks, the Clinton Foundation, is going to be put under the management of a longtime Clinton loyalist: former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. ', ' The foundation came under fire last month for resuming fundraising from foreign governments after Hillary Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in 2013. ', ' Shalala, who resigned last year as president of the University of Miami, is expected to move to New York soon to become chief executive officer of the foundation. ', ' Eric Braverman stepped down from that post in January in what ', ' was a power struggle between veteran Clinton backers and skilled outsiders brought in to professionalize the foundation. ', ' Clinton loyalists insist that none of the current controversies will register with voters. But with questions swirling about whether the private email arrangement was intended to prevent access to her records and whether it complied with federal laws and regulations, Clinton called Wednesday for the State Department to make the 55,000 pages of emails public. ', ' “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” Clinton tweeted. ', ' Harf indicated Friday that State’s review of the documents is still getting underway. “That will start soon,” she said, cautioning that it is likely to take several months. ', ' The State spokeswoman said the review process will use normal standards for Freedom of Information Act requests. Those rules require deletion of classified national security information, personal information and business secrets, and allow for deletion of information about internal decision-making processes and legal advice. ', ' Harf denied a report in The Washington Post that State was reviewing Clinton’s email in a search for potential security violations. “An initial press report that we are doing an investigation of her email for security reasons is not correct,” she said. ', ' At the briefing Friday, Hart tangled with reporters who said State Department regulations, a cable sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts in 2011 and a State Department inspector general report from 2012 all made clear that State employees should not routinely use personal email for official business. ', ' “I think you’re oversimplifying,” she said, insisting that the warnings applied only to use of personal email for information considered “sensitive but unclassified.” ', ' “It was not a general policy or guidance about email use in general. It refers to one specific kind of email use,” Harf added. ', ' POLITICO reported Thursday that a provision in State’s Foreign Affairs Manual states: “It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized [State Department computer system], which has the proper level of security control …” ', ' While the provision appears to make a general statement about agency policy, Harf noted that the section of the manual in which the language appears is devoted to “sensitive but unclassified” information. ', ' Harf said the 2011 cable urging State staff to “avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts” was simply advice prompted by hacking incidents Google announced publicly at the time. ', ' “It’s helpful tips for people … some helpful tips when you’re using personal email,” she said. ', ' Harf flatly denied that political pressure from the White House, Clinton aides or Clinton supporters was affecting the State Department’s handling of the email situation or would impact the review. However, the spokeswoman continued to have no response to questions about whether anyone at the department specifically authorized Clinton’s use of the personal account as her sole email or whether anyone discouraged her from using such an account due to the dangers of hacking. ', ' Harf provided a bit more detail about the 55,000 pages of email records, saying they arrived from Clinton’s aides in paper form and span the entirety of her time as secretary. The spokeswoman confirmed that the department relies on Clinton’s camp to decide which email were work-related, a practice Harf said is consistent with each government employee’s duty to preserve official records. ', ' “It wasn’t spreadsheets for [Clinton’s] daughter’s wedding, but it was anything related to official business,” Harf said. ', ' “Each individual employee has a responsibility under the federal regulations to preserve their own records. With a State Department account or a personal account, when you walk out the door, it is your responsibility to provide those,” Harf said. ', ' “When you walk out?” a reporter asked, alluding to the fact that Clinton did not provide her records when she departed, but some 23 months later.

But her unwavering focus on such themes has been tested in recent weeks by swirling controversies over her use of a personal email address as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation’s fundraising from foreign governments. ', ' Clinton will be joined by a roster of influential women — including her collaborators in the report, Melinda Gates and Chelsea Clinton — as she discusses the findings in Manhattan on Monday, marking the 20th anniversary of the United Nations’ Fourth World Conference on Women.

', 'RICK WILSON', ' A joint project of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the Economist Intelligence Unit, UCLA WORLD Policy Analysis Center and Fathom Information Design, the report evaluates the progress women and girls have made over the past two decades in a wide range of areas, from education to health to political influence, and presents data that are often broken down by geography and income. It also looks to the future, emphasizing the importance of continued work on such issues. ', ' “While we have made progress over the past 20 years, not all women and girls have seen these gains in their own lives — and much unfinished business remains,” the 46-page report reads. ', ' The document delves into some policy areas that Clinton has identified as a priority, such as paid maternity leave. It notes that the United States is the sole high-income nation without a national paid leave policy, a fact Clinton often decries.

', ' The report celebrates the fact that over 95 percent of the new national constitutions instituted since the Beijing conference include guarantees of gender equality, but warns that there has been little change in the number of constitutions protecting women’s rights within marriage. ', ' It also looks at education, noting that primary school enrollment rates are now roughly the same for boys and girls worldwide. ', ' Progress has also been made in women’s life expectancies since 1995, but the rise of HIV/AIDS tempers the report’s enthusiasm on this front: “Women’s life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is only 57 years, on average, due in part to the rise of HIV/AIDS. In 2013, 16 million women globally were estimated to be living with HIV — almost twice as many as in 1995,” the highlights document explains.

', ' Still, it lauds the plunge in the maternal mortality rate: Since 1995, the rate of women dying in childbirth has dropped “by at least 40 percent in 76 countries.” ', ' And some of the report’s findings deal directly with issues of political influence, without explicitly acknowledging Clinton’s own ambitions. ', ' “Women occupy 22 percent of seats in national legislatures, up from 12 percent in 1997,” the highlights read. Still, “surveys in many countries show that people still believe men make better political leaders than women.” ', ' At one point the report notes that in 1995 only 12 countries had female heads of state or government, compared to 18 today.

', ' The report uses the word “exacerbate” repeatedly to describe warming’s effect on poverty, lack of water, disease and even the causes of war. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will issue a report next March on how global warming is already affecting the way people live and what will happen in the future, including a worldwide drop in income. A leaked copy of a draft of the summary of the report appeared online Friday on a climate skeptic’s website. Governments will spend the next few months making comments about the draft. ', ' “We’ve seen a lot of impacts and they’ve had consequences,” Carnegie Institution climate scientist Chris Field, who heads the report, told The Associated Press on Saturday. “And we will see more in the future.” ', ' Cities, where most of the world now lives, have the highest vulnerability, as do the globe’s poorest people. ', ' “Throughout the 21st century, climate change impacts will slow down economic growth and poverty reduction, further erode food security and trigger new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger,” the report says. “Climate change will exacerbate poverty in low- and lower-middle income countries and create new poverty pockets in upper-middle to high-income countries with increasing inequality.” ', ' For people living in poverty, the report says, “climate-related hazards constitute an additional burden.” ', ' The report says scientists have high confidence especially in what it calls certain “key risks”: ', ' — People dying from warming- and sea rise-related flooding, especially in big cities. ', ' — Famine because of temperature and rain changes, especially for poorer nations. ', ' — Farmers going broke because of lack of water. ', ' — Infrastructure failures because of extreme weather. ', ' — Dangerous and deadly heat waves worsening. ', ' — Certain land and marine ecosystems failing. ', ' “Human interface with the climate system is occurring and climate change poses risks for human and natural systems,” the 29-page summary says. ', ' None of the harms talked about in the report is solely due to global warming nor is climate change even the No. 1 cause, the scientists say. But a warmer world, with bursts of heavy rain and prolonged drought, will worsen some of these existing effects, they say. ', ' For example, in disease, the report says until about 2050 “climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist” and then it will lead to worse health compared to a future with no further warming. ', ' If emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas continue at current trajectories, “the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year will compromise normal human activities including growing food or working outdoors,” the report says. ', ' Scientists say the global economy may continue to grow, but once the global temperature hits about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than now, it could lead to worldwide economic losses between 0.2 and 2.0 percent of income. ', ' One of the more controversial sections of the report involves climate change and war. ', ' “Climate change indirectly increases risks from violent conflict in the form of civil war, intergroup violence and violent protests by exacerbating well-established drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks,” the report says. ', ' Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t part of the international study team, told the AP that the report’s summary confirms what researchers have known for a long time: “Climate change threatens our health, land, food and water security.” ', ' The summary went through each continent detailing risks and possible ways that countries can adapt to them. ', ' For North America, the highest risks over the long term are from wildfires, heat waves and flooding. Water - too much and too little - and heat are the biggest risks for Europe, South America and Asia, with South America and Asia having to deal with drought-related food shortages. Africa gets those risks and more: starvation, pests and disease. Australia and New Zealand get the unique risk of losing their coral reef ecosystems, and small island nations have to be worried about being inundated by rising seas. ', ' Field said experts paint a dramatic contrast of possible futures, but because countries can lessen some of the harms through reduced fossil fuel emissions and systems to cope with other changes, he said he doesn’t find working on the report depressing. ', ' “The reason I’m not depressed is because I see the difference between a world in which we don’t do anything and a world in which we try hard to get our arms around the problem,” he said.

A full replacement would cost $270 billion, the report says. And the whole proposal immediately ran into GOP skepticism. \n ', ' ', ' The report, from a sprawling Energy Department study called the Quadrennial Energy Review, calls for creating a DOE program to offer states financial incentives to replace and repair their aging infrastructure, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions from distribution lines that carry natural gas to homes and businesses. The price tag would be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over 10 years. \n ', ' ', ' and ', ' POLITICO’s analysis of federal pipeline data found that the older lines are a major part of the problem. Since 2002, about a quarter of all reported pipeline incidents involved failed parts that had been installed before 1970, including 91 incidents in which the parts were at least 80 years old. During the past 12 years, spills, breaks and other accidents from all gas, oil and hazardous liquids pipelines caused a total of more than $5.5 billion in damage. \n ', ' ', ' While the Energy Department has the authority to create the program, it would rely on Congress to approve the money — setting up a clash with Republicans who see little reason to flood the administration with cash to fix a problem that the industry is already touting its progress in tackling. GOP lawmakers quickly bashed the DOE report’s recommendations across the board. \n ', ' ', ' A senior Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it’s “not likely” that the administration would get Congress to sign off on its ambitious pipeline program. Within the industry, the aide said, “they don’t need grants; they need permit and [regulatory] certainty.” \n ', ' ', ' Matt Sparks, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), pointed to three oil and gas infrastructure bills that the chamber has already passed with Democratic support this year, including a measure that President Barack Obama vetoed that would have approved construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. “If the administration is serious about securing our energy future, a good start might be” by working with Republicans on those bills, he said by email. \n ', ' ', ' Still, the administration remains hopeful that it can find a compromise with Congress on a pipeline replacement program that would pay job-creation as well as environmental dividends, particularly as Republicans work on broad energy legislation. “We are eager to engage with Congress and see if we can find common ground,” White House energy and climate adviser Dan Utech told reporters on a conference call earlier Tuesday. “We think this is a really important area for working together.” \n ', ' ', ' Former National Security Council energy adviser Jason Bordoff, the founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said both parties should be able to agree on the administration’s call for addressing “crumbling gas pipelines” and the report’s other recommendations. \n ', ' ', ' “These aren’t things that should be partisan issues,” he said. “It’s obviously hard to come up with money in today’s environment, but these are things that are necessary to do.” \n ', ' ', ' An Energy Department official said DOE will not include the program in its fiscal year 2016 budget request. The department plans to work on designing the program this year and anticipates requesting funding in fiscal year 2017, the official said. \n ', ' ', ' The administration’s proposal would encourage states that are replacing older pipelines to focus their spending on averting electricity rate increases, and lower-income ratepayers would get up to four years of aid to deal with potential price hikes stemming from the replacement program. \n ', ' ', ' That emphasis on lower-income Americans left some in the industry wondering why DOE hopes to create a new way to give electricity rate relief that the government already provides through HHS. \n ', ' ', ' “More than anything, we’re puzzled by this request, because it’s such a convoluted approach when there’s such an obvious solution — funding the documented need in” the HHS Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said an industry source tracking the proposal who addressed it on condition of anonymity. \n ', ' ', ' The Energy Department would set guidelines to evaluate the applications based on their expected benefits to public safety, cost effectiveness and the degree to which the proposal will cut emissions of methane — a greenhouse gas that’s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but over 20 times more potent. \n ', ' ', ' “While I am pleased to see the continued Administration support for natural gas in our clean energy future, it is critical to recognize the significant work already underway, and the contributions current industry efforts are making,” American Gas Association President Dave McCurdy said in a statement on the DOE report. \n ', ' ', ' Green groups that have long pushed for greater government and industry investment in upgrading natural gas pipelines cheered DOE for highlighting the issue. Natural Resources Defense Council senior policy analyst Carl Zichella pointed in an interview to the “huge public safety implication” of a multibillion-dollar program to tackle “aging infrastructure that’s becoming increasingly dangerous.” \n ', ' ', ' Indeed, the DOE report says most natural gas pipeline accidents occur on distribution lines located near dense population centers. Cast-iron and bare-steel pipelines account for 9 percent of the country’s distribution pipelines even while they result in 30 percent of methane emissions from gas distribution systems, the report said. \n ', ' ', ' DOE projects that investments in interstate natural gas pipelines will range between $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion annually over the next 15 years. \n ', ' ', ' Modernizing pipelines also would pay dividends for Obama’s climate agenda, given the propensity for older infrastructure to leak methane. Environmentalists note that one-third of the leaks that persist come from older lines that are prevalent in the northeast, where Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey hailed the DOE report on Tuesday and vowed to reintroduce legislation that would speed up replacement of aging pipes. \n ', ' ', ' N. Jonathan Peress of the Environmental Defense Fund noted in March that although the industry has upgraded almost 40 percent of the most out-of-date pipelines as of 1990, the majority of them are still in operation “and still leaking.” \n ', ' ', ' Rob Jackson, a professor of environmental sciences at Stanford who has studied pipeline infrastructure, called the QER recommendation a “great first step.” \n ', ' ', ' “There are many reasons to repair and replace these old pipelines and climate change, methane emissions, that’s only one reason,” he said in an interview. “Pipeline replacement programs will improve consumer safety, improve air quality and create jobs as well.” \n ', ' ', ' He estimated that a major campaign to replace the country’s aging pipeline infrastructure would take at least 10 to 20 years. \n ', ' ', ' ', ' \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

', ' The Senate Intelligence Committee report finds that the “Enhanced Interrogation Techniques” program escaped effective scrutiny by outsiders long after its inception in 2002, with CIA records showing that President George W. Bush was never briefed by the agency on specific techniques such as waterboarding until 2006. Top Bush administration officials such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell were not told of the practices until September 2003. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The congressional review also says that the CIA’s actual tactics often went far beyond the terms laid out in Justice Department legal opinions, subjecting detainees to prolonged interrogation under a combination of harsh techniques and ignoring safeguards set forth in the legal memos such as ensuring that interrogators were well-trained and had high-level approvals before using the unusually aggressive tactics. ', ' President Barack Obama issued a statement that stopped short of completely endorsing the report’s conclusions, but he reiterated his opposition to the Bush-era interrogation practices. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “The report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects in secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests,” Obama said. “These techniques did significant damage to America’s standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners.” ', ' Obama was silent on the issues of whether the CIA misled outsiders about the program and about whether it produced important intelligence but he emphasized that he banned the harsh techniques soon after he took office ', ' “Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today’s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past,” he said. ', ' Among the report’s key findings: ', ' • Interrogation sessions were far more brutal than publicly revealed and went far beyond the scope of Justice Department approvals. Alleged Al Qaeda organizer Abu Zubaydah was interrogated continuously for 17 consecutive days, being subjected to 183 waterboarding sessions and confinement in stress positions. CIA staffers were prepared to cremate him if he died. During one waterboarding session, Abu Zubaydah lost consciousness and water and air bubbles began pouring out of his mouth. The incident was never reported to senior CIA management, but discovered by the Senate in emails of CIA medical personnel. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' • The CIA had little grip on basic details such as the number of detainees in the program. According to agency records, at least 119 prisoners were involved, but CIA officials represented the number at less that 100. At least a sixth of the prisoners didn’t meet the stated criteria. Sometimes senior officials were confused about where detainees were located. Vice President Dick Cheney at one point ran into diplomatic trouble because he was unaware one country was hosting a so-called black site. ', ' • While Bush has defended the program and taken responsibility for authorizing it, he was apparently told for the first time about the details of the interrogation techniques in 2006. CIA records show that at that briefing he expressed discomfort with the “image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself.” ', ' • Key Cabinet officials such as Powell and Rumsfeld were kept out of the loop about the program until September 2003. An email from CIA acting general counsel John Rizzo said White House staff insisted the reason was to avoid leaks, but Rizzo said it was “clear to us” that National Security Council officials feared Powell “would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what’s going on.” ', ' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) charged that the interrogation tactics amounted to “torture,” although the report itself doesn’t explicitly make that claim. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “The CIA’s actions a decade ago are a stain on our history and our values … Releasing this report is an important step to restore our values and show the world we are in fact a just and lawful society,” she said in a speech on the Senate floor. “This program was morally, legally and administrative misguided … The CIA program was far more brutal than people were led to believe.” ', ' Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday, at POLITICO’s Women Rule Summit, ', ' would strengthen the United States. ', ' “Think about it, name me another country that’s prepared to stand and say, ‘This was a mistake, we should not have done what we‘ve done and we will not do it again,’” Biden said. America will be the stronger for saying, “We made a mistake, we’re exposing it.” ', ' CIA officials say the Senate review is deeply flawed, in large part because the study which formally began in 2009 relied solely on written CIA documents and did not include direct interviews with key players. The spy agency says the Senate report understates the value of intelligence received from detainees and that management problems identified in the report were rectified relatively early in the program. ', '\n  ', ' ', ' CIA Director John Brennan conceded missteps in the agency’s interrogation effort, but sharply disagreed with other conclusions in the report. ', ' “We acknowledge that the detention and interrogation program had shortcomings and that the Agency made mistakes,” the director said. “The most serious problems occurred early on and stemmed from the fact that the agency was unprepared and lacked the core competencies required to carry out an unprecedented, worldwide program of detaining and interrogating suspected al-Qa’ida and affiliated terrorists. ', ' “In carrying out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the American people expect of us,” Brennan added. “As an agency, we have learned from these mistakes.” ', ' Brennan insisted that information obtained through the program headed off deadly terrorist attacks and he rejected the idea that the CIA deliberately covered up its actions. ', ' “Our review indicates that interrogations of detainees on whom EITs were used did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives. The intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of al-Qa’ida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,” the director said. “While we made mistakes, the record does not support the study’s inference that the Agency systematically and intentionally misled each of these audiences on the effectiveness of the program.” ', ' For his part, Obama was silent on the issues of whether the CIA misled outsiders about the program and about whether it produced important intelligence but he emphasized that he banned the harsh techniques soon after he took office. ', ' “Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today’s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past,” Obama said in the White House statement. ', ' In August, Obama said bluntly: “We tortured some folks.” However, he did not explicitly describe the CIA’s Bush-era techniques as torture in his written statement Tuesday. ', ' A senior administration official suggested the omission was an effort to prevent the White House from being drawn into a debate about whether every harsh practice in the report amounted to torture. ', ' “The president has said that we committed torture. He’s been clear on that point for many years,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We’re not going to go case-by-case in a report like this and try to affix a label for each action.” ', ' The president will not address the CIA’s claim that the tactics did produce significant useful intelligence because he has concluded the techniques were wrong and counterproductive in a broader sense regardless of their possible efficacy in specific cases, the senior official said. “We are not going into engage in this debate. That would miss the overriding point,” the official added. ', ' The Intelligence Committee voted in April to declassify the 525-page executive summary of the 6,000-page report but the publication was delayed as lawmakers and the White House debated how to handle sensitive information such as agents’ names and other identifying characteristics. ', ' Led by ranking member Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the Republican members of the committee issued a response Tuesday, challenging the methodology and accuracy of the Democrats’ findings. The Democrats’ “problematic claims and conclusions create the false impression that the CIA was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the program’s operation,” the Republicans said. ', ' Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was held captive and tortured for several years in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, spoke on the Senate floor immediately following Feinstein to voice his support for the report’s release. “I know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will offer more bad information than good,” he said. ', ' The Senate report says the program was built on an order Bush signed six days after Sept. 11. While the order did authorize detention of prisoners, it did not discuss interrogation. ', ' Bush wrote in his memoirs that he knew about the enhanced interrogation program since 2002 and fully supported and approved it. But former CIA Directors George Tenet and Porter Goss told CIA investigators that Bush was not briefed by the agency about the interrogation techniques until 2006. ', ' U.S. military commanders and embassies worldwide have been bracing for possible fallout and security threats because of the release of the report.\xa0 ', ' White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the release “may have an impact” on U.S. interests abroad, but said it’s nonetheless essential for the facts of the Bush administration’s practices to be made public, where possible. ', ' “We want to be sure that we can release that report, be transparent about it and be clear about what American values are and be clear about the fact that the administration believes and that — in a way that’s consistent with American values — that something like this should never happen again,” Earnest said. ', ' But Republicans are worried about the threats that the report’s release may stir up. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said Sunday on CNN that foreign leaders and U.S. intelligence officials have made clear their warnings that the report’s release “will cause violence and deaths.” ', ' Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said in a statement Monday night that the report’s publication “is reckless and irresponsible” given concerns about the international response. “This report does not qualify as either serious or constructive.” ', ' Just after taking office in 2009, Obama signed executive orders ending the use of controversial Bush-era interrogation techniques and floated the idea of conducting a public accounting of the practices of his predecessor’s administration. But the review released Tuesday came not from the Obama administration but ', ' ', ', and after administration officials engaged in a months-long tug-of-war over what would be made public. ', ' The White House has said that Obama “strongly supports” making the report public, but the CIA and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough have been wrangling for months with Feinstein to limit details that Democratic senators say are crucial to understanding the narrative of the program. ', ' “Without the leadership of [Intelligence panel chair] Sen. Feinstein and her determination and the support of Democrats on the committee, there’s no chance that this would see the light of day,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Monday. ', ' Resistance from the administration included Secretary of State John Kerry’s Friday call to Feinstein, in which he asked her to “consider” the timing of the release “because a lot is going on in the world, and [Kerry] wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing,” State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. ', ' The CIA tapped into a computer network used by the Senate Intelligence Committee and read the emails of staffers involved in the interrogation investigation, ', ' this summer concluded. Feinstein first revealed knowledge of the ', ', saying that the conflict between her panel and the CIA reflected “a defining moment for the oversight of our intelligence community.” ', ' The Intelligence Committee’s Democratic majority voted in April to declassify the summary and time had almost run out before Tuesday’s release, since the panel’s incoming chair, Sen.

', 'Story Continued Below', ' The Department of Veterans Affairs reported that 85 percent to 100 percent of vets were getting in for mental health appointments in El Paso within 14 days. But the Democratic congressman found that, on average, it took 71 days to see a mental health care provider and more than 36 percent of the veterans in the study saw no care giver at all. The results have prompted him to call for a similar independent survey of VA patients nationwide. ', ' “What everyone learned in Phoenix, and from [VA’s] report last Wednesday, is that you cannot trust the VA to tell us how the VA is doing,” O’Rouke told POLITICO. ', ' There are many ideas for how Congress might reform the agency, he said, “but right now we can’t because we’re working with fake numbers from the VA.” ', ' The findings add new color and detail to what former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki acknowledged were “systemic problems” with the agency, which prompted him to resign on Friday. Much of the attention in the scandal has so far focused on the Phoenix VA center, but investigators have said all along that VA’s problems weren’t just confined there. ', ' Meanwhile, Shinseki’s acting replacement, Sloan Gibson, met for the first time with a group of veterans’ service organizations Wednesday morning. He told them VA has reached out to nearly all of the 1,700 vets in the Phoenix area who hadn’t made it into the local scheduling system, and that he would fly out there personally on Thursday. ', ' It didn’t take long for Gibson’s first kerfuffle as the new director of the VA to occur. The vets’ groups he met with included the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and other groups — but not two that have tangled with the agency, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America or Concerned Veterans of America. ', ' Shortly after reporters pointed out on Twitter that those groups hadn’t been in the meeting, IAVA CEO Paul Rieckhoff posted his own update. “Maybe @DeptVetAffairs follows you on Twitter,” he wrote. “@IAVA & I JUST got an email to meet w Acting Sec Sloan Gibson Monday.” ', ' Gibson’s longer-term outlook at VA was not clear. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the White House was considering nominating the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, Delos Cosgrove, to take over the VA. Should that happen, and if the White House and the Senate move quickly on confirmation, Gibson could once again become the department’s deputy secretary.

', ' But Holder, who began his stormy five-plus-year tenure at the Justice Department with his controversial “Nation of Cowards” speech, has chosen what seems to be the ideal (and maybe the ', ') moment to call it quits after more than 18 months of musing privately about leaving with the president and senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, a trio bound by friendship, progressive ideology and shared African-American ancestry. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' It was now or never, several current and former administration officials say, and Holder – under pressure to retire from a physician wife worried about a recent health scare, checked the ""now"" box. “It was a quit-now or never-quit moment,” one former administration official said. “You didn’t want confirmation hearings in 2015 if the Republicans control the Senate. So if he didn’t do it now, there was no way he could ever do it.” ', ' Holder—described by associates as President Obama’s “heat shield” on race and civil rights—sprung it on the president over the Labor Day holidays. Obama didn’t bother to push back as he has in the past, even though staffers say he winces at the prospect of a long confirmation battle, whomever he chooses for the nation’s top law enforcement job. ', ' Holder’s announcement gives Obama several weeks to pick and vet a successor who would face confirmation hearings in the lame-duck session after the midterms. Holder has “agreed to remain in his post until the confirmation of his successor,” a top Justice Department aide said, as an insurance policy against GOP foot-dragging. ', ' His timing also has a personal dimension. The keenly legacy-conscious Holder has never been in better standing, leaving on arguably the highest personal note of his tenure, after a year of progress on his plan to reform sentencing laws and just after his well-received, calming-the-waters trip to Ferguson, Missouri, during the riots in August. In a background email to reporters, a senior Justice Department official struck a victory-lap tone, writing, “The Attorney General’s tenure has been marked by historic gains in the areas of criminal justice reform and civil rights enforcement. The last week alone has seen several announcements related to these signature issues.” ', ' That’s a striking contrast to the defensive posture of the last few years, when Holder became the first sitting Cabinet official to be found in contempt of Congress. Hill Republicans, who have warred with Holder for years, greeted his departure with don’t-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out glee. “I welcome the news that Eric Holder will step down as Attorney General,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, in an email.\xa0“From Operation Fast and Furious to his misleading testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the Department’s dealings with members of the media and his refusal to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS’ targeting of conservative groups, Mr. Holder has consistently played partisan politics with many of the important issues facing the Justice Department.” ', ' *** ', ' ', ' there’s no obvious replacement, several officials close to the situation told me. W. Neil Eggleston, the new White House counsel, will lead the search with an assist from Jarrett, Holder’s longtime ally and defender. Obama and his team would probably prefer a known and trusted quantity—like Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a potential future Democratic presidential candidate who served as the head of the department’s civil rights division under Bill Clinton. But Patrick, who is friends with Obama insiders like David Axelrod, who still advises his old boss informally, has repeatedly told them he’s not interested, and – for now—he seems to mean it. When asked by reporters today, Patrick snapped, “I am going to finish my term and then head into the private sector.” ', ' Paul J. Richards/ AFP/Getty Images ', ' Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, Jr. is a favorite of Obama’s, and a person valued as a team player inside the West Wing—not as widely known but someone who might have an inside track, thanks to Obama’s penchant for picking trusted insiders over high-profile outsiders. But liberal critics have faulted Verilli for his halting performance defending the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court, as well as his mixed scorecard overall. ', ' In recent days the president’s team has also taken a close look at California Attorney General Kamala Harris, an African-American woman who would likely pursue the same civil rights agenda championed by Holder—but may opt to stay in her state to pursue gubernatorial ambitions. ', 'By DOUG MCADAM and KARINA KLOOS', 'By GLENN THRUSH', ' Other names under consideration, but considered less likely, according to check-ins with half a dozen current and former West Wingers: Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan known for his aggressive Wall Street prosecutions; Ron Machen, the young U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C.—a job once held by Holder; Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a former state attorney general; former Joe Biden aide Neil MacBride, an ex-federal prosecutor in Virginia who is now a partner at the law firm Davis Polk; ex-White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, another Obama favorite; and Labor Secretary Tom Perez, another former head of the civil rights division—and currently the only Latino candidate mentioned by insiders. ', ' There’s also at least one high-profile long-shot on the informal list being circulated inside Obama’s camp: former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who left Washington in 2013 to take over the massive University of California system, according to one Democrat with close ties to the White House. Napolitano was the original choice for the job at the start of Obama’s first term – a favorite of then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Holder, who had considered himself the sole front-runner for the job, was startled during the 2008-09 transition period when he was handed a Department of Justice binder that included headshots of himself and Napolitano as potential AGs.

', ' and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.', 'Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind.', 'Story Continued Below', 'President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.', 'But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.', '“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”', 'Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.', '“He\'s brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He\'s going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""', 'It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.', 'Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.', '“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.', 'Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies.

Democrats had their own hawkish ', 'until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.', 'In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though ', ' show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can ', ' of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.', 'It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a ', ' for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.', 'But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.', '“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.', '“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”', '***', 'For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?', '“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.', ""“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang."", '“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.', 'He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.', '“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.', '“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.', '“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.', 'It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.', '“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”', '***', 'Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.', 'Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.', '“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”', ""He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself."", '“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”', '“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”', '***', 'As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.', 'At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.', '“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”', 'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.', 'The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.', 'One of his final ', ' of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.', '“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”', '***', 'Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.', '“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”', 'But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.', 'During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in ', ', Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.”', '***', 'Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.', '“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”', 'But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.', '“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”', '“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”', 'Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.', '“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.', 'On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.', 'Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.', '“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”', '***', 'Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.', 'House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.', 'His advice: Eyes on the prize.', '“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Those trends have kept wages from rising faster, the report says, even though productivity has been high over the past two decades. \n ', ' ', ' And Obama’s economic advisers say the report shows why congressional Republicans shouldn’t try to return to deep spending cuts in their next budget — noting that the easing of sequestration cuts last year, along with a big increase in consumer spending, was one of the reasons the economy grew by 2.8 percent in 2013 and 2014, 0.7 percentage points faster than in Obama’s first term. \n ', ' ', ' “I think one of the reasons you saw higher growth in 2014 was the reduction in austerity and manufactured crises,” Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters at a briefing Wednesday.

Tom Coburn charged in a report released on Tuesday. \n ', ' ', ' The deaths, which occurred over a 10-year period, resulted from VA officials prescribing unneeded and unmonitored painkillers to veterans, delayed treatment that caused cancer to go undetected and veterans waiting at times for months for procedures, the report found. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “More than 1,000 veterans needlessly died under the VA’s watch, and the Department in turn paid these veterans’ families $200 million in wrongful death settlements — the median payment per victim was $150,000,” the report states. \n ', ' ', ' The investigation into ongoing issues at the VA also found that a doctor was able to perform “unnecessary pelvic and breast exams” on female patients, that minority employees faced racial discrimination and that illegal drugs were prevalent in VA facilities. \n ', ' ', ' The report “shows the problems at the VA are worse than anyone imagined. The scope of the VA’s incompetence — and Congress’ indifferent oversight — is breathtaking and disturbing,” said Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and physician who once worked in the VA system. \n ', ' ', ' Coburn is one of Congress’ most ardent investigators of government waste and abuse. The top Republican on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Coburn launched this investigation more than a year ago. \n ', ' ', ' The VA said Tuesday the majority of its employees are dedicated to their work but did not specifically address the charges in Coburn’s report. \n ', ' ', ' “The vast majority of VA employees are dedicated public servants who demonstrate genuine passion to care for veterans and their families every day. At VA, we depend on the service of VA employees and leaders who place the interests of veterans above and beyond self-interest,” the statement said. \n ', ' ', ' The report details chilling instances of racism, abuse and neglect at VA facilities across the country. \n ', ' ', ' In one instance, in Waco, Texas, a noose was placed on the desk of a minority employee, which prompted the VA to conclude that there “was credence to claims of racism and that management in Waco never took measures to stop it,” according to the report. \n ', ' ', ' A male doctor in Kansas was forced to register as a sex offender after five female patients accused him of performing inappropriate breast and pelvic exams, while a social worker in Oregon was placed on administrative leave after her affair with a veteran under her care was discovered. In both instances, the VA officials continued to receive pay while on leave. \n ', ' ', ' These newest allegations are added trouble for the department, which is facing heavy criticism for extensive wait times for veterans seeking medical care, a scandal that forced then-Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. \n ', ' ', ' Coburn’s report shed light on one reason why veterans seeking medical care at VA facilities may be stuck on prolonged wait lists: VA doctors are seeing fewer patients than their private-sector peers. \n ', ' ', ' The average primary care physician in the private sector works about 2,300 cases a year, while a VA doctor sees 1,200. \n ', ' ', ' “By late 2013, the VA had still not developed an adequate and comprehensive way of measuring physician productivity and determining staffing needs,” the report said. \n ', ' ', ' That has helped prompt nearly $850 million in malpractice claims against the VA. Coburn found 167 claims where the families of the veterans discussed the “delay in treatment” to describe the malpractice — costing the agency $36 million. \n ', ' ', ' The report also slams the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee for being “AWOL” — a military term that means absent without official leave — on the ongoing problems at the VA. \n ', ' ', ' “While it is good that Congress feels a sense of urgency, we are at this point because Congress has ignored or glossed over too many similar warnings in the past. Our sense of urgency should come from the scope of the problem, not our proximity to an election,” Coburn said. \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

0,McAuliffe: No favoritism sought from DHS,"['\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN', '\n                    Updated ', 'As a congressional committee prepares to ask questions about a scathing report on political favoritism in a federal visa program, one of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s brothers, Tony Rodham, remained mum Wednesday about accusations that an investment firm he runs pressured a Homeland Security official to speed up action on their business requests. ', ' Meanwhile, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.), who was also a focus of the inspector general report, issued a statement through a spokesman that didn’t dispute the basic facts the Department of Homeland Security watchdog found. Instead, the governor’s team said he was simply pressing the agency to speed up slow decisions on complex petitions related to the arrangements designed to allow foreigners to win green cards by investing in U.S. business ventures. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “This report demonstrates that Governor McAuliffe, along with many other bipartisan individuals and businesses, asked DHS to fulfill its obligation to adjudicate the applications that were before them in a timely fashion,” McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said in a statement. ', ' The report describes McAuliffe as intervening repeatedly with then-U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas to press for approval of various petitions pending for Gulf Coast Funds Management, which is run by Rodham. The calls took place before McAuliffe became governor and appeared intended to benefit an electric car firm tied to the veteran Democratic operative and fundraiser, GreenTech Automotive. ', ' While Mayorkas denied any impropriety, he offered colorful descriptions of McAuliffe’s lobbying. ', ' “I recall that over the course of many months I received several voice messages from Mr. McAuliffe complaining about USCIS’s handling of the GC/GTA case. The messages were caustic. I remember in particular one voice message that I played for [redacted], as it was laced with expletives at a high volume,” Mayorkas said in a written statement to investigators. ', ' Asked about Mayorkas’ description of profanity-laden calls, Coy said Wednesday night: “My understanding is that after nearly two years trying to get just a yes or no answer on these applications, [McAuliffe] was understandably frustrated by the lack of progress.” ', ' The inspector general report said agency investigators spoke with numerous whistle-blowers who complained about special treatment in the so-called EB-5 visa process for applicants with political connections. The report also says investigators failed in their efforts to gather information from relevant parties outside the federal government. ', ' “We made several attempts to interview key external EB-5 stakeholders, many of whom declined to speak with us,” the report said. ', ' McAuliffe’s spokesman confirmed he declined to speak with investigators, but was willing to provide them with any records or details they needed. ', ' “We were asked after he was inaugurated to do a voluntary interview, his counsel replied that he would be happy to provide any information they needed but would not be available for the voluntary interview,” Coy said. ', ' McAuliffe remained out of the public eye Wednesday. His public schedule called for him to attend an infrastructure investment roundtable at the White House complex. The event was closed to reporters, but Coy said the governor was there. ', ' McAuliffe seems likely to speak to the inspector general report directly Thursday for the first time as he faces an “Ask The Governor” program on a Richmond radio station. ', ' Another prominent Democrat scrutinized in the report — former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell — stepped forward Wednesday with a similar explanation of why he was pressing Homeland Security officials so vigorously on similar applications. ', ' Rendell acknowledged that he called Mayorkas “on a number of occasions” to complain about sluggish agency responses. ', ' “They were just not getting answers,” Rendell said Wednesday in a conference call his office organized with reporters. “I would call Director Mayorkas and say, ‘Alejandro, [a USCIS office in] California is being painfully slow. Can they get an answer one way or another?’ … We never asked Alejandro to do anything other than speed up the decision-making process.” ', ' The House Homeland Security Committee is slated Thursday morning to question Inspector General John Roth, whose report details how Mayorkas reacted to repeated phone calls and emails demanding expedited agency reviews. McAuliffe, Rodham and Rendell are not on the witness list. ', ' Rendell said he made such several calls on behalf of an investment consortium called CanAm, which was involved in several projects including financing the expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia and for film production efforts. Rendell said he made some calls on the visa-program issue while governor and became a consultant for the company after leaving office — an arrangement which continues. ', ' “I think six months after I was out of office, Tom Rosenfeld, who’s the CEO of CanAm, asked me to come on as a consultant, and I said that I would because I believe in the program and I knew the type of work that CanAm did,” Rendell said. ', ' Rendell also said he had not talked with McAuliffe about any of the visa-related projects but did raise the issue with several members of Congress and their staffs. ', ' Rendell said he had not read the inspector general report, but he was disappointed the investigators never contacted him. “They never reached out to me in any way,” the former governor said. ', ' The inspector general’s report references Rendell by name 25 times but doesn’t say specifically to whom investigators reached out for interviews or information. ', ' An inspector general spokesman did not respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on Rendell’s claim that investigators never contacted him. ', ' Rendell said the program was deeply flawed because business proposals that passed muster in one part of the country were rejected in others. Mayorkas, who was confirmed in late 2013 as deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said in his response to the IG report that some of the actions he took were aimed at improving the consistency of decisions. ', ' “The program was a mess and disorganized, and one of the problems was they were applying different standards in different regions and the regions made the initial decision,” Rendell said. He said that instead of routing investment money to private firms, the program should be reformed to direct to a national infrastructure bank the $500,000 foreigners need to invest for a green card. He also urged that the program be moved under the Commerce Department. ', ' Rodham did not respond to emails and telephone messages left at Gulf Coast’s Tysons Corner office. ', ' While Republicans jumped on the report as clear evidence of political favors being handed out at DHS, some Democrats insisted the review actually underscored Mayorkas’s leadership skills. ', ' “The inspector general provided no definitive determination of wrongdoing and instead found that Deputy Secretary Mayorkas’ hands-on and reform-minded leadership style may have been misinterpreted by some at USCIS,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security panel. “It seems apparent that Deputy Secretary Mayorkas gave the program attention and put reforms into place. This window into his leadership style is informative and revealing — it paints a picture of an advocate and manager who demanded reform and responsiveness from his agency.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

I do what I think is right.” ', ' McAuliffe also emphasized that the contacts with USCIS took place before he was sworn in early last year. ', ' “I’m a private businessman — not an elected official,” at the time,” McAuliffe said.

Terry McAuliffe is one of a handful of people who allegedly received special treatment from the Department of Homeland Security.', 'A Department of Homeland Security watchdog report issued Tuesday blasted the agency’s No. 2 official for repeatedly intervening on behalf of well-connected participants in an investor-visa program, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) and Tony Rodham, a brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ', ' The inspector general report faults Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas for creating “an appearance of favoritism and special access” as a result of highly unusual steps he took while serving as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversaw the investment-based program known as EB-5. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “Mayorkas communicated with stakeholders on substantive issues, outside of the normal adjudicatory process and intervened with the career USCIS staff in ways that benefited the stakeholders,” Inspector General John Roth wrote. “In … three instances, but for Mr. Mayorkas’s intervention, the matter would have been decided differently.” ', ' In a 32-page written statement made public along with the 65-page report, Mayorkas adamantly denied wrongdoing. “I respectfully submit that a complete and total repudiation of the allegations against me is the only correct and just conclusion,” he told investigators in January. ', ' However, a press statement Mayorkas released Tuesday was slightly more conciliatory. “While I disagree with the Inspector General’s report, I will certainly learn from it and from this process,” he said. “As the leader of U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services, I had the responsibility to ensure that cases, including the three that are the focus of the report, were decided as the law required and that agency errors were corrected.” ', ' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Tuesday that he has “full confidence” in Mayorkas, but that Mayorkas and others need to be cautious about intervening in specific cases. ', 'PAUL S. RYAN', ' “Each of us in leadership must be mindful that, when we become involved in individual matters that happen to reach our desk, we risk the appearance of preferential treatment and the suspicion of our subordinates. As public servants, we must maintain the trust and confidence of all those around us, and be above reproach,” Johnson said in a statement. “I have discussed this with Deputy Secretary Mayorkas and I am confident he understands this.” ', ' Mayorkas’s involvement in a McAuliffe-backed effort to win funds for a fledgling electric car company called GreenTech Automotive became an issue of contention when McAuliffe mounted a successful bid for the Virginia governorship in 2013. The inspector general report cites that as one case in which USCIS employees believed political influence was at work. ', ' “Mayorkas intervened in an administrative appeal related to the denial of a regional center’s application to receive EB-5 funding to manufacture electric cars through investments in a company in which Terry McAuliffe was the board chairman,” the IG report said. “The intervention was unprecedented and, because of the political prominence of the individuals involved, was well as USCIS’s traditional deference to its administrative appeals process, staff perceived it as politically motivated.” ', ' The report also draws attention to the role played by Rodham, who ran an EB-5 visa investment known as Gulf Coast Funds Management, which directed funds to GreenTech. Rodham’s sister was secretary of state during much of the time that Gulf Coast and GreenTech were pressing USCIS for approvals to accept investments that could lead to green cards for foreigners willing to front up more than $550,000 in principal and fees. ', ' Rodham wrote directly to Mayorkas in January 2013 about approval delays, the report said, and Mayorkas forwarded the email to other staffers “with a ‘high importance’ designation.” ', ' The report explores possible discrepancies in accounts of a February 2011 meeting involving Mayorkas and McAuliffe. Mayorkas told investigators he was in a “listen-only mode” at the meeting, but four months after the meeting McAuliffe emailed another DHS official complaining: “We were promised by the Director that our application would receive an expedited review.” ', ' The report said one employee at the meeting wrote in an email after a July 2011 meeting that Mayorkas “noted several times that these cases are affiliated with ‘people of influence’ and ‘people with money’ and he has several more of these on his radar.” ', ' Mayorkas told investigators in an interview that he didn’t remember making such statements, that they sounded “absurd,” and that he was “impervious to pressure.” He argued more broadly that the EB-5 program, aimed at awarding green cards to foreign investors who invest $500,000 in a rural or impoverished area while creating at least 10 jobs, was badly managed and that those involved at the immigration service were making inconsistent decisions on applications. ', ' A spokesman for McAuliffe did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The report says investigators “were unsuccessful in [their] attempts to interview McAuliffe.” He dropped his investment and role in GreenTech in 2012 before launching his gubernatorial bid. ', ' Email messages and phone messages to Rodham on Tuesday through the Virginia office of Gulf Coast were not immediately returned. ', ' The IG report also faulted Mayorkas’s involvement in EB-5 investment projects that drew the interest of two other prominent Democrats: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell. ', ' The report says Reid and Mayorkas spoke about a Las Vegas casino-and-hotel development effort in January 2013. Mayorkas said he promised nothing beyond a “fresh look” at the issue. However, USCIS staffers say they were told that the director had agreed to provide weekly updates to Reid’s staff on the status of the petitions. ', ' Reid spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said Reid was proud of his advocacy for the casino project, known as SLS. ', ' “Senator Reid’s work helped get SLS built and created thousands of Nevada jobs. SLS Las Vegas has revitalized the North end of the Las Vegas Strip and with the coming addition of the Genting Resort the area will continue to grow. … Senator Reid considers it part of his basic responsibility as Nevada’s senator to ensure that projects that benefit Nevada get fair and timely consideration from the federal government,” Orthman said. “Senator Reid will always put Nevada first and fight for Nevada jobs.” ', ' The report claims Mayorkas spoke with Rendell in 2011 and 2012 as USCIS worked on applications related to efforts to obtain investor visas through financing of movies. ', ' Mayorkas said he initially spoke to Rendell at the request of the office of then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and that Rendell complained that USCIS’s mishandling of applications was “costing Pennsylvania the investment of funds and the creation of jobs.” ', ' Mayorkas said that after the first call he looked into the matter with his staff. He could not recall the second call with Rendell, the report said. ', ' Rendell did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment on the report. ', ' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) issued a statement Tuesday calling the report “extremely concerning” and announcing that he will hold a hearing Thursday to explore the issue. ', ' Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the findings raise concerns about Obama’s decision to name Mayorkas last year as the deputy secretary at DHS. ', ' “Digging into the report and reading about specific cases, you can see just how questionable Mr. Mayorkas’ ethics and judgment were. And, just as bad, is the blind eye that the Obama administration turned when elevating this individual to the number two slot at the Department of Homeland Security,” Grassley said. “The sheer number of whistleblowers who came forward is a darn good indication as to how bad things were at the agency.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

I think there are some communities that have to do some soul searching,” Obama said. “But I think we as a country have to do some soul searching.

It is not a statement,” Obama said. “It’s a handful of people taking advantage of the situation for their own purposes, and they need to be treated as criminals.” ', ' But he said the deeper problem is a lack of education opportunities for many kids and a criminal justice system that is a “pipeline from schools to prisons.” ', ' Baltimore on Tuesday remained on edge after rioting swept through its streets starting Monday afternoon, following the funeral of Freddie Gray, who died from spinal injuries he didn’t have before he was taken into custody by the police in Baltimore. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the circumstances around his death. ', ' The White House has been in touch with both Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who have struggled to contain the unrest and fielded criticism for not deploying more law enforcement earlier to head off the violence.

', ' There weren’t a lot of firm recommendations from the 11 people whom Obama appointed after last year’s uproar in Ferguson, Missouri, to give him an interim report on 21st Century Policing last month (No. 1 recommendation: “Law enforcement culture should embrace a guardian mindset to build public trust and legitimacy”). They skipped over body cameras. They skipped over racial bias training. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' They did recommend the creation of another task force, this one called the National Crime and Justice Task Force. ', ' Congress managed to do even less. ', ' Since then, Walter Scott was shot five times in the back by a police officer in North Charleston, S.C., and Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries he didn’t have before he was taken into custody by the police in Baltimore, which burst into riots and looting Monday, right in the middle of the day. ', ' With a dozen incidents in a year and a half, all around the country, the frustrations appear to transcend local conditions. And though local officials keep blaming round-the-clock cable news coverage for encouraging the violence, the speed and intensity of the protests in city after city make clear how much deeper than police misconduct these frustrations are — joblessness, hopelessness, racial double standards. ', ' “It’s a state of emergency of tremendous proportions,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. “The response you’re having is not about the incidents. The response is about lack of faith in the political system to adequately respond to what we’re dealing with here.” ', ' Black men are the ones getting killed, but this isn’t just about the black community, or something that confronts Obama because he’s black. ', ' “This is more of an issue of the presidency, than an issue of the president who happens to be black,” Morial said. ', ' Obama and Congress are busy arguing over the Iran nuclear negotiations, a trade deal, what could become the broadest climate change agreement in history. But each city that erupts is a reminder of how little’s been done to address what’s hitting Americans in communities across the country much more immediately. ', ' “We’re in the throes of a national crisis,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “People are looking at our system of criminal justice and our system of law enforcement and they recognize that something is wrong.” ', ' The president’s response has been constrained, both by the need to avoid prejudicing any federal legal action and because of a political environment that pins him between those who think he needs to say more on behalf of African-Americans and those who think anything he says about African-Americans shows his bias in their favor. ', ' Last summer, when he said nearly nothing to satisfy the people chanting in the streets, he still had critics complaining he wasn’t doing enough to back up the police. On Monday, he called Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to offer support, and his top adviser Valerie Jarrett spoke with Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. A few hours later, Rawlings-Blake instituted a week-long curfew and asked Hogan to send in the National Guard. ', ' “This is fundamentally a local issue,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Monday, adding that while the president’s policing task force made some important recommendations, “there does need to be a commitment from local elected leaders and local law enforcement leaders to confront this challenge and to demonstrate some determination about trying to build bridges with the citizens that they’re sworn to protect.” ', ' Meanwhile, 15 police officers were injured. Two were still in the hospital Monday night. Stores in West Baltimore were looted and destroyed. ', '\n  ', ' ', ' “I condemn the senseless acts of violence,” said Loretta Lynch, in the first statement she issued since being sworn in as attorney general Monday morning, right after leaving her post as the United States attorney in the New York district where Eric Garner was choked to death. The Staten Island district attorney failed to get a grand jury to indict the police officer involved. ', ' Obama himself has backed the use of police body cameras, and his budget proposal provides $97 million to provide them, in addition to millions more for the Justice Department. The White House has also been pressing a meeting convened at the beginning of April on increasing data access as evidence of the follow through to the March 1 task force report. ', ' After all, they’ve only had the task force’s recommendations for a few weeks, the White House says. ', ' “Right now, agencies have been reviewing to see how they can actively support the report and implement the recommendations,” said a White House official. “In the interim, it is clear that there are some actions that can be taken in the near term — and that’s what the Police Data Initiative was an example of.” ', ' Federal action has its limits. With few exceptions, police are under state or local authority, and even a much more active Obama and Congress could only force some reforms. But advocates say that the impact of legislation increasing police accountability alone would be significant. ', ' People “understand that they will be held responsible for looting, but there’s a tacit understanding that when law enforcement assaults or kills somebody, they will not be,” Ifill said. ', ' PHOTO GALLERY: Riots rock Baltimore ', '\n  ', ' ', ' Changing that requires moving beyond task forces and conversations that only come up every time another black man’s killed and the national media runs to another city to for a few days of coverage on the ground, Ifill said. Obama needs to address the problem, she said, Congress needs to address it, and everyone running for president needs to do so, as well. ', ' “This is not something that can be put to the side and ghettoized,” she said. ', ' Monday night in Baltimore, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts was looking out at his burning city and raising the specter of Watts. ', ' “I don’t know if it’s going to get worse,” Batts admitted, as he tried to end his late night press conference. ', ' Obama will have a press conference Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He’ll have the White House press corps and national cameras focused on him to hear him if he chooses to say more about what’s going on in Baltimore and around the country. ', ' “Look at the attention the Iran nuclear issue is getting from Congress, and from the beltway media. There’s a sense that this is isolated and it’ll blow over,” Morial said. “This is a problem of national proportions and national dimensions.” ', ' “It’s Baltimore today,” Morial said. “Who will be next?” ', ' ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Ten DEA agents later admitted attending the parties, and some of the agents received suspensions of two to 10 days.

DEA supervisors, however, had been aware of the allegations for several years because of complaints from management of the building in which the DEA office in Bogotá was located. ', ' “Although some of the DEA agents participating in these parties denied it, the information in the case file suggested they should have known the prostitutes in attendance were paid with cartel funds. A foreign officer also alleged providing protection for the DEA agents’ weapons and property during the parties,” the report said. “The foreign officers further alleged that in addition to soliciting prostitutes, three DEA SSAs [special agents] in particular were provided money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.” ', ' The IG’s office asserts that DEA officials did not fully comply with their requests for information during the probe. ', ' “We were also concerned by an apparent decision by DEA to withhold information regarding a particular open misconduct case,” the report states. “The OIG [Office of Inspector General] was not given access to this case file information until several months after our request, and only after the misconduct case was closed. Once we became aware of the information, we interviewed DEA employees who said that they were given the impression that they were not to discuss this case with the OIG while the case remained open.” ', ' The report adds: “Therefore, we cannot be completely confident that the FBI and DEA provided us with all information relevant to this review. As a result, our report reflects the findings and conclusions we reached based on the information made available to us.” ', ' Spokespersons for DEA and ATF said the agencies would not comment on the report and referred all questions to the Justice Department.

He made no mention of the incidents that led some in Congress to call for her resignation.

Leonhart has been in the DEA’s top leadership position since late 2007, first in an acting capacity and then as a confirmed appointee starting in 2010.

The IG also said DEA personnel were not initially forthcoming with all records related to the episodes.

The IG’s report exposed the bad behavior that was allowed to fester for more than a decade, and our Committee’s hearing shined a spotlight on the lack of accountability for these abuses. This process is strong evidence of how proper and bipartisan oversight can lead to a better functioning government for the citizens it serves.” ', ' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) also stepped forward to express approval of Leonhart’s departure.

', ' “This news follows hearings about sexual misconduct by agents in Colombia that took place over a decade ago. However, that is not what is causing her departure. This is about her courage to enforce the law,” ex-DEA Administrator Peter Bensinger said.

0,"Pressure builds on GOP for police, criminal justice reforms","['\n                        ', '\n                        Facing calls from within the party, Republican leaders signal they’re open to considering legislation.', '\n                    By ', '\n                Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is pushing for more body cameras.', 'Pressure is mounting on Republican congressional leaders to take up criminal justice and police reform legislation — and the calls are increasingly coming from within the GOP. ', ' Republican leaders haven’t yet decided how to proceed on an issue conservatives typically have not treated as a priority. But with outrage over police killings of African-Americans dominating the news, an increasing number of rank-and-file GOP lawmakers say doing nothing is no longer an option. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' Sheriff-turned-Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.) wants Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to set up a new select committee on the issue. Sen. Tim Scott, a black South Carolina senator, is pushing for more body cameras. And Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) is eyeing a commission to study problem areas in criminal justice. ', ' “We have an emergency here and we need to address it,” Reichert said. “This has got to be a priority otherwise this country is going to collapse into some serious chaos in our cities — not just between police and community, but divided by race, divided by economic status.” ', ' The call to action marks a change of course for Republicans, who have favored a hands-off approach to policing in the past. Some conservatives, though, are wary of meddling in state and local law enforcement. They also fear alienating police constituencies who risk their lives as public servants. ', ' But between the Baltimore and Ferguson riots, the shooting of an unarmed African-American fleeing a cop during a traffic stop in South Carolina, and the retaliatory murder of several officers by citizens, many GOP lawmakers say more needs to be done than just one or two congressional hearings. ', ' “We do not want to take over law enforcement responsibilities,” said Scott, who argues congressional involvement is preventative rather than a departure from conservative orthodoxy. “But if you see a consistent pattern that is not in one city, and not in one state, but is nationwide … does that provide a federal nexus to helping? … My answer is yes.” ', ' There’s no shortage of ideas from members. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is considering a reduction in mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. And staff on the panel have had discussions about the possibility of lowering the threshold for the Justice Department to initiate a civil rights case, including in cases in which someone died in police custody. ', ' Cornyn, a former judge and Texas attorney general, is mulling a nationwide commission to study problem areas in law enforcement. ', ' “We are doing a great disservice to ourselves and to everyone else so clearly frustrated by the status quo if we isolate Baltimore or Ferguson as just individual instances of civic unrest … if we don’t step back and see how they fit into the broader issue of our entire criminal justice system,” Cornyn said on the Senate floor Wednesday. ', ' The Senate’s No. 2 Republican was advocating for a criminal justice overhaul. In addition to the bill to start a national commission, he’s sponsoring bipartisan legislation to allow well-behaved prisoners to earn time off their sentences. ', ' It’s a different take on another proposal floated by President Barack Obama and Republicans alike: reducing mandatory minimum sentences on nonviolent drug related crimes, which are cited as one of the major reasons many black men from urban settings end up behind bars. ', ' Leadership is listening but has not committed to a course of action. Boehner on TV last week, for example, retorted, “Why not?” when asked if the federal government should “chip in” for body cameras. ', ' Leaders in both chambers are waiting to see what their top law enforcement legislators say first. Both Judiciary Committees are already discussing what needs to be done and are scheduling hearings for the next few weeks. ', ' Another big-ticket reform idea gaining traction more recently, thanks to Scott: giving localities more money to purchase body cameras. ', ' “I think it is important that the resources be there for the best solutions in local areas, in terms of things like body cameras that we’ve seen that can help significantly,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), another member of Senate Republican leadership. “We need to make sure that if communities move in that direction, they have the resources to do so.” ', ' Scott points to studies suggesting the use of force decreases when cameras are present. ', ' Police like Reichert also like the idea, suggesting the evidence works both ways and could help protect police from accusations of wrongdoing. ', ' Getty image ', '\n  ', ' ', ' The problem is financing, according to James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, one of the biggest cop advocacy groups in Washington. The group backs the idea of body cameras, it’s just a question of who’s going to pick up the tab. And though the Justice Department last week pledged to give $20 million to police departments to fund the pricey technology, Pasco says it’s not enough. ', ' “Cameras are coming and rightfully so … The problem is: Where is the money going to come from?” he asked. ', ' There are also policy questions around body cameras, including when they should be turned on: Should they be used during domestic dispute calls, for example? Would that keep victims from calling for help? And there’s also an issue of public information: When can people request copies of such videos? ', ' Reichert says Congress needs to help resolve these issues: “Federal law enforcement has to have a role in helping and working with law enforcement to raise their standards and meet standards that are set by the federal government … We can set up a national standard we think should be met.” ', ' He and Scott noted that funding could be tied to certain requirements for its usage, as state and local money typically is — and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. ', ' But they’ve got conservative skeptics to convince. ', ' Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), when asked about body cameras, said: “I’m in favor of it but I don’t know what more we can do here other than provide funding, but we shouldn’t have to do that.” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R- Ala.) echoed Flake’s comment: “We don’t have the money.” ', ' Federal legislation on police issues challenges conservative principles, Sen. Pat Toomey explained, just minutes after giving an impassioned speech on the floor arguing “there’s no epidemic of police criminality in this country.” ', ' “Policing, historically, has been and belongs in the province of the states, so I’m not sure that there’s a role for Congress per se, except to engage in this discussion and make some points about the fact that the majority of the police do a great job,” the Pennsylvania Republican said. ', ' Scott, however, argues the federal government is “already playing a role” because localities are asking the Justice Department for help: “I believe we can save some money and solve problems before they happen by deploying some resources in that direction,” he said. ', ' Beyond money, there’s concern that federal overreach would alienate cops. ', ' Former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly — who criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for leading what he called an “anti-police campaign” — told POLITICO that Congress walks a fine line when it gets involved. ', ' “Police feel they’re being besieged these days, and I’m not certain that Congress intervention here is needed — and I’m not certain it won’t reinforce the feeling of alienation,” Kelly said. ', ' Scott said lawmakers would tread carefully. ', ' “I’m hesitant to suggest that somehow something insidious is everywhere in law enforcement,” Scott said. “I do think we have to be careful that we don’t somehow create a negative perception that hover [over] all law enforcement officers.” ', ' In fact, there are several proposals circulating on the Hill that would have police advocacy groups and people like Reichert and Kelly up in arms. ', ' One of them by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and firebrand Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) would rein in a federal program that gives local law enforcers surplus military equipment, from grenade launchers to armored vehicles. Ferguson police found themselves in hot water for using such heavy-duty equipment amid protesters, but Reichert argues these can be vital in disaster situations. ', ' For now, most of the work will focus on committees like Grassley’s, which seem to be sticking to areas with more consensus, like mandatory minimums and body cameras. ', ' During a recent speech, Grassley also floated a pitch to require states to give those charged with a misdemeanor counsel in court, and to reform a nationwide database that allows potential employers to find out if applicants were ever arrested — and use it against them even if they were released without charges. ', ' There’s also staff-level talk about whether the standard for a Justice Department investigation into a civil rights case should be lowered, allowing the attorney general to step in more often. In Grassley’s home state of Iowa, for example, a man stopped for alleged drunk boating drowned while cuffed in police custody. But when Grassley asked the attorney general’s office to look into the matter, he was told don’t get your hopes up: It’s nearly impossible to start a civil rights case. ', ' As they move forward, expect Republicans to frame the issue carefully. ', ' “We aren’t going to tell cities how to run their police departments,” Grassley said. ', ' As long as they do something, proponents are fine with that back and forth: “It reached that level [that Congress needs to get involved] a while ago,” Reichert said. Until something is done, he said, “we’re going to see more and more … police officers targeted.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

0,Baltimore mayor requests DOJ investigation into policing practices,"['\n                    By ', '\n                    Updated ', 'Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced Wednesday that she has requested a Department of Justice “pattern or practice” investigation into her city’s police department. ', ' The investigation, which would be conducted by the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division under the leadership of Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, would examine whether Baltimore police have consistently violated the civil rights of local citizens. ', 'Story Continued Below', 'EMILY LIEB', ' Rawlings-Blake told reporters such an investigation is “essential” to “reform serious patterns and practices of excessive force, biased policing and other unconstitutional practices by law enforcement.” ', ' The mayor also added that the city is continuing with outside police investigations into looting that took place after the death of Freddie Gray on April 19. Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died after suffering severe injuries while in police custody. Rawlings-Blake also said that she is working to “fast-track” implementation of body cameras across the Baltimore Police Department. ', ' Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said in a statement that the agency had received the request, but did not say whether such an investigation would be launched. ', ' “The Attorney General is actively considering that option in light of what she heard from law enforcement, city officials, and community, faith and youth leaders in Baltimore yesterday,” Iverson said. ', ' Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday held a series of meetings in Baltimore with Gray’s family, community activists, city officials, and police officers. ', ' Last October, after a series of searing ', 'by Baltimore Sun reporter Mark Puente uncovered multiple incidents of unnecessary police force that led to $5.7 million in settlement payments to victims of misconduct since 2011, the city of Baltimore announced a collaboration with the Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. ', ' COPS has been assessing Baltimore’s problems for the past few months and will release a report on its findings. But the program within COPS overseeing the investigation — a 2011 program called the Collaborative Reform Initiative for Technical Assistance — cannot issue any legally binding directives or sue the city’s police department. Instead, the CRI-TA program is intended for police departments willing to collaborate with the DOJ to implement reform. ', ' Rawlings-Blake told reporters that the DOJ had been “encouraged by the progress we had made” in conjunction with the COPS office but said that in subsequent conversations with federal officials she decided further resources were necessary. ', ' The Civil Rights Division’s report, unlike the review process already underway, would rely upon greater investigatory powers. Like the recently publicized investigation into the Ferguson Police Department in the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black man last August, a “pattern or practice” investigation could result in a legally binding agreement or lawsuit against Baltimore’s police force that forces reforms in department policy.

0,Policing scandals threaten to overwhelm Justice Dept.,"['\n                        Attorney General Loretta Lynch acknowledges ‘we cannot litigate our way out of this problem’', '\n                    By ', '\n                    Updated ', 'The woes of the nation’s 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies have been placed on the shoulders of around 50 lawyers. ', ' These Justice Department lawyers, housed within the agency’s Civil Rights Division, for the past 20 years have represented an aggressive option for the federal government to step in and force rogue law enforcement bodies to clean up their acts. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' But a series of headline-grabbing incidents in which unarmed black men have died after encounters with police has thrust this unit of lawyers into the forefront. And in a move that could set a precedent for police scandal responses, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake this week proactively asked for and was granted such a probe as part of the solution to her city’s policing crisis sparked by the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray. ', ' It’s a big ask for a small unit. ', ' and ', ' Even before the series of deaths at the hands of police — which President Barack Obama said “come up, it seems, like once a week now” — this Special Litigation Section was clamoring for more resources. ', ' Attorney General Loretta Lynch acknowledged the department’s limitations at a press conference Friday in which she announced a new pattern or practice probe into the Baltimore Police Department. ', ' “We always ask for increased resources” from congress, Lynch told reporters. But she added that “we cannot litigate our way out of this problem” by investigating every police department with alleged patterns of misconduct. ', ' In its 2014 budget request, made before the protests in Ferguson, Mo., the Justice Department said it was already flooded with requests for the lawyers to conduct “pattern or practice” investigations into police units suspected of widespread abuse. “On at least a weekly basis, the Division is contacted by community groups, public officials or, in some cases, police leaders asking SPL to open a pattern or practice investigation. Preliminary reviews of these matters have identified very serious concerns that would benefit from the Division’s intervention,” the agency said. ', ' Now, with intense media and political focus on policing issues, the division is ill-equipped to serve as the go-to response for scandal-hit law enforcement departments across the country. ', ' “The president really needs to address the resource issue,” said William Yeomans, a former assistant attorney general who now teaches at American University Law School, who praised the mayor’s decision. ', ' and ', ' He pointed out that the investigation into the 53-officer Ferguson Police Department, released in March, took significant attention from dozens of Justice Department officials. Baltimore, for comparison, has approximately 3,000 officers. ', ' The section, which began its police oversight in 1994, is tasked with more than just pattern-or-practice investigations of police forces. It also probes civil rights abuses in the nation’s thousands of jails and prisons, public reproductive health-care clinics, and in other public institutions. The DOJ has said attorneys in the section only spend a third of their time on police misconduct. ', ' Since taking office, the Obama administration has opened 21 investigations into police departments of various sizes — from Los Angeles and New Orleans to Missoula, Montana, and Beacon, New York. ', ' Such probes can result in legally binding agreements or lawsuits that force reforms in department policy. In its first five years, the Obama-era section secured double the number of agreements of the last five years of the Bush administration. ', ' But the investigations are incredibly labor-intensive, demanding numerous visits to the city and the attention of large numbers of employees. The Justice Department’s 2014 budget request said that each investigation requires, on average, 1,900 hours of attorney time in its first year, a number that would likely increase in a large city such as Baltimore. ', ' Also, the section’s lawyers do not have subpoena power, which can make it challenging to get all the documents they need. ', ' The DOJ, perhaps recognizing how significant a commitment an investigation in Baltimore would be, didn’t immediately agree to launch a pattern-and-practice investigation. A separate part of the Civil Rights Division, focused on criminal investigations, has already launched a more narrow probe into the circumstances around Gray’s death, and on Thursday the Maryland delegation of lawmakers sent a letter asking for the pattern-or-practice investigation. ', ' Rawlings-Blake’s move to call for an investigation into patterns of abuse in her city, though not entirely unprecedented, has until now been quite uncommon. One notable other example is Charles Ramsey, who called for the DOJ to investigate the police forces of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., when he led those departments. ', ' But many experts believe that with so many cities plagued by unrest, other mayors and top police officials could follow suit, stretching the section even thinner. ', ' Samuel Walker, a criminologist and the author of “Presidents and Civil Liberties from Wilson to Obama,” said that Obama should seek to expand the office’s size and powers. ', ' “There are many police departments where there are patterns of abuses of citizens’ rights in violation of the constitution,” he said. “It would be very valuable for the Special Litigation Section to be expanded and for it to be granted subpoena power.” ', ' Whether there is political will for such an expansion is unclear. ', ' For the administration to significantly ramp up the section’s operations, it would need a Republican Congress to endow it with a larger budget and further powers. ', ' Such a change doesn’t seem likely any time soon. Prominent Republicans cautioned the Justice Department against launching an investigation immediately, saying that granting such large-scale probes to mayors possibly seeking political cover would begin a dangerous precedent. ', ' Even Obama has acknowledged that the federal government has a limited role. ', ' “The challenge for us as the federal government is that we don’t run these police forces,” he said at an April 28 press conference following the Baltimore riots. “I can’t federalize every police force in the country and force them to retrain.” ', ' Bradley Schlozman, who ran the Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush, called Mayor Rawlings-Blake’s move a “surrender” to the federal government. Though he declined to say whether or not an investigation in Baltimore was warranted without viewing the facts on the ground, he warned that “you can’t necessarily extrapolate a pattern or practice of misconduct from isolated incidents,” even if they result in widespread protests. ', ' “If you simply indulge a request without ensuring that the proper legal standards have been satisfied, then the department has been politicized,” said Schlozman. He advised that police forces turn first to non-profits and other consultants and view the Department of Justice as a last resort. ', ' Robert Driscoll, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the second Bush administration, also cautioned against mixing politics and policing. ', ' “They should make clear if they’re doing it that they’re doing it based on the facts and not because the mayor requested it,” he said, adding that “local police forces resent consent decrees” since unions and police leadership typically want to organize reforms themselves without federal mandate. ', ' Driscoll said that the special litigation section currently has the capacity to conduct targeted investigations of “several large places at once.” He said 30 to 40 attorneys should be sufficient, so long as the investigations focus on specific practices, like use of K-9s or so-called rough-rides, that are allegedly being abused and don’t pour through every aspect of a police force. ', ' The Justice Department has few other tools besides the Special Litigation Section’s investigations to pursue systemic reforms in police departments. ', ' In 2011, the Obama administration added a new program in the Community Oriented Policing Services office for law enforcement agencies actively seeking reform. But the program has no legally-binding authority and relies on the consent of local leaders who may be reluctant to agree to major overhauls that could include their firing. ', ' To date it has only launched efforts in six cities, one of which was Baltimore last year. ', ' And Yeomans said reviews by the COPS office are no substitute for the patterns or practice investigations, which carry real legal consequences. ', ' “This is the best stick that the Department of Justice has,” Yeomans said. ”Without an effective stick, all of the carrots — federal government collaborative programs [for police reform] — will be less effective.” ', ' ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

', ' Some civil rights leaders and members of Congress are calling on Lynch to soon visit Baltimore to make her presence known in the city that’s been hit with violent demonstrations since Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died after apparently suffering injuries while in police custody earlier this month. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' “I think at some point, it’s important for her to go” to Baltimore, Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said in an interview. “This crisis is not just a local crisis. This is a crisis of national dimensions.” ', ' Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, agreed, with a caveat. “She needs to deploy senior staff to Baltimore, which she has done, and at the appropriate time, I think she does need to go to Baltimore,” he said. “But not this week.” ', ' Justice Department officials say there are no plans at this time for Lynch to go to Baltimore herself. Instead, she has sent some of her top deputies: Vanita Gupta, the head of the department’s civil rights division, and Ron Davis, the director of community oriented policing services at DOJ; and Grande Lum, the head of the department’s Community Relations Services office. ', ' The violence in Baltimore quickly threw Lynch into the first crisis of her term as the nation’s chief law enforcement official as she seeks to restore order in Baltimore and probe the circumstances surrounding Gray’s death earlier this month. The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the matter. ', ' Even as she was being sworn in as attorney general on Monday, it was clear the issue of police-community relations would become one of her key markers during her tenure as the attorney general. Lynch, the first female African-American attorney general, appeared to make a nod to that, saying at her swearing-in ceremony: “We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and in those of us who enforce them.” ', ' Over the past year, there have been a series of fatal clashes between police officers and unarmed black men that have brought to the surface deep mistrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. ', ' But she is no stranger to the issue of police confrontations and accusations of brutality. One of the key cases that the veteran lawyer helped prosecute was that of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1999, where Lynch was on a legal team that secured a guilty plea from a New York police officer for sodomizing Louima with a broomstick. ', ' More recently as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch’s office was heading up the investigation into the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died after being placed in a chokehold by New York police. The Justice Department is still working on that probe, and New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton ', ' earlier this week that Lynch asked him to hold off on the NYPD’s own investigation into the Garner case until the Justice probe is finished. ', ' “She understands community concerns,” said Janice Fedarcyk, a former assistant director for the FBI in New York, where she worked with Lynch. The now-attorney general served as the top federal prosecutor there for two separate terms. Fedarcyk added: “She understands how to reach into those diverse communities and start a dialogue, as much as she understands how tough a law enforcement job is.” ', ' Lynch quickly got to work Monday, briefing President Barack Obama on the situation in Baltimore less than six hours after she was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden at Justice Department headquarters. She was confirmed by the Senate last week on a 56-43 vote, more than five months after she was nominated by Obama in November. ', ' On Tuesday, she directed the Justice Department’s outreach to key leaders and groups in Baltimore, as well as telling Gupta and Davis to contact families for both Gray and the Baltimore police officers injured in the demonstrations on Monday. ', ' The Justice officials sent to Baltimore met with Gray’s family to express their condolences, according to a readout from the department Tuesday night. And during their meeting with a Baltimore police officer who is still hospitalized after Monday’s violent protests, the Justice officials reiterated that safety of officers are a priority, according to the readout. ', ' Though Lynch said contact with Gray’s family was essential, she also added, according to a Justice Department official: “When officers get injured in senseless violence, they become victims as well.” ', ' Lynch held a conference call Tuesday with key members of the Maryland delegation on the current DOJ investigations into the Baltimore police and other assistance that the department could give. She also spoke with Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, according to a Justice Department official. ', ' She “assured us that the DOJ investigations of the Baltimore City Police Department are ongoing and have her highest priority and attention,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said Tuesday night. “I feel confident that the DOJ will conduct thorough investigations and that the findings will help provide answers to the many questions surrounding the death of Freddie Gray and the policies and practices of the Baltimore City Police Department.” ', ' Those who have worked with Lynch closely in years past describe a lawyer who keeps a steady hand, even in the throes of crisis. ', ' “When things get hot, she gets cool and focused,” said David Barlow, a former U.S. attorney from Utah who served with Lynch on a committee of U.S. attorneys that provide advice to the attorney general. He, like Fedarcyk, testified on Lynch’s behalf at her confirmation hearings before the Senate in January. “She is dispassionate, cool, and steady, rather than visceral.” ', ' And even some of her critics had no qualms with how Lynch has handled the crisis in Baltimore so far. ', ' “It’s more, I think, of a local governance and state government issue in terms of the National Guard, in terms of the police,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who voted against Lynch last week. “But looks to me like she’s appropriately sent folks from the civil rights division and others down there to monitor the situation. I think that’s about all she can do at this point.” ', ' Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the crisis engulfing Baltimore and other cities nationwide goes much broader than what Lynch and the Justice Department are able to do. ', ' “There is a role for the attorney general, no question about it,” Fudge said. “I’m hopeful that she will continue the work that Holder started by holding accountable these departments and these individuals, but I think it’s much bigger than her.

0,Report raises questions about Hillary's email defense,"[""\n                        Clinton's claim that email with other State Department accounts was archived may not hold up."", '\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN', '\n                    Updated ', 'A report released Wednesday by the State Department’s internal watchdog raises questions about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s claim that a large proportion of her emails were formally archived because they involved State employees using official email. ', ' The ', ' highlights that State staffers using an email system known as SMART did not have their emails automatically saved for federal record keeping purposes. Staffers using that system had to formally designate individual emails for archiving and rarely did so, the watchdog found. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' In 2011, “Department employees created 61,156 record emails out of more than a billion emails sent,” the report says. In 2013, even fewer emails — 41,749 — were designated for preservation. ', ' At a news conference Tuesday, the likely presidential candidate argued that her decision to use a personal email account “for convenience” did not interfere with the department’s ability to retrieve those messages in response to Freedom of Information Act requests or for the historical record. ', ' “The vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department,” Clinton said Tuesday. ', ' Transparency advocates said the report undermines the former secretary’s assertion. ', ' “Her justification around FOIA requests and around preservation became that most of the documents were cc’d or sent to .gov or state.gov addresses used by employees and therefore were preserved and accessible to requests, ” said John Wonderlich of the Sunlight Foundation. “This [report] suggests that is not reliable at all.” ', ' In some State Department diplomatic posts and offices, trivial numbers of emails were marked as “records” to be preserved in accordance with department policies. State’s Bureau of Energy Resources designated two emails for archiving in 2013. The Population, Refugees and Migration Bureau sent seven such messages, according to the report. ', ' It’s not clear from the report whether officials with whom Clinton traded emails were covered by the SMART system, which required message-by-message selection for archiving, or by other email systems which may have taken a more automated approach. The IG review says in a footnote that the SMART system was not used by State’s “high-level principals, the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, and their immediate staffs, which maintain separate systems.” ', ' Clinton provided 55,000 pages of emails from her private account to the State Department in December at the agency’s request. The full set of emails was not previously accessible to State when conducting records searches or for Freedom of Information Act requests, though some were discovered in email accounts belonging to other State employees. ', ' Spokespeople for the State Department and for Clinton did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. ', ' It’s possible that some State officials are still archiving emails the old-fashioned way, by printing them out and putting them in paper files. The IG report did not attempt to quantify such efforts. ', ' However, the IG report said a large number of employees seemed to be neglecting their archival duties because they did not understand them. ', ' “Most mission and bureau employees who did not use record emails as intended told OIG they were usually unaware of what types of information should be saved as record emails,” the report said. “The Department does not give employees adequate training to distinguish between information that should be preserved as records and information that may be discarded.” ', 'BILL SCHER', ' The report also said some State staffers acknowledged not marking some emails as “records” because that would make them more widely available. “Many interviewees expressed a fear that if participants in … a debate knew that their opinions would be permanently recorded or accessible in searches, they would not express their opinions in an uninhibited manner,” the report said. It was unclear whether employees feared disclosure within the department or outside of it. ', ' One former State Department employee agreed there was widespread confusion about what email to save and what to discard. ', ' ”I think it’s an all-of-government problem with all of this stuff. People aren’t given proper instructions,” said the former official, who asked not to be named. “They don’t tell you how to manage these systems going in.” ', ' Wonderlich noted that if every government employee assumed that every other email recipient was responsible for saving it electronically or on paper, then none of those records would be preserved. ', ' “It’s absurd,” he said. “We don’t allow everyone to erase every message sent to their inbox simply because someone may be able to reconstruct them from emails in some other office or agency.” ', ' In 2013, the National Archives proposed a new email archiving strategy known as Capstone, under which agencies designate official accounts of high-ranking officials or decision-makers to be permanently archived in their entirety or by default. The Capstone approach remains voluntary. ', ' The IG report was produced between January and March of last year. ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Collins opposed Trump on both as she runs for re-election as a party-bucking centrist in Democratic-leaning Maine.', ' But comments Monday from Collins and other Republicans who have challenged Trump recently underscore just how unlikely it is for now that 20 GOP senators would join Democrats and vote to remove the president — the two-thirds threshold needed to convict.', "" Forget impeachment, there was barely any enthusiasm for further exploring the Mueller report's findings.

0,Policing task force calls for 'de-escalation' training,"['\n                The report also says police should deal with mass demonstrations with tactics that “minimize the appearance of a military operation.”', '\n                    By DAVID NATHER', '\n                    Updated ', 'A task force appointed by President Barack Obama is calling for a series of changes to policing around the country in the aftermath of the shooting death of an unarmed African-American teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, last year, including increasing civilian oversight, promoting diversity and improving training on how to de-escalate confrontations. \n ', ' ', ' But the 120-page ', ' essentially punts on one of the most widely discussed ideas since the Ferguson shooting: requiring police officers to wear body cameras to provide more information about their interactions with the public. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The idea gained traction after witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and a grand jury declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in Brown’s death. Obama has ', ' to make $75 million available to help police departments make the cameras widely available. \n ', ' ', ' The report, however, backs away from encouraging stronger steps to promote the use of the cameras, despite pressure from civil rights and police reform groups. Even Obama acknowledged Monday that the cameras raise serious questions about privacy, and that they’re not going to solve all of the problems between police officers and the communities they serve. \n ', ' ', ' “There’s been a lot of talk about body cameras as a silver bullet or a solution,” Obama said after a meeting with the task force members at the White House. “I think the task force concluded that there is a role for technology to play in building additional trust and accountability, but it’s not a panacea, and that it has to be embedded in a broader change in culture and a legal framework that ensures that people’s privacy is respected.” \n ', ' ', ' The task force notes that research suggests police officers who use the cameras use force less often and have fewer complants filed against them. But it also acknowledges that there are privacy concerns about the widespread use of the cameras and that they could undermine the public’s trust by raising concerns about how those videos will be used. \n ', ' ', ' “When the public does not believe its privacy is being protected by law enforcement, a breakdown in community trust can occur,” the report states. It concludes that police departments “need to consider ways to involve the public in discussions related to the protection of their privacy and civil liberties prior to implementing new technology.” \n ', ' ', ' In a conference call with reporters, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said that because the task force only had three months to prepare its recommendations, it tried to stick to a broader discussion about the use of technology: “Today we’re talking about body cameras, tomorrow it will be something else.” But he acknowledged that the task force wanted to make sure “we’re not using technology in violation of privacy rights.” \n ', ' ', ' Obama said he will ask the Department of Justice to implement as many of the 11-member panel’s recommendations as it can, although many of them depend on action by local officials and police chiefs. \n ', ' ', ' The report includes “a series of very specific, concrete, common-sense efforts for us to build trust,” Obama said. “It will be good for police and it will be good for the communities involved. And as a consequence, it will be good for the country.” \n ', ' ', ' The chief recommendations include a call for civilian police boards or commissions, tailored to local communities’ needs, as well as the use of “external and independent prosecutors” in cases where people are killed or injured in shootings by police officers. The task force also recommends more widespread use of community policing and better reporting to the federal government on data in police shootings, a high priority for civil rights groups. \n ', ' ', ' The report also says police departments should deal with mass demonstrations by using tactics that “minimize the appearance of a military operation” – a clear reference to the widely criticized police tactics that were used to shut down demonstrations last summer after Brown’s death in Ferguson. And it advises police departments to teach police officers how to de-escalate confrontations by ”speak[ing] to individuals with respect.” \n ', ' ', ' The report is supposed to prompt a new round of discussions on how to change police procedures throughout the nation to prevent more tragedies like Ferguson and the fatal choking of an unarmed man in Staten Island, New York. It’s the latest chance for Obama to show he’s serious about following up on the widespread anger over those deaths and others – but whether that happens depends on how much he does with the report. \n ', ' ', ' For the past three months, the 11-member task force, headed by Ramsey and former assistant attorney general Laurie Robinson, has been holding public listening sessions on everything from “building trust and legitimacy” to oversight of police departments. It posted a series of draft recommendations on its website last week so the public could follow along as it held its deliberations. \n ', ' ', ' When Obama appointed the task force in December, he was under tremendous pressure to take visible actions to calm the anger over a grand jury’s decision not to indict the police officer in Brown’s death. A task force isn’t usually the kind of thing that convinces protesters to get out of the streets and go home — but Obama insisted this would be the real deal. \n ', ' ', '\n  ', ' ', ' Civil rights leaders hope Obama’s embrace of the report will set a tone that prompts local political leaders and police chiefs to move on some of the ideas. \n ', ' ', ' “I don’t think it’s window dressing. I don’t think it’s public relations damage control,” said Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League. “The power of the presidency and the power of the Department of Justice means the recommendations are going to have some sway,” he said. \n ', ' ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

', 'Story Continued Below', ' In a White House statement Wednesday, Obama did not weigh in on the substance of the panel’s proposals — the first major administration policy response to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations about widespread U.S. monitoring of communications overseas. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' “Over the next several weeks… the President will work with his national security team to study the Review Group’s report, and to determine which recommendations we should implement. The President will also continue consulting with Congress as reform proposals are considered in each chamber,” the statement said. ', ' Obama also “looks forward to speaking to the American people” next month to outline his plans, the White House added. ', ' It was not immediately clear whether the committee’s proposals would result in the telephone data being queried less often than it is now. Under the panel’s recommendations, authorities would have to go to a judge each time they want to explore the data — something they can do now without case-by-case approval from a court. ', ' Some of the most sweeping reforms proposed by the panel focus not on U.S. citizens, but on foreigners, some of whom have been in an uproar over reports of widespread U.S. monitoring of communications overseas. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The committee would push the U.S. intelligence system to treat foreigners more like Americans, by safeguarding their information in ways now used for U.S. citizen-related data and by limiting the most intrusive surveillance strictly to issues of national security. The panel’s report would effectively end the use of much signals intelligence by the U.S. in connection with non-terrorism criminal investigations, like probes of theft of trade secrets, intellectual property piracy and organized crime. ', ' Obama has already decided against implementing one right now — a suggestion that a civilian be named as next NSA director. Panel members said the president signaled he plans to put another military office in that post when the current director retires in a few months. ', ' The White House statement Wednesday included no explicit mention that the president would likely reject some recommendations — a possibility raised in earlier comments from White House officials. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' During a briefing for reporters in Washington Wednesday, members of the committee seemed concerned that their proposals would be seen as so sweeping that they would undermine national security. ', ' “We’re not saying the struggle against terrorism is over or it has declined to such an extent that we can dismantle the mechanisms we have put in place to defend the country,” said Richard Clarke, a counterterrorism adviser in the Clinton White House. “What we are saying is those mechanisms can be more transparent. They can have more outside oversight and judicial oversight.” ', ' “We are not in any way recommending the disarming of the intelligence community,” said Michael Morell, a former deputy director and former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency. ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Panel members said the five-member group was unanimous about all 46 of its recommendations. ', ' “We reached a consensus with great ease,” said Harvard Law professor and former Office of Management and Budget official Cass Sunstein. “Our report has no dissenting views.” ', ' The highest-profile recommendation from the panel involves the handling of the database the NSA currently maintains with five-years-worth of data on telephone calls made to, from, or within the U.S. The report proposes ending the NSA’s collection of that information, with investigators relying in the future on similar information in the private sector. ', ' “That is, we believe, not going to compromise our national security, but it is a major change from the status quo,” Sunstein said. ', ' But the report is vague about exactly how the private-sector system would work and does not appear to envisage a database or system as large as the one the government has now. It urges that the government make a voluntary pact with technology companies to store the data, but also discusses the possibility of legislation to force storage of call records, perhaps by a private organization that could pool the dat ', ' ', ' The panel recommends that any legislation requiring phone companies to store call data force them to hold “no more than two years” of information. ', ' Administration officials and some in Congress say leaving the data with the companies would not be effective because it would be too hard to query in a timely manner. But panel members said they were confident those difficulties could be overcome. ', ' “There would have to be some mechanism to connect a court-supervised acquisition process with the data records that are at the phone companies,” Clarke said. “We think that’s technically feasible.” ', ' Even if it isn’t, the data could certainly be pooled, Clarke said. If it is, the panel recommends that legislation be enacted to make sure the information isn’t available for ordinary litigation. ', ' “What we suggest is that there be legal protection, safe harbor, so not everybody can go, say, in a divorce proceeding, you can’t try to get the records,” Clarke said. ', ' While the panel proposes a new layer of judicial review for queries of U.S.-based call data, the standard for diving into the data would be essentially the same as the one the NSA says it uses today: a reasonable suspicion that the information could be useful for investigating terrorist activity. ', ' Sunstein acknowledged in a brief interview Wednesday that the legal standard wouldn’t change for queries on particular telephone numbers and would not increase to the “probable cause” needed to obtain the content of communications, but he said the fact that requests would have to go to judge might cause the authorities to re-think some of their requests. ', ' “They might decide not to go forward with some of them,” he said. He also stressed that the searches of the database would likely be narrower. ', ' As recently as Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the panel report would not be made public until next month, after the White House completed an interagency review of the policy proposals and Obama decided which would be adopted. He did not explain the reason for the delay, but suggested that officials wanted Obama’s views, in the form of a planned speech, to be released along with the report ', ' However, the White House reversed course Wednesday and said it would disclose the report within hours because of what Carney said were “inaccurate and incomplete” news reports about its contents.

', ""But Sunday's moment only came after much of the year leading up to it was spent with the mayor seemingly in the path of Mark-Viverito's goal."", ""The report's recommendations, which de Blasio has not publicly embraced the specifics of, would take at least ten years and $11 billion dollars to complete, along with the construction of five smaller state of the art facilities in each borough, all located near the court houses and civic centers that serve each county. The plan would also be contingent on a continued and steady decline in crime, which would help the city continue to decrease its jail population through a mix of criminal justice and court reforms. "", ""Following through on the recommendations would also take enormous political will for a decade's worth of city leaders, a willingness to finance the construction of new facilities in neighborhoods where none exist and overcoming neighborhood reluctance to hold people accused of a crime within the neighborhood where they offended. "", ""Mark-Viverito, who has supported a series of legislation aimed at criminal justice reform, was clearly emotional at the plan's rollout Sunday at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, standing beside former chief judge Jonathan Lippman, who chaired the commission. The pair were joined by law enforcement officials and members of the City Council."", '“We can now say that the dream of closing Rikers Island will become a reality. Based on this landmark report, we are confident in stating that Rikers Island will see its last incarcerated individual leave custody in about ten years,” Mark-Viverito said. ', 'As Lippman outlined his mission to close the jail, sixteen miles away de Blasio spoke at a black church in Brooklyn, touting his decision to endorse the principle of closing Rikers as the beginning of the end to the era of mass incarceration in America, despite having only come to publicly supporting the decision himself on Friday.', '""Mass incarceration can be ended. It can be ended if we keep driving down crime, if we have the right approach we can end it. And I want to tell you something about mass incarceration. It didn\'t begin here in New York City, but it will end here in New York City,” de Blasio told those assembled at Brooklyn\'s Christian Cultural Center. ""I announced on Friday that we are intending over these next years to drive our jail population down and down and down, and that will allow us once and for all to close the jail on Rikers Island, and to take a clean break from the past.""', 'But before Friday, de Blasio had spent more than a year ', ' the idea of closing the Rikers Island jail as a “noble” but unworkable proposal, citing high costs and logistical challenges. ', 'According to numerous sources close to the process, the situation changed significantly over the past few weeks, though mayoral aides have insisted de Blasio’s transition was long in the making. The mayor found himself faced with shifting political dynamics that made those close to him believe that the time was right to embrace the idea of closing Rikers, as de Blasio heads into a re-election year firmly situated for a presumptive second term.', 'Getting to this point took months, and the outcome was uncertain.', 'De Blasio was blindsided a year ago when Mark-Viverito called for an independent commission to look into possible options for closing Rikers during her 2016 State of the City speech, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.', 'Mark-Viverito and de Blasio have worked in tandem on much of the major policy that comes before the Council. But by early 2016, the two had had several disagreements — including the mayor’s failed bid to ban horse carriages from the city and his failed proposal to cap the growth of ride hail app providers. Mark-Viverito’s call to close Rikers further frustrated the mayor, who sources said viewed the proposal as a slight after he had worked alongside the speaker in 2015 to ', "" in the budget, something he'd opposed during his first year in office. "", '“He was not happy,” said one source with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking at the time. “He tried to bring her closer through budgeting, especially with funding the cops. In his mind, he felt like he’d done right by the Council and Melissa and now she was pulling a fast one.”', 'Mark-Viverito’s February 2016 call to close the jail gathered quick backing, and not only from jail reform advocates — Gov.

The problem is it would cost many billions of dollars, and I have to look out for what is feasible. I have to look out for the taxpayer,” de Blasio ', ' days after Mark-Viverito’s speech.', '“In the end you are still going to need facilities — where are you going to put them, how are you going to pay for them? — so, a noble concept but one that would cost many billions of dollars and we do not have a viable pathway to that at this point,” he said then.', ""The mayor wasn't alone in suggesting closing the jail would be unrealistic. Glenn Martin, president of JustLeadershipUSA, a criminal justice reform organization, said Sunday Mark-Viverito’s call was initially viewed by many as a “pipe dream.”"", ""Lippman’s commission got to work early last year all the same. It pulled together a host of people from across the city's social, political and economic spectrum. Commission members who have since spoken to POLITICO New York say they went from being uncertain to being firmly behind the report’s recommendations to close Rikers."", ""While the commission worked, de Blasio faced a steady drumbeat of protests and rallies on the steps of City Hall pushing for Rikers' closure. More recently, Cuomo, a frequent mayoral antagonist, has increased his "", ' of de Blasio over the jail.', 'That growing pressure was not lost on City Hall.', 'Last Friday, during a press conference to announce his support of the plan, de Blasio said he and key members of his team routinely looked at the situation at Rikers in the hopes of seeing a path forward to possibly closing it.', ""But before coming to that point, the mayor’s criminal justice team rolled out reform after reform aimed at improving safety and conditions at the island jail, while focusing on reducing the island's population through initiatives that sought to resolve old cases and limit new ones. For activists committed to closing the island facility, however, these reforms were only cosmetic."", 'The mayor on Friday credited Mark-Viverito with providing him the “breakthrough” of a ten-year time-frame that he said allowed him to make that final leap forward to support the eventual shuttering of Rikers. But a few additional outside factors also gave de Blasio the agency to act.', ""Calls to close the jail have come from the same community of activists and voters the mayor had appealed to with his call to end stop-and-frisk policing during his 2013 campaign, potentially exposing a re-election vulnerability on the mayor's left. At the same time, long-running investigations into the mayor's fundraising had until recently left open the possibility of a Democratic primary challenger who could have run more to the political center, potentially making it more politically challenging for the mayor to make a big play on Rikers to his progressive base."", 'But those investigations concluded last month with no charges against the mayor or anyone on his team, all but closing the door for the most serious Democratic primary challengers. With that threat likely gone and de Blasio facing the possibility of being the last progressive in town to endorse closing Rikers, the political dynamics changed.', '“This seems to be pretty smart politics, with very few downsides post-investigation, and with the strong assumption that he glides into a second term largely unopposed,"" said David Birdsell, dean of Baruch College’s school of public and international affairs.', 'The final decision on Rikers came together quickly. Several sources involved in the discussions said the commission planned to release its report on April 19. It would have included its recommendation to close the facility in a decade after population levels were reduced to at least 5,000, with new facilities would being built in each borough.', ""De Blasio was briefed on the plan's details by Lippman a handful of times starting a week and a half ago, with the purpose of informing him ahead of time of what the report would say. "", ""As the report release date approached, de Blasio announced last Wednesday the city would create a program to offer re-entry services to all inmates leaving the island as part of a broad criminal justice reform vision by installing policies intended to help reduce recidivism. Throughout that announcement, de Blasio stressed that a bigger announcement related to Rikers would come before the executive budget's release, while insisting that his focus was on reform. "", 'According to sources, it was during this relatively brief time period that the mayor’s stance officially shifted. De Blasio informed the commission last Wednesday he would endorse the basics of the proposal, despite taking issue with a number of the more politically problematic points, such as building new facilities in each borough. ', 'Lippman on Sunday declined to provide details about his conversations with the mayor, but said the briefings had been held with the goal of closing Rikers. ', '“I am not going to talk about our private conversations, but I will tell you that they were all in the spirit of getting rid of this place,” Lippman told reporters Sunday. “There hasn’t been any doubt that that was the direction we were going, that it was direction that he wanted to go.""', ""According to people familiar with the planning of the event, de Blasio's quick move drew the ire of Mark-Viverito, who had wanted the commission to release its findings without being eclipsed by the mayor. But her efforts to keep the commission’s work secret until the official release date were futile, as news of the report "", ' late Thursday, and de Blasio called a quickly arranged press conference on Friday. The fast-moving events resulted in the mayor confirming he would support the plan, while still pleading ignorance about the contents of the report.', ""Aides to the mayor insisted de Blasio's plan to announce his support to close Rikers was in the making for weeks, but sources involved in the commission and the planning of the report's release said the mayor's position did not become clear until days before his announcement."", ""Eric Phillips, de Blasio's press secretary, went further on Monday, reiterating that de Blasio had backed the closure of Rikers from the beginning."", '""The Mayor has always been publicly and privately supportive of the goal behind the closure movement. It\'s no secret that City Hall has been working diligently behind the scenes for some time to test whether closing the facility at some point in the future is feasible.

0,Grimm expected to be indicted,"['\n                The Justice Department was looking into Grimm’s relation with Ofer Biton.', '\n                    By ', ' and ', '\n                    Updated ', 'Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Loretta Lynch, according to the New York Republican’s lawyer. \n ', ' ', ' Grimm has been under investigation by federal authorities for alleged campaign finance violations. The federal charges against Grimm, set to be unveiled by next week, are expected to include mail and wire fraud, said a source familiar with the case. \n ', ' ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The New York Times reported that the charges may be connected to a restaurant that Grimm owned after he left the FBI in 2006, although Grimm’s attorneys could not confirm that at press time. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' The timing of the expected Grimm indictment also couldn’t be worse for Republicans. The filing deadline for that race has closed, meaning GOP leadership could be stuck with him on the ballot come Election Day. \n ', ' ', ' Grimm’s attorney, William McGinley of the law firm Patton Boggs, denounced the Justice Department’s looming criminal action against Grimm as prosecutorial overreach. \n ', ' ', ' “After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,” McGinley said in a statement. “We are disappointed by the government’s decision, but hardly surprised. From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth. Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing.” \n ', ' ', ' \n ', ' ', ' McGinley added: “When the dust settles, he will be vindicated. Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent.” ', ' ( ', ') ', ' Robert Nardoza, the spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, would not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on a potential indictment of Grimm. \n ', ' ', ' Lynch, who was appointed to her office by President Barack Obama in May 2010, oversees federal cases in Brooklyn, Queens, eastern Long Island and Grimm’s home district of Staten Island. \n ', ' ', ' The expected indictment of Grimm is a major step for the Justice Department, which has not been as active in pursuing corruption cases involving sitting federal lawmakers since the debacle surrounding the late Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). \n ', ' ', ' Stevens was indicted shortly before the 2008 elections and was later convicted on charges that he failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper gifts, including a home renovation. \n ', ' ', ' ( ', ') ', ' But the conviction was later voided after it was found that federal prosecutors withheld information from Stevens’s defense team. The scandal badly damaged the reputation of DOJ’s Public Integrity unit, which had built an impressive résumé prosecuting corrupt congressmen and senators. \n ', ' ', ' The Justice Department has been scrutinizing Grimm’s relationship with Ofer Biton, an Israeli citizen who pleaded guilty last year to a visa violation. Grimm — with Biton’s help — raised more than $500,000 from Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto’s followers, including allegedly improper donations. \n ', ' ', ' Grimm has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but his ongoing ethical and legal problems have made him a top target for Democrats in 2014. \n ', ' ', ' Grimm was first elected to Congress in 2010. His district is anchored in Staten Island and Brooklyn. He beat Democratic Rep. Michael McMahon that cycle, and handily topped Democrat Mark Murphy in 2012. \n ', ' ', ' The filing deadline for another Republican to challenge Grimm has passed. \n ', ' ', ' The Democrat who is taking on Grimm, former N.Y. City Councilman Domenic Recchia Jr., had more than $1 million in cash in the bank as of March 31, according to his latest campaign disclosure report. \n ', ' ', ' Mike Long, New York’s Conservative Party chairman, said he was suspicious of the timing of the indictment, coming so soon after the closing of the filing period. Long said his party would still support Grimm for reelection unless he is found guilty. \n ', ' ', ' But Long added that he had no doubt that the development would severely damage Grimm in his reelection campaign. \n ', ' ', ' “Does it make a difference? Very much so.” \n ', ' ', ' Grimm’s legal troubles have been costly as well. His campaign was $453,656 in debt at the end of March. He owed $417,477.96 in legal fees to Patton Boggs, and $17,364 to the Terrance Group for polling. His campaign reported nearly $1.2 million in cash at the end of the first quarter of 2014. \n ', ' ', ' Grimm was the subject of widespread attention earlier this year when he threatened to throw a local New York reporter off a balcony in the Capitol complex. He later apologized. \n ', ' ', ' Melanie Sloan of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said Grimm should resign immediately if and when he’s indicted. \n ', ' ', ' “Year after year, Rep. Grimm has committed some other reprehensible misdeed,” Sloan said in a statement. “It is about time the criminal justice system caught up with him. How ironic that one of the few corrupt lawmakers the Department of Justice can bring itself to prosecute is also a former FBI agent. Rep.

They also help provide the early outlines of who Trump will rely on as he takes over governing the country. With the earlier appointments of Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Steve Bannon as chief strategist, Trump so far has selected only white men, some of whom have been dogged by their past incendiary rhetoric.

Sessions could clear the judiciary panel with only Republican votes before his nomination faces a Senate floor vote, with only a majority required for confirmation.', 'Like Shelby, Cruz was also pleased that his Senate colleague will join Trump\'s cabinet, calling the pick ""great news for all of us who revere the Constitution and the rule of law.""

While Senator Sessions and I differ on a great many issues, I am committed to a full and fair process.”', 'Since the Justice Department defends virtually all federal government agencies in court, as attorney general Sessions would have a hand in preserving the full range of policies the Trump administration seeks to implement on issues ranging from immigration to the environment to dismantling Obamacare.', 'In recent years, Sessions has emerged as one of the Senate’s most strident and vocal critics of the Obama administration’s immigration policies. He has repeatedly accused the administration of releasing dangerous illegal immigrants in the U.S. and diluting the job prospects of American workers by flooding the labor markets with immigrants.', 'Sessions’ nomination is another significant blow to criminal justice reform efforts, whose future already seemed in doubt due to Trump’s law-and-order campaign themes.', 'Plans to overhaul tough-on-crime policies from the 1980s and 1990s have enjoyed support from both political parties recently on Capitol Hill, but Sessions has been a vocal opponent of calls to reduce sentences for drug offenders. When the Judiciary Committee approved broad criminal justice reform legislation last year, Sessions was one of five GOP senators to vote against it.', 'Despite the opposition he is likely to face from Democrats, Senate Republicans seem ready to defer to Trump\'s cabinet picks.

', ' Reining in the multibillion-dollar industry has been the administration’s goal for most of President Barack Obama’s term in office, fueled by complaints that for-profit colleges lure students with misleading promises, then saddle them with debts they can’t pay back despite their newly granted degrees. Its latest tool is the Education Department’s long-debated “gainful employment” rule, which requires colleges to track their graduates’ performance in the workforce and eventually will cut off funding for career training programs that fall short. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' The rule — upheld by a court ruling last week and set to take effect Wednesday — will trigger the closure of 1,400 programs that together enroll 840,000 students, the department ', '. Ninety-nine percent of those students attend for-profits. ', ' The regulation is part of a broader series of crackdowns on the industry by agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with investigations, lawsuits and fines from states and blistering criticism from Democrats like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Dick Durbin. Some major college operators have begun closing or selling campuses under the onslaught. ', ' Supporters call the regulatory moves long overdue. But the industry denounces them as a witch hunt. ', ' “We’ve come to expect these unjust assaults,” said Gene Feichtner, president and chief operating officer of the huge for-profit chain ITT Technical Institute, which has been sued by CFPB, faces fraud charges from SEC and is under investigation by 16 state attorneys general. “Let there be no presumption here that we believe we’ll be treated fairly.” ', 'ARNE DUNCAN', ' For-profits blame the regulations and investigations for accelerating their financial decline — a turnaround from the way the industry blossomed under what the White House ', ' as looser restrictions implemented by the George W. Bush administration. (Sally Stroup, general counsel for the industry’s national trade group, worked for Bush’s education secretary after working for for-profit operator Apollo Education Group.) ', ' Assaults are coming from all fronts. Last Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that the college operator Education Affiliates would pay $13 million to settle allegations it had falsified federal financial aid claims and misled Education Department officials by helping applicants obtain fake diplomas and then collecting federal financial aid dollars for those students. ', ' For-profit colleges enroll just 11 percent of students nationally, yet account for 44 percent of federal student loan defaults, department officials often say. ', ' Now-defunct Corinthian was once a giant in the for-profit college industry, before financial sanctions imposed by the Education Department essentially ', '. Three other major operators — DeVry Education Group, Career Education Corp. and Education Management Corp. — announced in the past month that they would either sell or shut down campuses, with some citing the upcoming gainful employment rule. ', ' Critics and regulators say the colleges are so vulnerable only because of their own practices. The industry is plagued with student loan borrowing and default rates higher than other types of institutions, and graduates report worse career outcomes. ', ' The gainful employment regulation applies to community colleges and public universities as well, but for-profit programs fare worst under the rule’s key evaluation metric, a debt-to-earnings ratio. The industry, which collected about $22 billion in taxpayer loans and Pell Grants in 2013, says it’s being unfairly targeted, punished by the government for enrolling high-risk students — first-generation, adult, low-income and the like — who are less likely to repay loans but need access to the flexible models that for-profits provide. ', ' Reflecting on the recent closures, Education Undersecretary Ted Mitchell said: “I do think that’s a positive sign, and I think it’s a sign that the industry is taking outcomes seriously, just as we’re saying we’re going to take outcomes seriously.” ', ' This is the Education Department’s second try at a rule, after the first attempt was upended in court. ', ' For-profit colleges have taken some steps to change their practices, in part to push back against the legal and regulatory onslaught. Kaplan restructured or closed several programs. Colleges started offering trial enrollment periods. And some, like the largest operator, University of Phoenix, agreed to use the federal “Shopping Sheet” financial aid comparison tool. ', ' “They’re responding — in what I think is an appropriate way — to limit programs that are underperforming,” Mitchell said. “Which is what we hope all institutions across the for-profit and the nonprofit sector would be doing.” ', ' Enrollment at for-profit colleges grew from 4.6 percent of all undergraduates in 2000 to 10.3 percent of all undergraduates in 2012, according to a recent Woodstock Institute report. That growth coincided with the Bush administration Education Department’s creation of a dozen “safe harbors” letting colleges base recruiters’ salaries on their success in securing enrollments, circumventing measures passed by Congress in the early 1990s. ', ' “Each one of those safe harbors chipped away at the law’s ability to be enforced,” David Hawkins, director of public policy and research at the National Association of College Admission Counseling, once told the Senate. ', ' The Obama administration repealed those loopholes. ', ' Department data show that the number of students enrolled at for-profits ', ' at about 2.4 million in 2010, and the number of four-year for-profit colleges ', ' at 671 institutions in 2011. (Continued growth in the two-year for-profit sector meant the industry was still on the upswing in 2012-13, the most recent year for which the department has data.) ', ' And in some cases, taxpayers are paying the price. The department in June ', ' its debt relief plan for Corinthian students who relied on false job-placement rates when enrolling. The initial cost for the loan discharges is upward of $500 million — and that’s only a portion of what could ultimately reach billions of dollars in discharges for students at any law-breaking institution. ', ' Corinthian is out of cash. But when students duped by other colleges seek discharges under “defense against repayment” regulations, as they surely will, the department will recoup that money from the institution whenever possible, Mitchell said. ', ' “Our goal is not to close institutions and programs,” a White House official said. “Our goal is to improve them. And we see that happening. At the end of the day, if a program is unable to meet the gainful employment standard after being given every opportunity to do so … that’s not acceptable.” ', ' Industry enrollments are now on the downswing, clocking a 20 percent drop since 2010. Many major providers’ stock prices have fallen dramatically in the same period: ITT, Corinthian and EDMC saw declines of 95 percent, while Strayer Education and Apollo dropped 65 percent. Apollo’s University of Phoenix has closed 115 campuses and halved its enrollment since initiating a restructuring in 2011 — “to re-engineer our business processes and educational delivery systems to students.” ', ' Apollo ', ' Tuesday that it will lay off 600 employees, close more campuses and — in a major shift — add new admissions criteria, which could further cut declining enrollments while simultaneously increasing student retention and graduation rates. ', ' Hundreds of campuses run by for-profit providers nationwide have closed in recent years, department ', ' show. ', ' A for-profit model that aims to maximize enrollment — and thus, profit — without regard to innovation or program quality may not be long for this world, said Derrick Anderson, an assistant public policy professor at Arizona State University. ', ' “There are many different for-profit models, and the for-profit paradigm is not inherently bad when applied to higher education,” Anderson said. For instance, a college like Flatiron School in New York City — whose simple financial model is built around student job placement — can and will continue to do just fine. ', ' “However,” Anderson said, “it seems increasingly the case that some of those models cannot work.” ', ' All the action hasn’t quieted for-profit critics in and outside of Congress, who think the Education Department isn’t doing enough to punish colleges or help students they believe have been left with huge debt and degrees deemed worthless in some cases. ', ' “The continued upheaval in the wake of Corinthian’s collapse is a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that profits off students while sticking them with a worthless degree and insurmountable debt,” Durbin said. The Illinois Democrat called Corinthian’s dismantling “the canary in the coal mine for the for-profit college industry.” ', ' Even while scrutinizing the department’s handling of Corinthian — most recently, regarding its ', ' for closed-school student loan discharges — critics agree the country is undoubtedly better off with Corinthian out of the picture. ', ' When a college closing means fewer students wind up in hopeless situations, it’s “absolutely a positive thing,” said Rory O’Sullivan, deputy director of Young Invincibles. ', ' California Attorney General Kamala Harris sued Corinthian Colleges, alleging it misrepresented job placement rates and school programs to lure low-income state residents.(AP Photo) ', '\n  ', ' ', ' O’Sullivan sat on the department’s negotiated rulemaking ', ', which set out to develop the gainful employment regulation in 2013-14. The group failed to reach consensus on regulatory language, so the department wrote the rule itself, leaving neither colleges nor advocates like O’Sullivan entirely satisfied. ', ' Yet between the regulations, the publicity and the action by agencies from various federal agencies, “there’s certainly a lot of progress that the administration could take some credit for,” O’Sullivan said. ', ' “We’ve learned that this is hard work, that it’s detailed work, and that the stakes are high,” Mitchell said. “We want to get it right, but we can always learn more. And I think we’ve learned a lot through the Corinthian situation.” ', ' There may well be more disruption to come. ', ' This spring has certainly been tough on the industry: DeVry had already said it would close more than a dozen campuses. Corinthian’s announcement two months ago that its last 28 campuses would never again open their doors prompted several lawmakers to demand closed-school discharges for those students. And then Career Education Corp. and EDMC dropped their respective bombs: The former would phase out 14 campuses and sell another three, and the latter would eventually wind down 15 of its 52 Art Institute locations. ', ' Further, EDMC ', ' last week that it will cut 300 jobs. Enrollment at the company’s four for-profit brands has dropped nearly 30 percent since 2010, reports indicate. ', ' Late last year, Career Education also said it would sell its 16-campus Le Cordon Bleu culinary school chain. ', ' The gainful employment rule is only part of the picture. Factors beyond the control of the administration — and the colleges themselves — are at play, too.

Finally, on Thursday, the release of Mueller’s final report showcased the large amounts of daylight between the veteran law enforcement officials on fundamental questions at the heart of Donald Trump’s presidency.', ""“We don't go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public,” Barr said with evident frustration, referring to Mueller’s "", ' which failed to make a conclusive finding on whether Trump obstructed justice. “Because the special counsel did not make that decision, we felt the department had to. That was a decision by me and the deputy attorney general.”', 'Now, the tension between Barr and Mueller is only going to increase when the two men are summoned to testify separately on Capitol Hill about the turbo-charged Russia investigation that consumed Trump’s first two years in office. Democrats are intent on uncovering any evidence that Barr shaded the public disclosure of Mueller’s findings to favor the president who appointed him.', 'Differences in how the attorney general and special counsel came at the Russia probe and interpret its findings are apparent on many levels.', 'Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics', 'By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.', 'First there’s the rhetoric. Barr in Thursday’s news conference four times adopted the same “no collusion” mantra that Trump has used obsessively since the Mueller investigation started. It’s language that stands in sharp contrast to Mueller, whose report ticks through a stream of interactions between Trump, his family, aides and allies and Russians interested in cultivating a rookie Republican politician mounting a long-shot bid for the White House. ', 'The only references the special counsel makes to “collusion” come in an attempt to explain how the term is hardly the accurate legal one but instead should be thought of in the context of a conspiracy.', 'Barr, in his much-criticized news conference, also defended Trump and reiterated his “sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency.” Mueller, by contrast, offered in his report a methodical run-down of all the evidence that his prosecution team unearthed during a nearly two-year investigation, calling out Trump aides for giving misleading testimony and deleting records to block the investigation.', 'More than anything, though, the contrast between Barr and Mueller centers primarily around whether Trump committed obstruction of justice — and whether the attorney general ', ' the special counsel’s views on the subject in his ', ' to Congress last month and then again Thursday during the press event.', 'At the news conference, Barr declared that Trump’s White House “fully cooperated” with Mueller’s probe.', 'Mueller’s report, however, made it clear that Trump himself did not submit to a sit-down interview and, in negotiated written questions, declined to answer questions about obstruction of justice.', 'While there have been hints for weeks that Barr and Mueller did not see eye-to-eye on the Trump-Russia case, Barr publicly confirmed the disconnect with Mueller at the news conference when Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “disagreed” with some of the special counsel’s legal theories underlying the obstruction investigation.', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', ' and ', 'Some of the 10 episodes Mueller specifically examined didn’t amount to crimes “as a matter of law,” Barr said.', 'But Mueller’s report made no findings on Trump’s legal culpability, explaining that the special counsel was adhering to longstanding Justice Department ', ' ', ' that a sitting president could not be indicted. Mueller’s lengthy analysis went on to say that claiming the president obstructed justice without the ability to charge him would taint his presidency and damage his ability to govern — leaving him with no legal recourse to clear his name or protections normally afforded to criminal defendants.', 'But that series of caveats is notably surrounded by multiple examples of potential obstruction by Trump, including urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his decision to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation; pressing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller; and communicating through back channels his appreciation for loyalty to key investigative targets like Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. ', '“If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” the Mueller report said. “Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. …Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”', 'Barr, however, insisted at his news conference that Mueller had “made it very clear several times” that the Justice Department’s guidance on charging a president wasn’t what stopped Mueller from concluding that Trump had committed a crime. ', '“He was not saying that but for the [Justice Department] opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime,” Barr explained.', 'Barr also rejected the idea that Mueller in his report was all along angling to send his findings to Congress for it to consider impeachment proceedings.', ""“I hope that was not his view, since we don't convene grand juries and conduct criminal investigations for that purpose. "", "" I didn't talk to him directly about the fact that we were making the decision, but I am told that his reaction to that was that it was my prerogative as attorney general to make that decision,” the attorney general said."", '\n                    ', '\n                    By POLITICO STAFF', 'Some former officials who know both Barr and Mueller expressed disappointment Thursday in Barr’s decision to present what they viewed as a skewed version of Mueller’s findings.', ""“The attorney general only talked about stuff favorable to the president and that struck me as odd and it did strike me as a tactic,” a former U.S. attorney who knows both men, Chuck Rosenberg, said on MSNBC Thursday. “We need to see what Mueller said, not the characterization of what Mueller said by the attorney general. That was a tactic. He did employ it. It's disappointing to me, but not terribly surprising.”"", 'Barr arguably cast the first stone in the conflict between the two men nearly a year ago by writing an unsolicited ', ' attacking the notion that Trump could be guilty of obstruction of justice for any efforts to end the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.', 'The June 2018 missive sent to Rosenstein argued that the obstruction case against Trump was so weak — and the legal theory for accusing the president of obstruction so flawed — that Mueller’s team should not even be permitted to demand an interview with Trump.', '“Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived,” Barr declared in his broadside, which he also circulated to more than a dozen other prominent lawyers across Washington. Barr argued that only acts such as witness tampering and destruction of evidence could amount to obstruction by the president, but actions stemming from his constitutional authority to end an investigation or replace its overseer could not.', 'Barr, who previously served as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, went even further in the memo, contending that if there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, the president could not be guilty of obstruction of justice and therefore Mueller should not be able to press that issue further.', '“The president’s motive in removing [FBI Director James] Comey and commenting on [the inquiry into former National Security Adviser Michael] Flynn could not have been ‘corrupt’ unless the President and his campaign were actually guilty of illegal collusion,” the once and future attorney general wrote. “Either the President and his campaign engaged in illegal collusion or they did not … If they did not, then the cover up theory is untenable.”', 'Mueller’s report appears to reject that conclusion, stating that statutes do not require the existence of an underlying crime to prosecute someone for obstruction of justice.', '“I don’t think the Mueller report reflects either the view that public officials cannot obstruct justice through official acts or that obstruction of an investigation into something that isn’t unlawful isn’t obstruction,” said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, summarizing points Barr made in his 2018 memo. “The contrary, I read the Mueller report as suggesting that both of the opposite things are true … but I do think the report was written with this fight about obstruction in mind, partly because of Barr and partly because that argument about obstruction has been out there a while.”', 'Barr did acknowledge in his 2018 memo that he did not have all relevant facts about the investigation, which could give him a chance to say his views have evolved or are now more informed. But there was no sign Thursday he plans such a shift. In addition, the legal conclusions he articulated before becoming attorney general were so sweeping that they seemed to dismiss thousands of hours of work Mueller’s team had invested in their inquiry.', 'During Barr’s confirmation hearing in January, he didn’t shy away from talking about his personal relationship with Mueller — a sore spot with Trump considering the president had been firing direct Twitter broadsides at the special counsel for months.', 'In his testimony, Barr said he and his wife were close to Mueller and his wife. Barr added that when he met with Trump briefly in 2017 about possibly becoming a personal lawyer for the president, Trump asked about his relationship with Mueller, and Barr replied that he and his wife “would be good friends” with the Muellers long after the probe concluded.', 'Despite that exchange, Barr’s talk at the confirmation hearing about his friendship with Mueller startled Trump as he watched the session on TV, ', '.', 'At the Senate hearing, Barr also seemed to downplay his June 2018 memo, saying it didn’t challenge Mueller’s “core investigation.” The then-nominee also went on to say he wouldn’t rule out subpoenaing Trump before a grand jury if Mueller asked to do so.', '“I don’t know what the facts are,” Barr said then. “If there was a factual basis for doing it and I couldn’t say that it violated established policies, then I wouldn’t interfere, but I don’t know what the facts are.”', 'But there have been clear indications in recent weeks of more distance between Barr and Mueller than what one might expect given their professional and personal history.', 'Mueller was notably absent from Barr’s announcement Thursday. Instead, the attorney general was flanked by Rosenstein and an aide who helped oversee Mueller’s probe, Ed O’Callaghan. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined comment when asked whether the special counsel had even been invited to the event.', 'At the news conference, Barr said he and Mueller had not spoken about the attorney general’s decision to issue a public conclusion that Trump wasn’t guilty of a crime, even though Mueller explicitly refrained from making such a declaration.', ""“I didn't talk to him directly about the fact that we were making the decision, but I am told that his reaction to that was that it was my prerogative as attorney general to make that decision,” Barr said."", 'A Justice Department official who spoke on background said there had been little contact between the two men in the past two months. The only direct interaction Barr mentioned was on March 5, when Mueller gave the new attorney general an update on the special counsel investigation. Mueller informed Barr and Rosenstein that he planned to close the investigation without resolving whether Trump obstructed justice, the official said.', '“Barr and Rod were both surprised,” the official said. “It was unexpected.”', 'On Capitol Hill, the hearings on the Mueller report seem unlikely to produce a face-to-face confrontation between the attorney general and the special counsel. Still, Democrats are likely to zero in on whether Barr mischaracterized Mueller’s finding when the attorney general comes to Capitol Hill for back-to-back Senate and House hearings set for May 1 and May 2.', 'House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) leapt on the differences between Mueller and Barr, noting that the special counsel’s report said a “thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would have risen to personal and political concerns.”', 'But Barr “excluded this critical finding from his version of events,” said the New York Democrat, who on Thursday sent a letter to Mueller inviting him to testify by May 23.', 'For his part, Barr said Thursday he had no objection to Mueller appearing before lawmakers. Mueller’s spokesman declined comment when asked whether the special counsel — who assiduously shunned the spotlight during his nearly two-year tenure — plans to accept Nadler’s invitation to testify.', 'One way for the Trump team to try to defuse or smooth over any tension between the two men may be to suggest that Mueller’s report is not as much the definitive view of the former FBI director as a compendium of the conclusions of his aides — the hard-charging prosecutors Trump has branded as “13 Angry Democrats.”', 'One prominent lawyer close to Trump and Barr took that tack Thursday, saying that during Mueller’s tenure at the Justice Department he had a reputation for allowing his staff more leeway in drafting official memos and legal documents than other senior officials did.', '“Mueller doesn’t always control the pen as heavily as other officials might,” said the attorney, who said some lines in the report seemed “a little out of character” for the veteran prosecutor and ex-FBI chief.', '“I just assume some people on his team felt strongly and he wasn’t going to take them out,” added the Trump adviser, who requested anonymity.', 'Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s personal attorneys, said one difference he can see between Mueller and Barr centers on “how do you legally assess or interpret the situations that are alleged to be obstruction?” ', '“And I think that Barr has the classic approach to obstruction and I think some of Mueller’s staff have a much more expansive notion of it, which they may actually believe or they may be contorting because they’re pretty desperate to get the president,” the former mayor of New York said.', 'Glenn Kirschner, who worked as a homicide prosecutor under Mueller in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington D.C., predicted that the special counsel would eventually spell out his differences with Barr before Congress.', '“Mueller is not the kind of guy who is going to stand up at a press conference and disagree with the attorney general. He’s going to wait. He’s going to bide his time,” Kirschner said. “He will not let injustice stand. … He’ll set the record straight. All things in time.”', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

McFarland, to “draft an internal email that would confirm that the President did not direct Flynn to call the Russian Ambassador about sanctions.”', '“MacFarland told Priebus she did not know whether the President had directed Flynn to talk to [the Russian ambassador] about sanctions, and she declined to say yes or no to the request.”', '\n                                ', 'McFarland and another official considered the request “sufficiently irregular” to document it and raise concerns about it, the report says.', ""Mueller's team concluded that some of Trump's suspect actions seemed to have multiple motivations, which made it difficult to conclude whether the president had corrupt intent when he took certain steps, like firing Comey in May 2017."", '“Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true based on Comey’s representations,” the report says. “Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia investigation on his ability to govern.”', 'Mueller’s report found that the initial explanation Trump and the White House gave for firing Comey was “pretextual” and that Trump had already decided to fire Comey before Justice Department officials like Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein weighed in with critiques of Comey’s actions during an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.', 'The report also indicates that Rosenstein provided information to Mueller’s team that may have been unhelpful to Trump.', 'After White House officials asked the Justice Department to issue a statement saying it was Rosenstein’s idea to fire Comey, the deputy attorney general told aides that he wouldn’t put out a “false story,” according to the report.', 'Trump then called Rosenstein directly and urged him to hold a press conference about his role in the firing. “Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea, because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that Comey’s firing was not his idea,” the report says, citing accounts from Rosenstein and another DOJ lawyer.', 'Although Trump eventually conceded that he decided to fire Comey before getting those recommendations, “he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House’s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey’s termination,” the report states.', 'Mueller’s report also addresses a major question that has lingered since the public got the first glimpses of his findings in late March — why the special counsel’s team didn’t push for an interview with the president.

', ' and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.', 'Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind.', 'Story Continued Below', 'President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.', 'But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.', '“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”', 'Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.', '“He\'s brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He\'s going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""', 'It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.', 'Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.', '“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.', 'Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies. They worked together during the George W. Bush administration to oppose the CIA’s use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", and McCain ', ' Malinowski at his Senate confirmation hearing in September 2013. Malinowski ', ' McCain’s praise in a campaign advertisement shortly after the senator’s death.', 'The two men often butted heads over Obama’s foreign policy, even as they often agreed in private. Malinowski revealed to POLITICO that he worked behind the scenes to fight some of Obama’s most criticized foreign-policy decisions — most notably, the initial intervention into Yemen’s civil war by providing aid to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s poor record on human rights and Obama’s refusal to set up a no-fly zone over Syria despite his “red line” on chemical-weapons attacks.', 'McCain was, for decades, the go-to authority for congressional Republicans on foreign policy and national security matters — and a vocal critic of autocratic regimes. Democrats had their own hawkish ', 'until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.', 'In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though ', ' show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can ', ' of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.', 'It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a ', ' for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.', 'But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.', '“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.', '“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”', '***', 'For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?', '“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.', ""“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang."", '“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.', 'He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.', '“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.', '“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.', '“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.', 'It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.', '“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”', '***', 'Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.', 'Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.', '“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”', ""He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself."", '“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”', '“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”', '***', 'As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.', 'At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.', '“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”', 'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.', 'The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.', 'One of his final ', ' of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.', '“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”', '***', 'Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.', '“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”', 'But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.', 'During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in ', ', Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place. The Obama administration considered the U.S. to be formally engaged in hostilities in Yemen, Malinowski countered.', '\n                            Rep. Tom Malinowski listens to California Rep. Jimmy Panetta discuss legislation supporting NATO  on  Jan. 22, 2019.   | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo', '“If a foreign power was bombing Washington, D.C., and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over Chesapeake Bay on their way to drop ordnance on the Capitol building, we’d consider both countries to be at war with us, obviously,” Malinowski told me. “And if we’re refueling Saudi aircraft, if we’re servicing them on the tarmac, helping them get back into the air, we’re part of this conflict. And therefore need to make responsible decisions.”', 'Most — if not all — first-time members of Congress have never been in a classified briefing. Malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive branch experience when drawing their own conclusions. Every Democrat ended up voting in favor of the ', ', a remarkable and rare show of Democratic unity on a fraught foreign-policy issue.', '“Witnesses can’t get things by him,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.”', '***', 'Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.', '“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”', 'But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.', '“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”', '“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”', 'Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.', '“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.', 'On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.', 'Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.', '“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”', '***', 'Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.', 'House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.', 'His advice: Eyes on the prize.', '“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                    Updated ', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                    ', '\n                ', '\n                                ', ' © 2019 POLITICO LLC']"

But while Mueller’s original mandate directed him to pursue both a counterintelligence investigation and a criminal probe, his report contains no classified information, leaving unknown to the public anything he might have discovered in that category.', 'Here are five of the biggest unresolved subplots of the Russia investigation:', ' ', 'Even before Mueller was appointed, the FBI was examining why a computer server for Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest commercial bank — led by oligarchs with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin — had thousands of contacts with a server used by the Trump Organization between May and September 2016. A Slate report on the contacts based on research by computer scientists caused an online sensation just days before the election, until The New York Times ', ' that the FBI had concluded there could be what the paper called an “innocuous explanation” for the activity, like a marketing email or spam.', 'Many independent cybersecurity researchers and experts, many of whom worked at senior levels in the Pentagon, White House and intelligence community, have continued to insist that the timing and frequency of the server activity was not consistent with an automated process. “The timing of the communication was not random, and it wasn’t regular-periodic,” one researcher ', ' the New Yorker in October. “It was a better match for human activity.”', 'Innocuous or not, the server activity is not addressed in the Mueller report at all. The only discussion of Alfa Bank comes within the context of efforts by its CEO, Petr Aven, to connect with the Trump transition team in December 2016. Those efforts apparently were unsuccessful, according to Mueller, which may have led the special counsel’s office to dismiss the computer server activity as inconsequential. But there’s still no conclusive explanation for the pinging or why the Trump domain that Alfa was contacting abruptly disappeared two days after The New York Times', 'notified Alfa’s representatives in Washington of the server activity. ', 'One of the biggest subplots of the investigations into Russian election interference is the role the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica. But the company didn’t appear once in the report, despite indications that Mueller had questioned and subpoenaed former employees.', 'The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in summer 2016, and the company played a key role in trying to sway voters using pilfered Facebook data.', 'Beginning in 2014, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American who worked at the University of Cambridge, helped the firm harvest the raw data of up to 87 million Facebook profiles, which the company then used to microtarget political ads. There’s a WikiLeaks connection, too: Alexander Nix, the company’s CEO, has acknowledged reaching out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in summer 2016 to offer help organizing any Hillary Clinton-related emails WikiLeaks planned to release.', 'Mueller subpoenaed Brittany Kaiser, the former business development director for the firm, earlier this year. She told The Guardian that she was fully cooperating. Sam Patten, a Washington-based operative who began cooperating with Mueller’s probe last year after pleading guilty to an unrelated charge, worked at the Oregon office of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, in run-up to the 2014 midterm elections. And Mueller quizzed several digital experts who worked on Trump’s campaign about the big-data firm, according to ABC. ', 'Like the server activity, however, Cambridge Analytica is not mentioned at all in Mueller’s report. Therefore, it is still unclear what, if anything, the company knew about WikiLeaks’ plans or whether its microtargeting efforts were coordinated with the Russian’s information warfare campaign. ', ' Intriguingly, though, much of the portion of Mueller’s report dealing with Russia’s Internet Research Agency — which tasked internet trolls with spreading disinformation and propaganda during the presidential election — was redacted in the final report because of potential harm to ongoing investigations.', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', 'Since the 2016 presidential election, there have been numerous but vague data points indicating the Russians might be trying to infiltrate the National Rifle Association as a way to connect with Republicans and Trump’s campaign.', ""Mueller’s report, however, didn't shed any light on the subject, despite media reports that the special counsel was poking around on the subject."", 'The first indication of Mueller’s interest in the potential ties came earlier this year, when former Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told CNN the special counsel’s team had asked him about the campaign’s relationship with the NRA and the circumstances of a Trump speech to the group in 2015. The investigators continued asking witnesses about the campaign’s ties to the NRA as recently as December, according to CNN.', 'And July’s indictment of Mariia Butina, a Russian national who sought to infiltrate both the Trump campaign and the NRA before the election, also raised questions about the group’s status as a potential intermediary between Trump and the Russians. Butina was charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the Justice Department.', 'Butina was the first person to ask Trump in public about his position on Russian sanctions — during a 2015 event in Las Vegas — and tried to broker a meeting between Trump and her Russian handler, Alexander Torshin, at an NRA convention in May 2016.', 'McClatchy later reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators were investigating whether Torshin laundered money from Russia through the NRA to help fund Trump’s campaign — the NRA spent $30 million to support Trump in 2016, triple what it spent supporting Mitt Romney in 2012.', ""Despite the investigators’ interest, however, the gun rights group was not mentioned a single time in Mueller’s report. And Butina's case was handled by prosecutors in Washington, not Mueller’s team."", 'Mueller did answer one lingering question about Russian election hacking — how Kremlin agents got their digitally pilfered emails to WikiLeaks.', 'But he didn’t address the potentially more damning question: Did WikiLeaks know it was getting the material from Russian cutouts?', 'In his report, Mueller outlined in detail how Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, hacked Democrats during the campaign. Between March and April 2016, the report said, “the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks” and disseminated them both through GRU agents posing as independent hackers — including Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks — and WikiLeaks.', ""According to Mueller's report, the GRU used those fake online personas to shuttle some of its stolen cache to WikiLeaks. Through DCLeaks, the GRU initiated a conversation with WikiLeaks about transferring stolen documents on June 16, 2016. Eight days later, WikiLeaks reached out to Guccifer 2.0 via Twitter and asked for “any new material.”"", 'Mueller noted that Assange and WikiLeaks tried to obscure the source of the hacked materials by claiming in public statements that the DNC hack was an ""inside job"" carried out by Seth Rich, a murdered committee staffer, rather than Russia.', 'But the special counsel’s office either wouldn’t or couldn’t explain what WikiLeaks knew about the true identity of the hackers.', ""“Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the Office's ability to collect all of the communications between them,” the report said, pointing to their use of encryption."", 'That information could be relevant to determining whether WikiLeaks acted in a journalistic capacity, as Assange has maintained, or as a “non-state hostile intelligence service” abetted by Russia, as then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo claimed in April 2017.', 'Assange was arrested in London earlier this month after Ecuador withdrew his asylum. He faces U.S. criminal charges for allegedly trying to help former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack into a computer storing sensitive government files in 2010. ', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', ' Perhaps no element of the Trump-Russia scandal was as sensational as the claim, contained in an unverified dossier assembled during the campaign by former British spy Christopher Steele, that the Russians had ""kompromat"" on Trump in the form of video of him cavorting with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room. ', 'Although the alleged tape has consumed vast public attention over the past two years, Mueller mentions it only briefly. His report states that Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze texted then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen on Oct. 30, 2016 and said: ""Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there’s anything else. Just so you know .... "" Rtskhiladze told investigators that “tapes” referred to derogatory tapes of Trump rumored to be in the possession of the Agalarovs—a Russian-Azerbaijani family that hosted the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013.', 'Rtskhiladze told Mueller that he believed the tapes were fake. But for whatever reason, he didn’t tell that to Cohen, according to the report. Mueller does not draw a conclusion one way or the other. It remains unclear who might have been creating or disseminating such tapes, what their motive might have been — and whether anyone on Mueller’s team ever saw one or more of them.', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

0,Trump allies assail Mueller report even as they defend its conclusions,"['\n                Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani denounced special counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigation as ""one-sided"" and ""infected"" with bias. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images', '\n                        ', '\n                    By ', '\n                    Updated ', 'President Donald Trump’s allies fanned out in his defense on Sunday, taking a confrontational stance about the Mueller report and maintaining that even though the report did not lead to the president’s indictment, it was biased and built on a foundation of inappropriate logic and conduct.', 'Their combative tone, struck in a string of interviews across cable news, indicates that even as Trump and his allies have claimed exoneration, they are gearing up for another drawn-out fight. And the arguments they made previewed a line of defense as Congress prepares to pick up where Mueller left off — though Democrats continued to tread lightly on the issue of impeachment ahead of a strategizing huddle with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday.', 'Story Continued Below', 'Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani sparred with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, speaking with ABC’s Martha Raddatz, defended the president and found fault with the way the report was presented.', ""“That entire report, and the way you just presented it, is all from the point of, ‘Let's see if we can hang Donald Trump,’” Giuliani told Todd."", '“Go to Page 2 of the obstruction thing. The president’s got to prove he’s innocent. They have to be convinced that he didn’t do it. When is that the standard ever in America? How can you prove a negative?”', 'For Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, the investigation itself was the crime.', '“Where’s the interest now,” he said on NBC, “in trying to figure out how could it be that the FBI investigated this in two separate investigations, used four wiretaps in order to do it, four electronic surveillances, talked to 500 witnesses, spent $40 million, and the answer is there was no — not the slightest bit of evidence of conspiracy between Trump, anyone on the Trump campaign and the Russians? That was the story. Not this stuff which is underneath it.”', 'Giuliani argued that it was misleading for Trump’s critics to point out that Mueller hadn’t exonerated the president in declining to bring charges against him for collusion or obstruction of justice.', '“Exoneration means proving a negative,” Giuliani said to Wallace, calling the notion that Mueller’s report would need to exonerate Trump a “biased, warped view of a prosecutor’s role.”', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', 'Conway also took issue with many of Trump’s critics, as well as media reports, that have focused on the report’s explicitly noting that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”', '“The word exoneration was unnecessary in the Mueller report, and I would say inappropriate,” she said, adding: “You either prosecute or you don’t. You either bring an indictment or you don’t.”', 'Despite her quarrels with Mueller’s phrasing, Conway contended that the mere lack of charges against the president was exoneration in itself.', '“The job of a prosecutor is to gather evidence and decide whether to indict or to decline to indict,” she told Raddatz. “They declined to indict. The president is not going to jail, he’s staying in the White House for five and a half more years. Why? Because they found no crime, no conspiracy. That was the central premise.”', 'Though he said there would be no rebuttal from the president’s team just yet, Giuliani continued to question the report’s findings on obstruction even while lauding its findings that no one on the Trump campaign conspired to collude with Russia to sway the 2016 election.', '“A lot of things left off, a lot of things are false — I shouldn’t say a lot of things. Some things are false, a lot of things are questionable,” he said of the report.', 'On Sunday, Giuliani and Conway appeared to have settled on a similar line of attack going forward, questioning the credibility of those who played a key role in Mueller’s crafting of the obstruction portion. Trump previewed that argument on Friday, calling some of what his aides told Mueller “total bullshit.”', 'Giuliani and Conway both zeroed in Sunday on the testimony of someone who made frequent appearances in Mueller’s report: former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who spent 30 hours with the special counsel’s team.', 'According to the report — which Giuliani denounced as “one-sided” and “infected” with bias, despite hailing it for clearing the president legally — Trump asked McGahn to inform Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller was too conflicted to serve as special counsel, just days after media reports revealed that the special counsel was looking into whether Trump obstructed justice and for the first time was personally a target of the investigation. McGahn said he took this to mean Trump was asking him to remove Mueller from the investigation.', 'McGahn declined to fire Mueller, instead threatening to resign rather than do so, putting him in the company of numerous other presidential aides who shut down Trump’s attempts to thwart the investigation.', '“The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” the report states.', 'Trump’s team has pointed out that Trump never explicitly ordered McGahn to act, and that he told several slightly differing versions of the episode.', 'It’s an argument the president’s allies have fallen back on a number of times, including to dispute former FBI Director James Comey’s interpretation of Trump’s telling him to go easy on then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was also embroiled in the probe.', 'In his interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Giuliani asserted that McGahn’s account was not credible enough to hypothetically be put in front of a jury.', '\n                    ', '\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN and ', '“The guy has three different versions of something as important as this?” he asked. “You say I can’t rely on it.”', 'Giuliani added of McGahn: “I’m telling you, he’s confused.”', 'Though Giuliani seemed resigned to a congressional investigation of obstruction, he cast doubt on whether lawmakers could legally make a determination on whether Trump’s firing of Comey and his attempts to fire Mueller amounted to obstruction.', '“If they’re gonna review his removal power,” he said, there’s a “real question under Article 2 whether they can do that. The Constitution of the United States give the Congress a role in appointment, advise and consent; it deliberately doesn’t give them a role in removal because they say, go back to the Constitutional Convention, that would be too much of an intrusion.”', 'Even so, Giuliani contended about the possibility of removing Mueller, “had he done it, it would not have been obstruction of justice” because “there were very good reasons” to dismiss the special counsel due to perceived bias and conflicts of interests on Mueller’s team.', 'And, he continued, Trump would have known that firing Mueller would not have halted the investigation because of its continuing under different leadership when Trump fired Comey. On CNN, he accused investigators of not interviewing witnesses who would have backed up the Trump team’s version of events.', '“The second version is about as close to the truth as you’re going to get I think,” Giuliani said on CNN. “But the reality is there are independent witnesses they didn’t bother to interview who would say at that time the president was not taking the position that Mueller should be fired. In fact, Mueller was reassured he wouldn’t be fired. Those witnesses were not interviewed. Second, there are witnesses that dispute — a witness that disputes whether that’s correct.”', 'Despite Giuliani’s insistence that only Trump’s firing of Comey and his attempted removal of Mueller were in question regarding obstruction, the special counsel’s report lays out eight other episodes where the president potentially obstructed justice.', 'McGahn responded to the barrage of criticism over the weekend, telling NBC News he stood by his recollection of the episode, declaring that it was accurately described in the report and calling it a “mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to re-litigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction.”', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', 'Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which would be in charge of kicking off impeachment proceedings, said on Sunday that he planned to call McGahn to testify about his time in the White House. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he, too, wanted to hear from McGahn.', 'In his report, Mueller appeared to punt the issue of obstruction to lawmakers, writing that his office did not seek to make a “traditional prosecutorial decision” on obstruction because of longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president.', 'However, the report says: “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”', 'Nadler on Friday issued a subpoena for the unredacted report and its underlying evidence, including grand jury information, even though, he said on Sunday, the redacted version contained “plenty of evidence of obstruction.”', 'He also denied that Democrats had already moved to open an impeachment inquiry.', '“I don’t think we’re doing that,” Nadler said on “Meet the Press.” “We may get to that. We may not. As I’ve said before, it is our job to go through all the evidence, all the information we can get.”', 'Despite calls from a growing number of prominent voices — including two Democratic presidential candidates, Julian Castro and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — to initiate impeachment proceedings, Cummings and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urged caution at barging ahead with such a divisive case.', 'Schiff, on Fox, called it “a very difficult decision.”', '“We’re going to have a caucus about this over the next couple weeks to try to figure out what the best course is. Not for the party, but what’s the best course for the country,” he said, dinging Republicans, who have remained resolute in their opposition to impeachment. “I think it’s certainly the case that an impeachment would be unsuccessful if the Republican Party continues to place party above country, continues essentially to back the president no matter how unethical or dishonest his conduct may be, and sadly, that’s where we are right now.”', 'But he and Cummings both warned against inaction, with Schiff arguing that it might “signal that somehow this president’s conduct is OK, that future presidents can engage in this kind of corruption without consequence.”', 'Cummings worried that not taking any action would only “embolden” Trump, and said he wouldn’t rule out impeachment.', '“I’m not — I’m not there yet, but I can foresee that possibly coming,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” ', '“There comes a point in life where we all have to make decisions based upon the fact that it is our watch,” he said. “And, you know, history, I think even if we did not win possibly, if there were not impeachment, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution.” ', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

His body was never found, but there are indications that he was kidnapped and flown to the Dominican Republic, where he may have been killed.', 'The unsolved 62-year-old mystery, which also sweeps in the death of an American pilot and two trials in Washington of a man charged with being an unregistered Dominican Republic agent, is so colorful and convoluted that it inspired a 2003 film starring Harvey Keitel, “The Galindez File.”', ""McKeever, 82, wants a judge to release secret testimony given to a DC-based grand jury that investigated Galindez's disappearance. But the Justice Department argues that judges don’t have “inherent authority” to release such information unless it falls under exemptions approved by Congress, which don’t apply in the Galindez case — or in many others, including potentially Mueller’s investigation."", '“I’ve been on the journey almost 40 years to tell this story,” McKeever said Sunday in a phone interview from his South Carolina home. “The Justice Department does not want this case to break the dam.”', 'The arguments in McKeever’s case next month will take place at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington — two floors above where Mueller’s grand jury meets. ', 'A spokesman for Mueller’s office declined to comment on whether his team is tracking the McKeever case, but one lawyer closely following the Trump-Russia probe said Mueller’s allies are aware of the problems the McKeever case could cause for the special counsel.', '“There are people who are interested in the options open to Mr. Mueller and his investigation who recognize the potential significance of this case,” said Philip Lacovara, an attorney who served as a prosecutor on the Watergate special counsel team. “It certainly could complicate matters.”', 'If Democrats win control of the House in November, the whole debate is likely academic. In that scenario, the House Judiciary Committee could subpoena any report as part of an impeachment inquiry. A judge would likely approve that request because of ', ' in 1974 that approved transmission of a report to the House on President Richard Nixon’s actions in Watergate.

At issue is a federal court rule that governs grand jury secrecy and lays out several exceptions permitting disclosures. There is no exemption in the rule that explicitly authorizes a report to the public or to Congress for potential use in impeachment proceedings.', 'The law used to appoint independent counsels in the 1980s and 1990s had a provision for such a report to Congress and was the mechanism used for the 1998 report that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.', 'However, that law expired in 1999. Mueller was appointed under Justice Department regulations that are similar to the earlier statute,', 'but there’s no provision in those rules that ensures secret grand jury testimony can be made public, as there was under the old independent counsel law.', 'Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said Mueller’s office is preparing a report on his findings, but the exact mechanism by which it would be disclosed is unclear. Experts on grand jury secrecy say the public assumption that Mueller can simply publish his conclusions could be wrong, especially if the appeals court sides with the Justice Department in the McKeever case next month.', '“The question of how information obtained by Mueller in his investigation will ultimately become public is a pressing one, and it’s a complicated question,” Whiting said. ', 'Adding to the political drama around the McKeever case: the judges drawn to decide it. The three-judge panel announced by the court last week leans Republican, which is unusual since most of the D.C. Circuit’s active judges are Democrats. In addition, the panel will include the appeals court’s only Trump appointee, Judge Greg Katsas. Also assigned to the case: Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, and Judge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee.', 'The McKeever case is already affecting another politically sensitive disclosure fight: a pending request from CNN for access to records of various grand jury court battles during the Clinton years.', 'Last week, the Justice Department agreed to release a special master’s report from one of those cases. The report, detailing an investigation into alleged grand jury leaks, did not mention Brett Kavanaugh, the Trump Supreme Court nominee who served as a member of independent counsel Ken Starr’s staff. ', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', 'A Justice Department spokesman declined to explain why the agency approved release of that report but is fighting to keep information in other grand jury-related cases under wraps. However, the spokesman pointed to a legal brief where Justice attorneys argued that the special master’s report did not contain any grand jury secrets that had not previously been released.', 'There are ways the D.C. Circuit panel could defuse the McKeever case without impacting Mueller. For instance, the judges could send the matter back to the district court to consider a narrowed request the author has made for the records related to his case. The appeals court panel could also say explicitly that it is not opining on potential disclosures to Congress or those regarding impeachment inquiries.', '“It depends on how narrowly or broadly they want to write the opinion,” said Boston College law professor Mike Cassidy, an expert on grand juries.', 'Cassidy said there are precedents for grand juries releasing public reports, particularly at the state and local level, as with the one issued last week in Pennsylvania over sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests.', 'At least two other appeals courts, the New York-based 2nd Circuit and the Chicago-based 7th Circuit, have issued rulings that found judges could order grand jury-related disclosures that weren’t explicitly authorized elsewhere. ', 'McKeever says he’s not as concerned about the impact his case could have on the Mueller probe as he is about the prospect that he could be denied information that could shed light on what he believes is possible U.S. government involvement in the disappearance of the Columbia professor, Galindez, who was a critic of the dictator and U.S. ally who led the Dominican Republic at the time, Rafael Trujillo. ', 'McKeever says he worries that the appeals court could issue a ruling that shuts down historians, authors and journalists from being able to investigate cases that grand juries dropped or didn’t finish.
