The more difficult question would involve any allegations separate and apart from Russia, he said.", "\"This gives him the authority to pull on all kinds of string and see where they lead him,\" Buell said. \"As long as you're following a string that's connected to the string of Russian influence on the election \u2014 however that may have occurred, whoever that may have involved \u2014 would seem to fall within that appointment.\"", "Manafort's work in Ukraine continued at least through the beginning of 2014, when Yanukovych's government was ousted amid protests of widespread corruption and his rejection of a European trade deal in favor of one with Moscow. As the AP reported last year, that work included covertly directing a lobbying campaign on behalf of Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions in Washington. Following the AP's reporting on emails in which Manafort deputy Rick Gates was overseeing the work, two lobbying firms involved in the project registered as foreign agents.

They're part of the executive branch and the idea of the FBI with all of its authority, all of its power and it has an enormous amount of power, turning that power in a direction against a duly elected President of the United States is appalling unless there was some reasonable ground to believe that the President was engaged in criminal conduct or that the President had become an agent of a foreign government.", "There is, to me, zero evidence that President Trump whether one who loves him or does not love him, was in any way an agent of any foreign power. He had relationships, obviously, but who doesn't who is coming into the presidency?

At a minimum, that's the kind of decision, if there was something that's seriously wrong in the view of the FBI, they go knock on the Attorney General's office and the Attorney General goes and knocks on the Counsel of the President's office, and you do this through regular order as opposed to essentially runaway cops.", "LEVIN: But I'm trying to figure out what exactly did he do that would merit this kind of rogue hysteria. He fires the FBI Director. It's the FBI Director. He is allowed to fire the FBI Director. He is allowed to fire pretty much whomever he wishes. It had no effect on the Russian investigation. The Russian investigation has expanded into all kinds of areas. The President hasn't interfered with their funding.", "As a matter of fact, Mr. McCabe testified under oath before Congress that everything is going along swimmingly with the Russian investigation, that they've gotten all the funds that they need. There is no evidence of obstruction, per se, the President has the inherent power to hire and fire pretty much as he wishes. This seemed to me to be a pretext. What do you think?", "STARR: I don't know if it is a pretext or just an abysmal misunderstanding of our constitutional order and the power of the President. We do not have an imperial presidency. There are many checks and there are many balances especially the United States Congress, especially the House of Representatives. If something has gone awry, the founding generation said we want that judgment as to whether to put the impeachment process in place in the people's House, not in the Senate, but in the people's House.

That kind of discussion took place, too. So it's important that the American people understand context, understand precedent. We're told these things going on today have never happened before.", "The things going on today that had never happened before as far as I'm concerned involves a lot of what's taking place at the FBI.

First Comey clears Hillary Clinton in a bizarre press conference. He doesn't even talk to the Attorney General. One of the things the Inspector General complained about was that he undermined her authority, that's the Attorney General's decision whether somebody is charged or prosecuted, not the Director the FBI.", "Then a few days before the election, \"Oh, we have more e-mails,\" and then quickly over the weekend they say, \"But don't worry everything's fine,\" and then we have this General Counsel now saying or who said, \"I thought she should have been charged all along but I was convinced at the end.\" What do you make of what took place at the FBI?", "STARR: The FBI should have been in full consultation with the Justice Department. He used the term, Mark, \"undermining\" the authority of the Attorney General by the way Jim Comey conducted himself. I would say he usurped authority and that's what the Rod Rosenstein memo said in May leading up to the firing of James Comey by the President of the United States.", "I wish the President had taken this action much earlier. I think we would have avoided an enormous amount of grief had he because Jim Comey and you and I are both alums of the Justice Department and we know the hierarchy and he knew the hierarchy. He had served in the Justice Department, so this was not inadvertent. He took the authority of the Attorney General and assumed that for himself.", "And then there may have been a very weak legal analysis going into the usurpation of authority that is a misreading of the statute because Mr. Baker, the former General Counsel was after all the General Counsel. He is the lawyer to the FBI and so you would think that his view would carry a special weight in terms of the meaning of the statute and he thought, according to the testimony that we're now seeing that she had in fact committed crimes.", "One of the reasons that I chose to write this book about the Clinton investigation is we felt that Hillary Clinton was guilty of crimes in the Arkansas phase of the investigation. We couldn't prove it. Prosecutors will frequently say there's a difference between what I know and what I can prove and because of missing witnesses -- Susan McDougal for example would not agree to testify, she went into contempt of court. The name of the book, \"Contempt,\" the President was held in contempt.", "But the point is, the Independent Counsel statute contemplates working with the FBI, but it wasn't the FBI that was making these decisions as to whether to prosecute Jim Guy Tucker or anyone else, it was the responsibility of the Justice Department or the Independent Counsel.", "LEVIN: So in this FBI, you had at least some of them pushing for the 25th Amendment, yet they are making decisions they had no power to make. I would say to either Jim Comey or McCabe, we had a rogue FBI. We'll be right back.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "LEVIN: Ken Starr, I want to ask you about Congressional oversight. The Democrats have multiple committees starting multiple investigations on anything you can think of, related to Trump and Trump world. Now, you know I look at the Constitution, I look at the history of hearings, the history of what Congress does and maybe when it shouldn't do. It has legitimate oversight function. There's no question about that, its job is to legislate. So it kind of needs to know what's going on, but that's not what's going on.", "If you want ten years of the President's past tax returns, when you want access to the Deutsche Bank information from the past and they say, \"We need to look at these things also because of potential impeachment.\" It talks about high crimes and misdemeanors among other things while he's President of the United States.", "The American people elected this man despite the fact he wouldn't release his tax returns, and by the way, Members of Congress aren't required to release their tax returns either including Nancy Pelosi.", "If I'm the President in the United States and I've got good lawyers and I say, \"You know what, I'm not giving you that information. You have no legitimate legislative basis for it whatsoever other than to try and harass me, to try and ruin my businesses and my family, so I'll see you in court, ultimately I'll see in the Supreme Court.\" What's your take on this?", "STARR: I think you're on to something. The legislative oversight power is in furtherance of the responsibilities given to Congress under Article 1, conducting a tax investigation is nowhere near the powers of Congress under Article 1 Section 8 and it's almost sounding in the nature of a bill of attainder, it's violating the idea of we don't pass laws or investigate individuals qua-individuals unless it's relating again to our legislative function. What is it that we're elected to do? We're here to oversee the executive branch and to pass laws and so forth.", "So I think there is a serious question under separation of powers and I am so glad that you mention that because too many times, as we march on in our third century as a Constitutional Republic, we don't return to these fundamental constitutional principles of, \"Wait a second, what's your job, Congress?\" \"Mr. President, are you exceeding your powers?\" \"Courts, are you exceeding your powers?\" These are questions that we should continually ask and I think it's a very important question in terms of seeking the President's tax returns.", "LEVIN: And you and I discuss these things, very few other people do. The debate over the report is when will it be released? What will it contain? Not a debate over the fact of a report. The debate over congressional investigations isn't a debate over, \"Well, what are they allowed to investigate under our Constitution? What are the limits as opposed to, well they get 10 years of tax returns or what will be in the tax returns?", "STARR: It needs to relate to the legislative authority and legislative power.", "LEVIN: Exactly, and yet our media really do the drumbeat for this sort of thing. They're not particularly informed or literate in these areas and they don't particularly care to be. Your dealings with the media we're very difficult and yet from time to time, you found reporters, I think who were real reporters. Tell me about that.", "STARR: There's no question. I've divided the media during the investigation resulting now in this book into truth seekers and everybody else, and the good news is, during that time, there were some serious truth seekers. Jeff Gerth of the \"New York Times,\" Steve Labaton of the \"New York Times,\" Sue Schmidt of the \"Washington Post,\" Lisa Myers of NBC News who broke the Juanita Broderick story, a very inflammatory story that the then Attorney General of Arkansas and the future President perhaps committed actual forcible rape.", "These were real truth-seeking people and then there were those who were in the other camp, non-truth seekers.", "LEVIN: They were heavily outnumbered, weren't they?", "STARR: I seem to see -- I wanted to see more truth seekers than we had and so, a lot of the material that went out into the public domain was essentially an echo chamber from what White House press spokespeople were saying, criticisms of the investigation, let's change the subject, let's attack the investigator and one of the things that Hillary, of course, was extremely effective at doing as a student of Saul Alinsky and rules for radicals is, \"Go after and destroy the other side.\"", "LEVIN: Personalize, target the person. They did it to you. Do you think that's being done to the President of the United States right now? Can you get hurt on a cable show without him being called a racist or a Nazi or Stalinist or a dictator or the person who's triggered this kind of action and that kind of action? I mean, I can't.", "STARR: I wish there was a restoration of civility. Recently, the American Charter of Conscience was released and that American Charter, I wish were in every journalist must-read package because it's one of the other things that says, \"Look, we have to disagree with one another and hopefully we don't have to, but we should choose to disagree with one another in a much more civil way and to be respectful of one another.\"", "But this constant calling into question motives and the name-calling and so forth has just resulted, I think in the American people saying, \"You know, I really don't like this. I don't like the tone, don't like the attitude and so forth,\" and I think everybody needs to just stop yelling at one another and have a more reasoned discourse.", "LEVIN: Don't forget folks, almost every weeknight, you can watch me on Levin TV.

I've never understood what that means by the way. Does that mean you have a drink with a Russian? I mean, I have Russian heritage, if I talk to the President, is that a Russian thing? So it's this ambiguous term \"colluding\" with the Russians and it's ambiguous for a reason because you can pour whatever mental image you have into that and yet the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, he's not a showboat. He's a pretty quiet guy.", "STARR: Yes.", "LEVIN: He seems to be trying to do a studious job. I don't know him. He's cornered by CBS or NBC or both. He says, \"We haven't found any direct evidence of any collusion.\" Now, other than a quick hit in the media, I don't see that being pounded as \"Breaking News\" you know, you're always, \"Breaking News,\" \"Alert, alert. Breaking News. No collusion found.\"", "And then you have 14 shows talk about it. Where's the Russia collusion? You have thousands of journalists looking. You have hundreds of members of Congress looking, you have Federal prosecutors looking. There's leaks all over the place, people writing books all over the place. You would think if there's evidence of collusion, whatever that is, we'd see it by now. Am I wrong?", "STARR: I don't think you're wrong at all. There apparently is no evidence of collusion, certainly not in the public domain and I think we have more than that, Mark. We have contraindications and those are the two indictments returned under Bob Mueller's aegis against the 13 Russian individuals and the two Russian organizations and when you read those two indictments, what you see is the Russians were up to no good and it's a speaking indictment. It tells a story and the story that's told is essentially a non-collusion story.", "There didn't need to be any collusion because why? The Russian organizations were lavishly financing these operatives who were using false identification and so forth, committing crimes. It's not just skunk works in the political sense, they were doing all kinds of things, using false pretenses and so forth and here was one of the keys that I think shows no collusion.", "On the very same day, these Russian operatives financed in New York City, a pro-Trump rally and an anti-Trump rally on the very same day. They're just trying to sow seeds of discord, so to my knowledge, you're exactly right. There's no evidence of collusion.", "LEVIN: This indict -- these indictments of these Russians, and they'll never see the inside of a U.S. courtroom of course. They're indicted for activities that occurred when who was President the United States?", "STARR: President Obama.", "LEVIN: President Obama. These activities in the FBI took place when who was President the United States? The Department of Justice? Who was President of the United States? I am flabbergasted that there isn't the media paparazzi chasing Barack Obama and asking him wittingly or unwittingly, did he know about any of this and if he didn't, what kind of administration was he running?", "This was his Department of Justice. Clapper worked for him. Brennan worked for him. Susan Rice worked for him. We saw the unmasking. A record number of unmasking of individuals, citizens in the last year of the Obama administration. We hear nothing about Barack Obama, the Obama administration.", "Harry Truman used to say, \"The buck stops here.\" But apparently, that's not the case in the Obama administration. What accounts for this?", "STARR: Well, the book needs to be written and it hasn't been written yet, so there is something that needs to be done in terms of investigative reporting to find out, well, what was the Obama administration doing in light of what they knew was going on, which was this Russian interference with our campaigns?", "But we have to note that the Obama administration itself had interfered in the Israeli campaign and chose their approved winner --", "LEVIN: Trying to take out Netanyahu.", "STARR: Tried to take out Netanyahu and so forth.", "LEVIN: Anybody been indicted for that?", "STARR: To my knowledge, no. I'm not even sure there was an investigation of that. It may not even be a violation of Federal law, but it clearly is a violation of Federal law for the Russians to be doing what they were doing, so I'm glad these indictments were returned, but there was strange silence out of the White House while this was underway and in a way that who knows what the eventual result would be. You have to predict.", "But what you do know is you've got a foreign power trying to interfere with a Presidential election.

One for Republican Presidents and one for Democratic Presidents? Do you think the American people feel that we have two systems of justice in this country?", "STARR: I fear that the American people are inclined in that especially those who are supporters of the President and they say, \"Well, why wasn't Hillary called to justice with the server?

We've got to -- it has got to be a job for Bill Bar and then the new Deputy Attorney General and frankly it's a job for Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI right now who needs to, I think, be much more public in the restoration of public confidence.", "LEVIN: We only have a few seconds.

{"title": "Read the Mueller report findings: Barr\u2019s letter to Congress", "body": ["A summary of the Mueller report findings, according to Attorney General William Barr\u2019s letter to top lawmakers.", "TEXT VERSION BELOW:", "On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a \"confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\" he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.8(c). This report is entitled \"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.\" Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.", "The report explains that the\u00a0Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations. In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.", "The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed. During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action. The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel's report.", ". The Special Counsel's report is divided into two parts. The first describes the results of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts. The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel's investigation was whether any Americans - including individuals associated with the Trump campaign - joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: \"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"", "The Special Counsel's investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election. As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.", "The second element involved the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple. offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.", ". The report's second part addresses a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting - that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a \"thorough factual investigation\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \"difficult issues\" of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel states that \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"", "The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel's office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel's obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.", "In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of\u00ad-justice offense.", "The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel's report will be a\u00a0\"confidential report\" to the Attorney General. See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,038,\u00a037,040-41 (July 9, 1999). As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter. For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.", "Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to \"matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id.
