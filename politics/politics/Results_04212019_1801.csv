It also details an effort to pressure staffers to send an email exonerating him and notes that the president had more knowledge of an aide’s potentially criminal behavior than he may have let on. "", ""One implication of the report is that Trump may have escaped a finding that he obstructed justice only because his top aides refused to carry out his most dramatic orders. Indeed, Mueller’s team describes several of Trump's actions as satisfying all the legal elements of obstruction."", 'The 448-page report is the culmination of a nearly two-year-long investigation that has cast a shadow over Trump’s time in office as questions swirled around whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Moscow intermediaries to sway the 2016 election, and whether the president tried to impede an investigation into the matter.', '\n                                ', 'While the exhaustive document confirms that Mueller found no conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin, it contains numerous unfavorable observations regarding potential obstruction of justice and sheds light on why the special counsel chose to neither exonerate Trump nor conclude that he committed a crime. ', 'Perhaps most notably, Mueller’s prosecutors said that while Trump seemed confident the FBI would not uncover a conspiracy between his campaign and Moscow, he was still concerned about what else they might find. Among his anxieties were the ongoing attempts during the 2016 campaign to seek business in Russia, including an attempt to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.', '“The evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns,” the report states. ', 'The passage could speak to Trump’s intent when he took several actions that investigators and some of his own aides flagged as potential attempts to impede the authorities. ', 'In recent weeks, Attorney General William Barr has emphasized Trump’s intent as he explained his decision to not pursue an obstruction case against the president, even though Mueller chose not to make such a definitive conclusion.', '“It is important to bear in mind the context,” Barr said at a Thursday morning press conference. “There was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability,” Barr added. “Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.”', '\n                                ', 'Mueller’s team seemed far less definitive about Trump’s mindset regarding potential obstruction.', '“If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment,” the report says in a 182-page section dedicated to obstruction.', '“Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” it continues.', 'The passage is particularly notable as it contains the full context of a line Barr used in an initial March 24 letter he released summarizing the principal conclusions of Mueller’s report. Barr chose only to include a portion of the final sentence, frustrating Democrats, some former DOJ officials and even some on Mueller’s team, who felt that the selective editing narrowly presented the special counsel’s findings.', 'Barr also proactively announced in his March letter that he would not bring an obstruction case against the president, further irritating Democrats.', 'Mueller’s report leaves open the possibility that Trump could at least in theory face prosecution for criminal acts after he leaves office. Mueller’s prosecutors decided, therefore, that a criminal investigation of the president was appropriate.', 'However, Mueller’s team said making a decision about whether crimes were committed would have gone too far. Long-standing DOJ legal guidance dating to Watergate says a sitting president can’t be indicted.', 'In a lengthy analysis, the report explains that claiming the president obstructed justice without the ability to charge him would taint his presidency and damage his ability to govern — leaving him with no legal recourse to clear his name or protections normally afforded to criminal defendants.', '“Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought,” the report says.', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', ', ', ', ', ' and ', 'Still, the report details a number of incidents of presidential meddling that Mueller and even Trump’s own aides found troubling.

In total, 40 percent of pages have at least one redaction, although only 14 percent of the obstruction pages have blacked out passages.', 'The obstruction section unveils new details about a much-scrutinzed discussion Trump had with former FBI Director James Comey. According to Comey, Trump leaned on him to drop an investigation into one-time national security adviser Michael Flynn regarding an untruthful interview with the FBI.', 'The Mueller report says when that conversation occurred, Justice Department officials had already told White House counsel Don McGahn that Flynn’s conduct could be considered unlawful, and that McGahn related that information to the president.', 'The report also says that Trump repeatedly directed McGahn to dissuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Trump-Russia probe, given his integral role in the Trump campaign.', '“McGahn continued trying [on] behalf of the President to avert Sessions’ recusal by speaking to Sessions’s personal counsel, Sessions’s chief of staff and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself,” Mueller’s team wrote.', 'After the recusal was announced, Trump pulled Sessions aside during a weekend visit to Mar-a-Lago and suggested he “unrecuse,” the report says.', '\n                    ', '\n                    By ', ', ', ' and ', ""Trump's ire for McGahn is apparent in several of the document’s passages. One section recounts that after The New York Times reported that Trump had requested McGahn fire Mueller, the president few into a rage, calling McGahn a “lying bastard” in a conversation with White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Trump demanded that McGahn write a letter denying the firing request, but McGahn declined."", 'Indeed, the report recounts at least two occasions in June 2017 when Trump asked McGahn to order that DOJ dismiss Mueller.', 'Trump said firing Mueller was justified because of what the president considered conflicts of interest, like an alleged dispute related to Mueller’s membership in a Virginia golf club Trump acquired and issues raised by Mueller being briefly considered for a Trump nomination as FBI director. ', 'McGahn told Mueller’s office that he viewed those supposed conflicts as “silly” and “not real,” and resolved not to carry out Trump’s directive. After a second phone call from Trump in one day about the issue, McGahn began to take steps to resign, the report says. “McGahn recalled feeling trapped. ... McGahn decided he had to resign,” Mueller’s team wrote. “He then drove to the office to pack his belongings and submit his resignation letter.” ', 'While McGahn was talked out of resigning at that point, he eventually left the administration in October 2018.', 'The report also said Trump once dressed down McGahn for his note-taking practice. “What about these notes? Why do you take notes? I never had a lawyer who takes notes,” the president declared, according to McGahn.', 'McGahn said he replied that he keeps notes because he’s a “real lawyer,” the report says.', 'Trump also once tried to get a senior adviser to send an email insisting that he had not ordered Flynn to discuss economic sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the presidential transition period.', 'Questions have long lingered about how much involvement Trump had in the incident, which Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying about to the FBI amid questions about whether the incoming Trump administration was seeking to undermine economic penalties the Obama administration had just imposed on Moscow.', 'According to Mueller’s report, Trump asked his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to get Flynn’s deputy, K.T. McFarland, to “draft an internal email that would confirm that the President did not direct Flynn to call the Russian Ambassador about sanctions.”', '“MacFarland told Priebus she did not know whether the President had directed Flynn to talk to [the Russian ambassador] about sanctions, and she declined to say yes or no to the request.”', '\n                                ', 'McFarland and another official considered the request “sufficiently irregular” to document it and raise concerns about it, the report says.', ""Mueller's team concluded that some of Trump's suspect actions seemed to have multiple motivations, which made it difficult to conclude whether the president had corrupt intent when he took certain steps, like firing Comey in May 2017."", '“Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true based on Comey’s representations,” the report says. “Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia investigation on his ability to govern.”', 'Mueller’s report found that the initial explanation Trump and the White House gave for firing Comey was “pretextual” and that Trump had already decided to fire Comey before Justice Department officials like Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein weighed in with critiques of Comey’s actions during an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.', 'The report also indicates that Rosenstein provided information to Mueller’s team that may have been unhelpful to Trump.', 'After White House officials asked the Justice Department to issue a statement saying it was Rosenstein’s idea to fire Comey, the deputy attorney general told aides that he wouldn’t put out a “false story,” according to the report.', 'Trump then called Rosenstein directly and urged him to hold a press conference about his role in the firing. “Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea, because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that Comey’s firing was not his idea,” the report says, citing accounts from Rosenstein and another DOJ lawyer.', 'Although Trump eventually conceded that he decided to fire Comey before getting those recommendations, “he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House’s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey’s termination,” the report states.', 'Mueller’s report also addresses a major question that has lingered since the public got the first glimpses of his findings in late March — why the special counsel’s team didn’t push for an interview with the president. The question took on greater importance Thursday morning, when Barr emphasized at a news conference that he believed Trump’s intent was critical to determining whether the president was trying to stymie the Russia probe with his actions.', '“We also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed,” Mueller’s team wrote.

He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind.', 'Story Continued Below', 'President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.', 'But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.', '“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”', 'Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.', '“He\'s brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He\'s going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""', 'It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.', 'Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.', '“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.', 'Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies.

Democrats had their own hawkish ', 'until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.', 'In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though ', ' show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can ', ' of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.', 'It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a ', ' for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.', 'But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.', '“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.', '“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”', '***', 'For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?', '“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.', ""“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang."", '“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.', 'He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.', '“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.', '“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.', '“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.', 'It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.', '“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”', '***', 'Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.', 'Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.', '“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”', ""He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself."", '“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”', '“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”', '***', 'As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.', 'At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.', '“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”', 'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.', 'The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.', 'One of his final ', ' of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.', '“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”', '***', 'Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.', '“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”', 'But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.', 'During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in ', ', Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place. The Obama administration considered the U.S. to be formally engaged in hostilities in Yemen, Malinowski countered.', '\n                            Rep. Tom Malinowski listens to California Rep. Jimmy Panetta discuss legislation supporting NATO  on  Jan. 22, 2019.   | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo', '“If a foreign power was bombing Washington, D.C., and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over Chesapeake Bay on their way to drop ordnance on the Capitol building, we’d consider both countries to be at war with us, obviously,” Malinowski told me. “And if we’re refueling Saudi aircraft, if we’re servicing them on the tarmac, helping them get back into the air, we’re part of this conflict. And therefore need to make responsible decisions.”', 'Most — if not all — first-time members of Congress have never been in a classified briefing. Malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive branch experience when drawing their own conclusions. Every Democrat ended up voting in favor of the ', ', a remarkable and rare show of Democratic unity on a fraught foreign-policy issue.', '“Witnesses can’t get things by him,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.”', '***', 'Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.', '“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”', 'But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.', '“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”', '“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”', 'Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.', '“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.', 'On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.', 'Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.', '“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”', '***', 'Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.', 'House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.', 'His advice: Eyes on the prize.', '“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”', 'Missing out on the latest scoops?

Instead he tore into his political opponents for pushing “this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud” that has hung over his entire presidency.', '“This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people,” he claimed, adding that he expects that Democrats will now face a moment of reckoning.', '“They’re on artificial respirators right now.

A Harvard-Harris survey released earlier Thursday found Trump’s approval rating unchanged from a similar poll conducted last month.', 'According to one outside adviser to the president’s re-election effort, rallies like the one held Thursday are an “ideal opportunity for the president to test new messages, including new attacks against 2020 Democrats, and to remind voters of his accomplishments.” With the exception of an off-script complaint about the late Republican Sen.

', ' “It would have been better had I used a second email account,” Clinton said, saying she had decided in 2008 before becoming secretary of state to use only one account “for convenience.” “Looking back, it would have been smarter to use two devices,” she said, insisting that she had sent all “work-related” emails to the State Department and hailing the department’s decision, announced Tuesday, to make them available online. ', 'Story Continued Below', ' At the same time, Clinton said she believed she had complied with State Department rules at the time and had not been under any obligation to use an official government email account. ', ' “I believe I have met all of my responsibilities. The server will remain private,” Clinton said. ', ' But Clinton vociferously defended her decision not to share personal details of her life, such as wedding planning, yoga lessons and decisions about her mother’s funeral. “In the end, I decided not to keep my private emails,” Clinton said. ', ' Asked whether she had been briefed on security concerns about her email setup, Clinton refused to answer directly, but volunteered that she had sent no classified emails and that there had been no security breeches of her private server. ', ' Throughout the brief question-and-answer session at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan, Clinton repeatedly deflected another key question asked by several reporters: Just how, and in what way, might this episode affect her plans to run for president in 2016. ', ' Clinton was responding to reports last week that she relied exclusively on a private email address during her four years as secretary of state, rather than an official account where the messages would likely have become part of her agency’s historical records. The Associated Press later reported that the emails were channeled through a private server registered to her suburban New York residence, to channel her messages. ', ' Meanwhile, the White House acknowledged Monday that President Barack Obama traded emails with Clinton on her private account but was said he unaware how the account was set up or that messages were not being saved in a federal archive. ', ' “The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,” said press secretary Josh Earnest. “I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.” ', ' Obama told CBS in an interview Saturday that he’d learned of Clinton’s use of a private e-mail address and server “through news reports.” However, Earnest conceded Monday that Obama knew Clinton was communicating from a private e-mail account, but was unaware of how that mail was handled or that Clinton did not have an official “state.gov” account. ', ' “Yes, the president was aware of her email address,” Earnest said. “He was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act.” ', ' The pressure on Clinton has ratcheted up as critics, including some congressional Democrats, have called on her to publicly address the reports. ', ' In December, Clinton sent 50,000 pages of emails from the private account to the State Department at its request. The agency recently turned over 900 pages of emails from Clinton’s account to a House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks in 2012. ', ' But critics have argued that Clinton’s handling of the issue as left her and her staff totally in control of screening emails and deciding which ones are responsive to government requests. ', ' Both the White House and the State Department brushed aside suggestions from that panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), that his panel may not have received all Libya-related emails. Gowdy said Clinton produced no emails from a time period when she traveled to Libya and was photographed using her BlackBerry. ', '\n  ', ' ', ' “Maybe she was using her BlackBerry to read the news,” Earnest said. “You can use your Blackberry for other things other than email, right?” ', ' State spokeswoman Jen Psaki took a similar tack, arguing that there was nothing suspicious about any gaps in the e-mail record. ', ' “I wasn’t on that trip [but] I’ve been on trips with the current secretary where there are communications issues, where you really don’t send emails,” the spokeswoman said. ', ' Earnest also said the White House had allowed the State Department to manage its own response to the latest House Benghazi inquiry. ', ' “I would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress that [Gowdy would] be complaining about that on national television as well,” the press secretary added. ', ' The White House suggested Monday that concerns were misplaced about the process Clinton used to produce her emails after the State Department requested them in October. ', ' But Earnest did not come down squarely for or against proposals that a neutral party verify that all work-related e-mails have been produced. Clinton allies suggested Sunday that she would be open to such a review. ', ' “I haven’t heard anybody or seen anybody present any evidence to indicate that [Clinton’s aides] didn’t do what they said they did,” Earnest declared. “If Secretary Clinton’s team decides that they want to go to greater lengths than they already have that ultimately is a decision for them to make.” ', ' The fact that Obama corresponded with Clinton via a private server stoked fears that the arrangement increased the risks that either of them could have been hacked or that messages between them could have been intercepted more readily than communications between two “.gov” email accounts. ', ' However, cybersecurity experts said that was not necessarily the case, since communications between government e-mail servers handling unclassified information are not always encrypted or directly connected. ', ' “There is no top-level, [Office of Management and Budget]-driven, thou-shalt-run a common-network-with-a-common-backbone, which is what we were trying to get years ago, but could just never do it,” said one expert who worked on cybersecurity issues in the George W. Bush White House and asked not to be named. E-mails “could go directly from one to another, but that depends on those two [agencies’ technology leaders’] getting together and engineering some kind of cross-connect.” ', ' The former official said that proposals over the last decade to create a government-only network went by the wayside. ', ' “The grand idea of connecting the entire federal government on fiber that’s only for the government – that’s about as practical as building a highway system that’s just for the government. Way too expensive to install, maintain and operate. So then you fall back on, okay, we’ll use commercial fiber,” the official said. ', ' The White House declined to comment Monday on whether Obama’s communication with Clinton through her private address posed any security risks or if those risks had been mitigated in some fashion. ', ' “One of the security precautions we take around the president’s email is we don’t talk about it very [much] publicly,” Earnest said, while acknowledging that policy had been breached somewhat in recent days. ', ' At the State Department, Psaki said there was no indication that the content of Clinton’s e-mail account was compromised, although she changed her address in 2011 after a hacker obtained it and posted it online. ', ' ”We don’t have any reason to believe that” outsiders gained access to her account,” the spokeswoman said. “Obviously her email wasn’t hacked.” ', ' Clinton’s expected effort to tackle questions at a press conference about her e-mail use poses risks for the former secretary, who is expected to officially announce her 2016 campaign for the White House in the next month or so. For one, she is out of practice — and hasn’t interacted much with the press since she left the State Department in 2013. ', ' One person close to the Clintons told POLITICO that whatever she says “you guys are going to just say it raises more questions than it answers” — but the person added, “it’s something she needs to do.” ', ' On March 4, Clinton announced on Twitter that she would turn over emails to the State Department for vetting and eventual public release. “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” she tweeted at the time.
