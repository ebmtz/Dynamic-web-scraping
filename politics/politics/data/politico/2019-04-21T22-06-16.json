", " \u201cThe president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,\u201d said press secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cI would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.\u201d ", " Obama told CBS in an interview Saturday that he\u2019d learned of Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail address and server \u201cthrough news reports.\u201d However, Earnest conceded Monday that Obama knew Clinton was communicating from a private e-mail account, but was unaware of how that mail was handled or that Clinton did not have an official \u201cstate.gov\u201d account. ", " \u201cYes, the president was aware of her email address,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cHe was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act.\u201d ", " The pressure on Clinton has ratcheted up as critics, including some congressional Democrats, have called on her to publicly address the reports. ", " In December, Clinton sent 50,000 pages of emails from the private account to the State Department at its request. The agency recently turned over 900 pages of emails from Clinton\u2019s account to a House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks in 2012. ", " But critics have argued that Clinton\u2019s handling of the issue as left her and her staff totally in control of screening emails and deciding which ones are responsive to government requests. ", " Both the White House and the State Department brushed aside suggestions from that panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), that his panel may not have received all Libya-related emails. Gowdy said Clinton produced no emails from a time period when she traveled to Libya and was photographed using her BlackBerry. ", "\n  ", " ", " \u201cMaybe she was using her BlackBerry to read the news,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cYou can use your Blackberry for other things other than email, right?\u201d ", " State spokeswoman Jen Psaki took a similar tack, arguing that there was nothing suspicious about any gaps in the e-mail record. ", " \u201cI wasn\u2019t on that trip [but] I\u2019ve been on trips with the current secretary where there are communications issues, where you really don\u2019t send emails,\u201d the spokeswoman said. ", " Earnest also said the White House had allowed the State Department to manage its own response to the latest House Benghazi inquiry. ", " \u201cI would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress that [Gowdy would] be complaining about that on national television as well,\u201d the press secretary added. ", " The White House suggested Monday that concerns were misplaced about the process Clinton used to produce her emails after the State Department requested them in October. ", " But Earnest did not come down squarely for or against proposals that a neutral party verify that all work-related e-mails have been produced. Clinton allies suggested Sunday that she would be open to such a review. ", " \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anybody or seen anybody present any evidence to indicate that [Clinton\u2019s aides] didn\u2019t do what they said they did,\u201d Earnest declared. \u201cIf Secretary Clinton\u2019s team decides that they want to go to greater lengths than they already have that ultimately is a decision for them to make.\u201d ", " The fact that Obama corresponded with Clinton via a private server stoked fears that the arrangement increased the risks that either of them could have been hacked or that messages between them could have been intercepted more readily than communications between two \u201c.gov\u201d email accounts. ", " However, cybersecurity experts said that was not necessarily the case, since communications between government e-mail servers handling unclassified information are not always encrypted or directly connected. ", " \u201cThere is no top-level, [Office of Management and Budget]-driven, thou-shalt-run a common-network-with-a-common-backbone, which is what we were trying to get years ago, but could just never do it,\u201d said one expert who worked on cybersecurity issues in the George W. Bush White House and asked not to be named. E-mails \u201ccould go directly from one to another, but that depends on those two [agencies\u2019 technology leaders\u2019] getting together and engineering some kind of cross-connect.\u201d ", " The former official said that proposals over the last decade to create a government-only network went by the wayside. ", " \u201cThe grand idea of connecting the entire federal government on fiber that\u2019s only for the government \u2013 that\u2019s about as practical as building a highway system that\u2019s just for the government. Way too expensive to install, maintain and operate. So then you fall back on, okay, we\u2019ll use commercial fiber,\u201d the official said. ", " The White House declined to comment Monday on whether Obama\u2019s communication with Clinton through her private address posed any security risks or if those risks had been mitigated in some fashion. ", " \u201cOne of the security precautions we take around the president\u2019s email is we don\u2019t talk about it very [much] publicly,\u201d Earnest said, while acknowledging that policy had been breached somewhat in recent days. ", " At the State Department, Psaki said there was no indication that the content of Clinton\u2019s e-mail account was compromised, although she changed her address in 2011 after a hacker obtained it and posted it online. ", " \u201dWe don\u2019t have any reason to believe that\u201d outsiders gained access to her account,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cObviously her email wasn\u2019t hacked.\u201d ", " Clinton\u2019s expected effort to tackle questions at a press conference about her e-mail use poses risks for the former secretary, who is expected to officially announce her 2016 campaign for the White House in the next month or so. For one, she is out of practice \u2014 and hasn\u2019t interacted much with the press since she left the State Department in 2013. ", " One person close to the Clintons told POLITICO that whatever she says \u201cyou guys are going to just say it raises more questions than it answers\u201d \u2014 but the person added, \u201cit\u2019s something she needs to do.\u201d ", " On March 4, Clinton announced on Twitter that she would turn over emails to the State Department for vetting and eventual public release. \u201cI want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,\u201d she tweeted at the time. ", " Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton attended a Clinton Foundation event in New York Monday, but did not respond to reporters\u2019 questions about the emails. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this story. ", " ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " ( ", ") ", " But after vowing to review the sentences of potentially thousands of nonviolent offenders, Obama\u2019s Justice Department has yet to make much progress, as inmates anxiously await decisions. Lawyers involved in the process say they are wrestling with the huge flood of applications and struggling to determine which judge-ordered sentences may have been influenced by the crack-powder disparity, amid a three- or even four-tier review process and the ever-present fear of releasing a prisoner who might go on to commit a violent crime. ", " \u201cThe resources are woefully inadequate to address this number of applications,\u201d one lawyer involved in the process said. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous undertaking that was announced with great fanfare and promises being made without much consideration about the resources needed to get the promises fulfilled.\u201d ", " With too few government lawyers available to handle the applications, the Obama administration has turned to private lawyers and groups to prepare the petitions. Four organizations \u2014 the American Civil Liberties Union, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the American Bar Association \u2014 stepped up to form a consortium known as Clemency Project 2014 and to recruit more than 1,500 lawyers to handle the cases on a pro bono basis. ", " While any prisoner can submit a commutation request directly to the Justice Department, some lawyers claim that the close coordination between the Clemency Project and the administration suggests that prisoners going through the project will have a faster, inside track. The attorneys say comments from project organizers have reinforced that impression. ", " Administration officials insist the outside groups have no official role. All applications will be reviewed by Justice Department lawyers before recommendations are sent to the White House, they say. However, officials acknowledge that trained attorneys can help prisoners submit \u201cwell-prepared\u201d applications that will speed processing by the relatively small staff at the department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney. ", " But even with the controversial assistance from outside groups, so far only a trickle of applications has been submitted by those organizations to the Justice Department, sources said. None of those were among the eight approved by Obama last month, all of which came from thousands of petitions already on file with the Justice Department. ", " \u201cSo many people are expecting a lot,\u201d said Doug Berman, a prominent criminal-sentencing specialist and law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cI just think we\u2019re making it much too hard, too proceduralized and, until the president starts vindicating that work with lots of [positive] outcomes, I remain kind of cynical and frustrated.\u201d ", " With so many thousands of petitions pending, the tiny number of commutations announced during the Christmas season prompted a new round of skepticism about the administration\u2019s capacity to ease onerous drug sentencing ", " ", " ( ", ") ", " \u201cThis is paltry,\u201d said one lawyer familiar with the process. \u201cIt is very disappointing.\u201d ", " \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if it skyrockets to 100 before [Obama] leaves office,\u201d another added. ", " Obama\u2019s aides say it\u2019s too soon to begin to take stock of a clemency effort that was only formally announced in April, although Justice Department officials first discussed the plan publicly last January. ", " White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said the rate of commutations is likely to pick up from the eight granted this year. \u201cI would anticipate an uptick of that number,\u201d he said. ", " The White House lawyer also said the Justice Department is on the verge of working through a significant volume of cases: \u201cI\u2019m confident in the next short period of time their activity is going to ramp up.\u201d ", " However, officials declined to discuss any numerical goals for the clemency drive or to provide any details on increased staffing to accommodate the clemency effort. In addition, the administration would not commit to having all the applications processed by the time the president leaves office. ", " At his year-end news conference, Obama didn\u2019t directly reference his commutation drive, but he did signal a desire to make reducing the number of federal prisoners part of his legacy. ", " ( ", ") ", " \u201cThis is the first time in 40 years where the federal prison population and the crime rate have gone down at the same time, which indicates the degree to which it is possible for us to think smarter about who we are incarcerating, how long, how we deal with nonviolent offenders, how we deal with drug offenders,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe can do a better job and save money by initiating some of these reforms.\u201d ", " ", " ", " Obama\u2019s drive to increase the number of presidential commutations has been fueled in part by his view that recent legislation reining in overly long drug sentences unwisely neglected to reduce the sentences of prisoners already serving long terms, current and former officials say. ", " But the relatively small Office of the Pardon Attorney wasn\u2019t prepared to handle such a high volume of cases, so officials encouraged the groups forming the Clemency Project to recruit and train private attorneys to prepare applications. The organizations have instituted their own screening effort to try to determine if prisoners meet the criteria and to make sure the private lawyers spend time on meritorious cases. ", " Still, the involvement of advocacy groups is unusual and, to some, inappropriate. Some conservatives have complained that routing applications for early release through these organizations amounts to Obama abdicating responsibility for managing the clemency process. ", " \u201cThe question is, can the president outsource his clemency and pardon authority? And that\u2019s what he seems to be doing here. It\u2019s another case where the president, it appears, is abusing his authority,\u201d said Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch. \u201cThese groups don\u2019t share a concern for public safety.\u201d ", " Some liberal-leaning lawyers and clemency advocates have their own complaints. They say the private consortium has taken on an outsize, quasi-official role in the process and has an inherent conflict of interest: Project organizers want to get the strongest possible applications to the Justice Department, which may mean abandoning prisoners whose cases fall into a gray area. ", " \u201cIt bothers me that you have a group of private citizens who have an under-the-table deal with the deputy attorney general to help him do his job and the promise is, \u2018We\u2019re going to put your guys at the front of the list,\u2019\u201d one lawyer involved said. \u201cInstead of dealing with a process that\u2019s already opaque and bureaucratic and too slow, they\u2019ve added this additional layer that\u2019s even more opaque and bureaucratic and too slow.\u201d ", " A Justice Department official denied that applications by the Clemency Project will receive special treatment. ", " \u201cWe\u2019re not giving Clemency Project 2014 any special priority,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be named. \u201cThis is not to say applications coming from the Clemency Project might not possibly be of better quality,\u201d the official added, alluding to officials\u2019 hope that the project can help prisoners make their best case for early release. ", " In June, Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit demanding correspondence between the outside groups and DOJ, hoping to expose backdoor deals between the Clemency Project and the government. A judge has given the department until February to respond. ", " In addition, sources told POLITICO that questions were also raised inside the project about whether its work with the Justice Department might fall under a sunshine law governing official advisory panels, which could require the groups to open their work to the public. However, DOJ lawyers who looked into the matter concluded the law does not apply. ", " Indeed, the Justice Department denies there is any official relationship between the consortium and the department. \u201cThey are not an advisory committee at all,\u201d a Justice official said. \u201cThe Clemency Project is completely separate from us.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cDuring the decade and a half after 9/11, the FBI has changed. It is currently changing, but must urgently and boldly accelerate this change,\u201d former Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Colo.) said during a press conference at FBI Headquarters in Washington. \u201cLeadership at all levels of the FBI is not unified or consistent in driving cultural change. \u2026 Over the course of this next century, hundreds of Americans\u2019 lives will depend on it.\u201d ", " In an effort to embrace the report\u2019s themes, FBI Director James Comey appeared Wednesday morning with Roemer and the two other panel members: former Attorney General Ed Meese and Georgetown University Professor Bruce Hoffman. ", " \u201cThe progress has been extraordinary \u2026 but it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Comey declared as he welcomed the report, ordered by Congress to assess the FBI\u2019s compliance with recommendations put forward by the original 9/11 Commission. ", " Among the ", " key findings: ", " \u2014 The FBI hasn\u2019t done enough to integrate intelligence analysts into the bureau\u2019s work and still lacks a clear career path for such specialists, resulting in many of them leaving for jobs elsewhere in the government. ", " \u2014 The bureau\u2019s practice of rotating personnel through top assignments disrupts their ability to oversee needed changes and to develop expertise critical to assessing terrorism and national security threats. ", " \u2014 Some FBI agents stationed abroad, called legal attach\u00e9s, don\u2019t have the equipment needed to easily access sensitive intelligence and lack the necessary authority to marshal resources. ", " \u2014 Improving information sharing with state and local officials is a post-9/11 \u201cgood news story,\u201d but some local and state police officials still feel they\u2019re simply mined for data and rarely get back information from the feds. ", " \u2014 The FBI should get out of the business of what federal officials refer to as \u201ccountering violent extremism,\u201d because it is ill-suited to such work. ", " Comey said he agreed with many of the report\u2019s recommendations, but he challenged the proposal that the FBI leave counter-extremism work to other agencies. ", " \u201cI respectfully disagree with the review commission,\u201d the director said. \u201cIt should not be focused on messages about faith it should not be socially focused, but we have an expertise \u2026 I have these people who spend all day long thinking dark thoughts and doing research at Quantico, my Behavioral Analysis Unit. They have an incredibly important role to play in countering violent extremism.\u201d ", " Some counter-extremism experts and many in the Muslim community have argued that the FBI and federal prosecutors \u2014 who play key roles in the current effort \u2014 are not the best interlocutors because they\u2019re perceived as trying to develop informants rather than help communities head off trouble. The review panel seems to back that view, while adding that the FBI effort is too poorly funded to make a significant impact. ", " \u201cThe FBI should not be utilizing their resources in what you might call the retail business of countering propaganda,\u201d Meese said. \u201cThe bureau doesn\u2019t have the resources to get into the business of the \u2026 social and preventive aspects of it.\u201d ", " Roemer pointed to language report language, saying the FBI\u2019s \u201cfundamental law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities do not make it an appropriate vehicle\u201d for such counter-extremism efforts. ", " The panel also looked at the FBI\u2019s still-ongoing investigation of the 9/11 attacks, as well as new case theories. The commission concluded that an FBI source reported to have been a potential route to reach Osama bin Laden in the early 1990s may not have ever been in direct contact with the Al Qaeda leader, and there was no reason to think that would have produced information on an attack whose planning began in 1998 or 1999. ", " The review group also dismissed reports that a Saudi family living in Sarasota, Florida, described as having fled the U.S. soon after the 9/11 attacks, had links to the hijackers or the crime. ", " The commission did find that there is \u201congoing internal debate\u201d within the FBI about whether two of the hijackers may have had assistance as they prepared for the attack or shared plans for the crime with others. ", " \u201cThe fact that there is some debate, internal debate within the FBI between different teams, I think, we found that to be healthy \u2014 productive,\u201d Roemer said. ", " Comey said the internal discussions haven\u2019t changed the FBI\u2019s basic conclusions about 9/11, but they are evidence that agency continues to challenge its assumptions. ", " \u201cWe have no credible evidence that there were additional participants, supporters, funders that we haven\u2019t charged, we haven\u2019t identified,\u201d the director said. \u201cNo one has forgotten. We\u2019re continuing to see is this lead worth pursuing is that lead worth pursuing and arguing with each other about what could be drawn from what leads.\u201d ", " The report also looks at five major terrorism cases the FBI has handled since 9/11 and evaluates its performance. The panel said that more aggressive collection of human intelligence in Boston\u2019s Muslim community could have alerted the bureau to the fact that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev had angry outbursts that led to his banning by a local mosque. ", " Comey said he believed the FBI could try to gather information on potential crimes while still respecting religious freedom. ", " \u201cI would hope that people would tell us if they hear someone in an educational institution, a religious institution, or standing on a street corner talking about something beyond faith, about violence about engaging in some conduct that would be criminal,\u201d Comey said. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the First Amendment. I think people should worship as they choose, that people shouldn\u2019t worry about the FBI trying to figure out how they understand their faith. But when someone crosses that bright line from discussing and thinking, to talking about acting, I would like to know.\u201d ", " While Comey was in the hot seat Wednesday, answering reporter\u2019s questions about the FBI\u2019s effort to transform itself, the commission\u2019s review is more of a report card on the tenure of his predecessor, Robert Mueller. He took over the bureau a week before 9/11 and stepped down in September 2013, making way for Comey. ", " The review panel was the brainchild of former Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who pushed through legislation to force an assessment of whether the FBI had complied with the recommendations of the original 9/11 Commission. Wolf attended Wednesday\u2019s event and told reporters he believes the review panel did \u201ca good job.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Melissa Hathaway, a former White House cybersecurity official under Obama and President George W. Bush, gave a terse response: \u201cWas it encrypted? If not, then it was likely exposed.\u201d ", " It\u2019s not impossible that anyone who got into Clinton\u2019s emails would have seen Obama\u2019s email address. But George said that even if Obama\u2019s email address was exposed, it would have been highly unlikely that any outsiders would successfully send emails to the president of the United States \u2013 in part because of the monitoring, but also because Obama\u2019s email account uses \u201cwhitelisting,\u201d meaning it only accepts emails from approved addresses.

If nothing else, they could give a general sense of what he\u2019s doing or what he\u2019s interested in at a given moment.

In reality, all emails sent within the State Department are encrypted because the network itself is encrypted, a department official familiar with the State Department computer network said.

", " State spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that a special House committee\u2019s ongoing probe into the Benghazi incident was one of many factors that led the department to send a request last October that resulted in Clinton sending her former agency 55,000 pages of emails she exchanged on an unofficial account.

So that was what drove that.\u201d ", " A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Tuesday that the request for Clinton\u2019s records was \u201cindependent\u201d of and unrelated to the Benghazi probe. ", " POLITICO reported Friday that White House officials became aware in August that documents sought in the House Benghazi investigation contained Clinton\u2019s private email address. The White House flagged the issue to the State Department and Clinton aides, but the former secretary\u2019s staff decided to take no action at that point. ", " The issue remained under wraps until earlier this week when The New York Times reported that Clinton relied solely on a private email account during her service as America\u2019s top diplomat.

He believes in transparency,\u201d Jarrett said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cI know that the State Department is currently working with the National Archives to make sure that all of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails are captured.\u201d ", " Jarrett declined to say directly whether Clinton violated policy, saying such a determination was for State to make. \u201cWe established the policy here, but then we leave it up to every single agency to determine how to adhere to that policy,\u201d the Obama adviser said. ", " But a potential Republican rival to Clinton in the presidential race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seemed to suggest that Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server jeopardized sensitive State Department information. He described her use of a personal email server as \u201cbaffling.\u201d ", " \u201cFor security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is and it\u2019s a dangerous world and security would mean that you couldn\u2019t have a private server,\u201d Bush told Radio Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn\u2019t come up in Secretary Clinton\u2019s thought process.\u201d ", " Bush also had his own private web domain and e-mail account as governor. Some of those messages were requested and disclosed under state public records laws while the former governor was in office from 1999 to 2007.

But with questions swirling about whether the private email arrangement was intended to prevent access to her records and whether it complied with federal laws and regulations, Clinton called Wednesday for the State Department to make the 55,000 pages of emails public.

Those rules require deletion of classified national security information, personal information and business secrets, and allow for deletion of information about internal decision-making processes and legal advice.

", " At the briefing Friday, Hart tangled with reporters who said State Department regulations, a cable sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts in 2011 and a State Department inspector general report from 2012 all made clear that State employees should not routinely use personal email for official business.

However, the spokeswoman continued to have no response to questions about whether anyone at the department specifically authorized Clinton\u2019s use of the personal account as her sole email or whether anyone discouraged her from using such an account due to the dangers of hacking.

The spokeswoman confirmed that the department relies on Clinton\u2019s camp to decide which email were work-related, a practice Harf said is consistent with each government employee\u2019s duty to preserve official records.

It\u2019s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself.", "\u201cThe idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,\u201d Malinowski said. \u201cThis is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he said at another point in our interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before in our country.

The probe also concluded that a criminal referral CIA's acting general counsel sent to the Justice Department, complaining that Senate staffers may have broken the law by hacking into CIA computers, was based on incorrect information.", "\"The factual basis for the referral was not supported, as the author of the referral had been provided inaccurate information on which the letter was based,\" the IG's summary said, without providing further details on the reason for the misunderstanding.", "The internal watchdog report also indicated that the CIA \"information technology\" personnel involved in the incident were not forthcoming about details of the episode. \"The three IT staff members demonstrated a lack of candor about their activities during interviews by the OIG,\" said the summary (posted ", ").", "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the findings vindicated her assertions earlier this year that the actions constituted an improper intrusion by the executive branch into congressional oversight.", "\u201cThe investigation confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March \u2014 CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate Intelligence Committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers,\" Feinstein said in a statement. \"Director Brennan apologized for these actions and submitted the IG report to an accountability board.

However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) suggested that the snooping was part of an effort to thwart the Senate oversight panel.", "\"The CIA Inspector General's report describes actions by the CIA that are appalling and deeply threatening to our system of checks and balances. Congress has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight and the CIA\u2019s actions were an attempt to undermine that responsibility,\" Reid said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cWhat is even more disturbing is that the unauthorized CIA actions come in the context of the Senate's effort to complete a report of the CIA's interrogation program. The deeply troubling CIA actions show to what lengths some in the CIA are willing to stoop in order to prevent the report's release and to avoid accountability.\"", "Udall, who ", ", called for Brennan's resignation Thursday after being briefed on the IG probe. Udall also suggested that the criminal investigation be reopened by a special counsel.", "\"I have no choice but to call for the resignation of CIA Director John Brennan. The CIA unconstitutionally spied on Congress by hacking into Senate Intelligence Committee computers. This grave misconduct not only is illegal, but it violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s requirement of separation of powers. These offenses, along with other errors in judgment by some at the CIA, demonstrate a tremendous failure of leadership, and there must be consequences.\" Udall said in a statement.", "\"I also believe the administration should appoint an independent counsel to look into what I believe could be the violation of multiple provisions of the Constitution as well as federal criminal statutes and Executive Order 12333,\" the senator said earlier Thursday.", "In an interview, Heinrich said somewhat less emphatically that Brennan should step down.", "\"At this point it would probably be better for the agency, frankly, if he did step aside. I think that the level of trust between the committee and the director has hit a new low,\" Heinrich said.", "Another panel member, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), said Brennan needs to apologize publicly and provide more details on what happened.", "\"The CIA Inspector General has confirmed what Senators have been saying all along: The CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, and attempted to have Senate staff prosecuted for doing their jobs,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cDirector Brennan\u2019s claims to the contrary were simply not true.

The calls took place before McAuliffe became governor and appeared intended to benefit an electric car firm tied to the veteran Democratic operative and fundraiser, GreenTech Automotive.

I remember in particular one voice message that I played for [redacted], as it was laced with expletives at a high volume,\u201d Mayorkas said in a written statement to investigators. ", " Asked about Mayorkas\u2019 description of profanity-laden calls, Coy said Wednesday night: \u201cMy understanding is that after nearly two years trying to get just a yes or no answer on these applications, [McAuliffe] was understandably frustrated by the lack of progress.\u201d ", " The inspector general report said agency investigators spoke with numerous whistle-blowers who complained about special treatment in the so-called EB-5 visa process for applicants with political connections. The report also says investigators failed in their efforts to gather information from relevant parties outside the federal government.

Can they get an answer one way or another?\u2019 \u2026 We never asked Alejandro to do anything other than speed up the decision-making process.\u201d ", " The House Homeland Security Committee is slated Thursday morning to question Inspector General John Roth, whose report details how Mayorkas reacted to repeated phone calls and emails demanding expedited agency reviews. McAuliffe, Rodham and Rendell are not on the witness list. ", " Rendell said he made such several calls on behalf of an investment consortium called CanAm, which was involved in several projects including financing the expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia and for film production efforts. Rendell said he made some calls on the visa-program issue while governor and became a consultant for the company after leaving office \u2014 an arrangement which continues. ", " \u201cI think six months after I was out of office, Tom Rosenfeld, who\u2019s the CEO of CanAm, asked me to come on as a consultant, and I said that I would because I believe in the program and I knew the type of work that CanAm did,\u201d Rendell said. ", " Rendell also said he had not talked with McAuliffe about any of the visa-related projects but did raise the issue with several members of Congress and their staffs. ", " Rendell said he had not read the inspector general report, but he was disappointed the investigators never contacted him. \u201cThey never reached out to me in any way,\u201d the former governor said.

", " An inspector general spokesman did not respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on Rendell\u2019s claim that investigators never contacted him. ", " Rendell said the program was deeply flawed because business proposals that passed muster in one part of the country were rejected in others. Mayorkas, who was confirmed in late 2013 as deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said in his response to the IG report that some of the actions he took were aimed at improving the consistency of decisions. ", " \u201cThe program was a mess and disorganized, and one of the problems was they were applying different standards in different regions and the regions made the initial decision,\u201d Rendell said. He said that instead of routing investment money to private firms, the program should be reformed to direct to a national infrastructure bank the $500,000 foreigners need to invest for a green card. He also urged that the program be moved under the Commerce Department. ", " Rodham did not respond to emails and telephone messages left at Gulf Coast\u2019s Tysons Corner office.

Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security panel. \u201cIt seems apparent that Deputy Secretary Mayorkas gave the program attention and put reforms into place.

Some conservatives, though, are wary of meddling in state and local law enforcement. They also fear alienating police constituencies who risk their lives as public servants. ", " But between the Baltimore and Ferguson riots, the shooting of an unarmed African-American fleeing a cop during a traffic stop in South Carolina, and the retaliatory murder of several officers by citizens, many GOP lawmakers say more needs to be done than just one or two congressional hearings.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is considering a reduction in mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

In addition to the bill to start a national commission, he\u2019s sponsoring bipartisan legislation to allow well-behaved prisoners to earn time off their sentences.

Both Judiciary Committees are already discussing what needs to be done and are scheduling hearings for the next few weeks.

The group backs the idea of body cameras, it\u2019s just a question of who\u2019s going to pick up the tab. And though the Justice Department last week pledged to give $20 million to police departments to fund the pricey technology, Pasco says it\u2019s not enough. ", " \u201cCameras are coming and rightfully so \u2026 The problem is: Where is the money going to come from?\u201d he asked. ", " There are also policy questions around body cameras, including when they should be turned on: Should they be used during domestic dispute calls, for example? Would that keep victims from calling for help? And there\u2019s also an issue of public information: When can people request copies of such videos? ", " Reichert says Congress needs to help resolve these issues: \u201cFederal law enforcement has to have a role in helping and working with law enforcement to raise their standards and meet standards that are set by the federal government \u2026 We can set up a national standard we think should be met.\u201d ", " He and Scott noted that funding could be tied to certain requirements for its usage, as state and local money typically is \u2014 and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. ", " But they\u2019ve got conservative skeptics to convince. ", " Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), when asked about body cameras, said: \u201cI\u2019m in favor of it but I don\u2019t know what more we can do here other than provide funding, but we shouldn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions (R- Ala.) echoed Flake\u2019s comment: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money.\u201d ", " Federal legislation on police issues challenges conservative principles, Sen. Pat Toomey explained, just minutes after giving an impassioned speech on the floor arguing \u201cthere\u2019s no epidemic of police criminality in this country.\u201d ", " \u201cPolicing, historically, has been and belongs in the province of the states, so I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a role for Congress per se, except to engage in this discussion and make some points about the fact that the majority of the police do a great job,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said. ", " Scott, however, argues the federal government is \u201calready playing a role\u201d because localities are asking the Justice Department for help: \u201cI believe we can save some money and solve problems before they happen by deploying some resources in that direction,\u201d he said. ", " Beyond money, there\u2019s concern that federal overreach would alienate cops. ", " Former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly \u2014 who criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for leading what he called an \u201canti-police campaign\u201d \u2014 told POLITICO that Congress walks a fine line when it gets involved. ", " \u201cPolice feel they\u2019re being besieged these days, and I\u2019m not certain that Congress intervention here is needed \u2014 and I\u2019m not certain it won\u2019t reinforce the feeling of alienation,\u201d Kelly said. ", " Scott said lawmakers would tread carefully. ", " \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to suggest that somehow something insidious is everywhere in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI do think we have to be careful that we don\u2019t somehow create a negative perception that hover [over] all law enforcement officers.\u201d ", " In fact, there are several proposals circulating on the Hill that would have police advocacy groups and people like Reichert and Kelly up in arms. ", " One of them by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and firebrand Ra\u00fal Labrador (R-Idaho) would rein in a federal program that gives local law enforcers surplus military equipment, from grenade launchers to armored vehicles. Ferguson police found themselves in hot water for using such heavy-duty equipment amid protesters, but Reichert argues these can be vital in disaster situations. ", " For now, most of the work will focus on committees like Grassley\u2019s, which seem to be sticking to areas with more consensus, like mandatory minimums and body cameras. ", " During a recent speech, Grassley also floated a pitch to require states to give those charged with a misdemeanor counsel in court, and to reform a nationwide database that allows potential employers to find out if applicants were ever arrested \u2014 and use it against them even if they were released without charges. ", " There\u2019s also staff-level talk about whether the standard for a Justice Department investigation into a civil rights case should be lowered, allowing the attorney general to step in more often. In Grassley\u2019s home state of Iowa, for example, a man stopped for alleged drunk boating drowned while cuffed in police custody. But when Grassley asked the attorney general\u2019s office to look into the matter, he was told don\u2019t get your hopes up: It\u2019s nearly impossible to start a civil rights case. ", " As they move forward, expect Republicans to frame the issue carefully. ", " \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to tell cities how to run their police departments,\u201d Grassley said. ", " As long as they do something, proponents are fine with that back and forth: \u201cIt reached that level [that Congress needs to get involved] a while ago,\u201d Reichert said. Until something is done, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see more and more \u2026 police officers targeted.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " In its 2014 budget request, made before the protests in Ferguson, Mo., the Justice Department said it was already flooded with requests for the lawyers to conduct \u201cpattern or practice\u201d investigations into police units suspected of widespread abuse. \u201cOn at least a weekly basis, the Division is contacted by community groups, public officials or, in some cases, police leaders asking SPL to open a pattern or practice investigation. Preliminary reviews of these matters have identified very serious concerns that would benefit from the Division\u2019s intervention,\u201d the agency said. ", " Now, with intense media and political focus on policing issues, the division is ill-equipped to serve as the go-to response for scandal-hit law enforcement departments across the country. ", " \u201cThe president really needs to address the resource issue,\u201d said William Yeomans, a former assistant attorney general who now teaches at American University Law School, who praised the mayor\u2019s decision. ", " and ", " He pointed out that the investigation into the 53-officer Ferguson Police Department, released in March, took significant attention from dozens of Justice Department officials. Baltimore, for comparison, has approximately 3,000 officers. ", " The section, which began its police oversight in 1994, is tasked with more than just pattern-or-practice investigations of police forces. It also probes civil rights abuses in the nation\u2019s thousands of jails and prisons, public reproductive health-care clinics, and in other public institutions. The DOJ has said attorneys in the section only spend a third of their time on police misconduct. ", " Since taking office, the Obama administration has opened 21 investigations into police departments of various sizes \u2014 from Los Angeles and New Orleans to Missoula, Montana, and Beacon, New York. ", " Such probes can result in legally binding agreements or lawsuits that force reforms in department policy. In its first five years, the Obama-era section secured double the number of agreements of the last five years of the Bush administration. ", " But the investigations are incredibly labor-intensive, demanding numerous visits to the city and the attention of large numbers of employees. The Justice Department\u2019s 2014 budget request said that each investigation requires, on average, 1,900 hours of attorney time in its first year, a number that would likely increase in a large city such as Baltimore. ", " Also, the section\u2019s lawyers do not have subpoena power, which can make it challenging to get all the documents they need. ", " The DOJ, perhaps recognizing how significant a commitment an investigation in Baltimore would be, didn\u2019t immediately agree to launch a pattern-and-practice investigation. A separate part of the Civil Rights Division, focused on criminal investigations, has already launched a more narrow probe into the circumstances around Gray\u2019s death, and on Thursday the Maryland delegation of lawmakers sent a letter asking for the pattern-or-practice investigation. ", " Rawlings-Blake\u2019s move to call for an investigation into patterns of abuse in her city, though not entirely unprecedented, has until now been quite uncommon. One notable other example is Charles Ramsey, who called for the DOJ to investigate the police forces of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., when he led those departments. ", " But many experts believe that with so many cities plagued by unrest, other mayors and top police officials could follow suit, stretching the section even thinner. ", " Samuel Walker, a criminologist and the author of \u201cPresidents and Civil Liberties from Wilson to Obama,\u201d said that Obama should seek to expand the office\u2019s size and powers. ", " \u201cThere are many police departments where there are patterns of abuses of citizens\u2019 rights in violation of the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very valuable for the Special Litigation Section to be expanded and for it to be granted subpoena power.\u201d ", " Whether there is political will for such an expansion is unclear. ", " For the administration to significantly ramp up the section\u2019s operations, it would need a Republican Congress to endow it with a larger budget and further powers. ", " Such a change doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon. Prominent Republicans cautioned the Justice Department against launching an investigation immediately, saying that granting such large-scale probes to mayors possibly seeking political cover would begin a dangerous precedent. ", " Even Obama has acknowledged that the federal government has a limited role. ", " \u201cThe challenge for us as the federal government is that we don\u2019t run these police forces,\u201d he said at an April 28 press conference following the Baltimore riots. \u201cI can\u2019t federalize every police force in the country and force them to retrain.\u201d ", " Bradley Schlozman, who ran the Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush, called Mayor Rawlings-Blake\u2019s move a \u201csurrender\u201d to the federal government. Though he declined to say whether or not an investigation in Baltimore was warranted without viewing the facts on the ground, he warned that \u201cyou can\u2019t necessarily extrapolate a pattern or practice of misconduct from isolated incidents,\u201d even if they result in widespread protests. ", " \u201cIf you simply indulge a request without ensuring that the proper legal standards have been satisfied, then the department has been politicized,\u201d said Schlozman. He advised that police forces turn first to non-profits and other consultants and view the Department of Justice as a last resort. ", " Robert Driscoll, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the second Bush administration, also cautioned against mixing politics and policing. ", " \u201cThey should make clear if they\u2019re doing it that they\u2019re doing it based on the facts and not because the mayor requested it,\u201d he said, adding that \u201clocal police forces resent consent decrees\u201d since unions and police leadership typically want to organize reforms themselves without federal mandate. ", " Driscoll said that the special litigation section currently has the capacity to conduct targeted investigations of \u201cseveral large places at once.\u201d He said 30 to 40 attorneys should be sufficient, so long as the investigations focus on specific practices, like use of K-9s or so-called rough-rides, that are allegedly being abused and don\u2019t pour through every aspect of a police force. ", " The Justice Department has few other tools besides the Special Litigation Section\u2019s investigations to pursue systemic reforms in police departments. ", " In 2011, the Obama administration added a new program in the Community Oriented Policing Services office for law enforcement agencies actively seeking reform. But the program has no legally-binding authority and relies on the consent of local leaders who may be reluctant to agree to major overhauls that could include their firing. ", " To date it has only launched efforts in six cities, one of which was Baltimore last year. ", " And Yeomans said reviews by the COPS office are no substitute for the patterns or practice investigations, which carry real legal consequences. ", " \u201cThis is the best stick that the Department of Justice has,\u201d Yeomans said. \u201dWithout an effective stick, all of the carrots \u2014 federal government collaborative programs [for police reform] \u2014 will be less effective.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Instead, she has sent some of her top deputies: Vanita Gupta, the head of the department\u2019s civil rights division, and Ron Davis, the director of community oriented policing services at DOJ; and Grande Lum, the head of the department\u2019s Community Relations Services office. ", " The violence in Baltimore quickly threw Lynch into the first crisis of her term as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official as she seeks to restore order in Baltimore and probe the circumstances surrounding Gray\u2019s death earlier this month. The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the matter. ", " Even as she was being sworn in as attorney general on Monday, it was clear the issue of police-community relations would become one of her key markers during her tenure as the attorney general. Lynch, the first female African-American attorney general, appeared to make a nod to that, saying at her swearing-in ceremony: \u201cWe can restore trust and faith both in our laws and in those of us who enforce them.\u201d ", " Over the past year, there have been a series of fatal clashes between police officers and unarmed black men that have brought to the surface deep mistrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. ", " But she is no stranger to the issue of police confrontations and accusations of brutality. One of the key cases that the veteran lawyer helped prosecute was that of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1999, where Lynch was on a legal team that secured a guilty plea from a New York police officer for sodomizing Louima with a broomstick. ", " More recently as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch\u2019s office was heading up the investigation into the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died after being placed in a chokehold by New York police. The Justice Department is still working on that probe, and New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton ", " earlier this week that Lynch asked him to hold off on the NYPD\u2019s own investigation into the Garner case until the Justice probe is finished. ", " \u201cShe understands community concerns,\u201d said Janice Fedarcyk, a former assistant director for the FBI in New York, where she worked with Lynch. The now-attorney general served as the top federal prosecutor there for two separate terms. Fedarcyk added: \u201cShe understands how to reach into those diverse communities and start a dialogue, as much as she understands how tough a law enforcement job is.\u201d ", " Lynch quickly got to work Monday, briefing President Barack Obama on the situation in Baltimore less than six hours after she was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden at Justice Department headquarters. She was confirmed by the Senate last week on a 56-43 vote, more than five months after she was nominated by Obama in November. ", " On Tuesday, she directed the Justice Department\u2019s outreach to key leaders and groups in Baltimore, as well as telling Gupta and Davis to contact families for both Gray and the Baltimore police officers injured in the demonstrations on Monday. ", " The Justice officials sent to Baltimore met with Gray\u2019s family to express their condolences, according to a readout from the department Tuesday night. And during their meeting with a Baltimore police officer who is still hospitalized after Monday\u2019s violent protests, the Justice officials reiterated that safety of officers are a priority, according to the readout. ", " Though Lynch said contact with Gray\u2019s family was essential, she also added, according to a Justice Department official: \u201cWhen officers get injured in senseless violence, they become victims as well.\u201d ", " Lynch held a conference call Tuesday with key members of the Maryland delegation on the current DOJ investigations into the Baltimore police and other assistance that the department could give. She also spoke with Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, according to a Justice Department official. ", " She \u201cassured us that the DOJ investigations of the Baltimore City Police Department are ongoing and have her highest priority and attention,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said Tuesday night. \u201cI feel confident that the DOJ will conduct thorough investigations and that the findings will help provide answers to the many questions surrounding the death of Freddie Gray and the policies and practices of the Baltimore City Police Department.\u201d ", " Those who have worked with Lynch closely in years past describe a lawyer who keeps a steady hand, even in the throes of crisis. ", " \u201cWhen things get hot, she gets cool and focused,\u201d said David Barlow, a former U.S. attorney from Utah who served with Lynch on a committee of U.S. attorneys that provide advice to the attorney general. He, like Fedarcyk, testified on Lynch\u2019s behalf at her confirmation hearings before the Senate in January. \u201cShe is dispassionate, cool, and steady, rather than visceral.\u201d ", " And even some of her critics had no qualms with how Lynch has handled the crisis in Baltimore so far. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s more, I think, of a local governance and state government issue in terms of the National Guard, in terms of the police,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who voted against Lynch last week. \u201cBut looks to me like she\u2019s appropriately sent folks from the civil rights division and others down there to monitor the situation.

At the end of the day, if a program is unable to meet the gainful employment standard after being given every opportunity to do so \u2026 that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d ", " Industry enrollments are now on the downswing, clocking a 20 percent drop since 2010. Many major providers\u2019 stock prices have fallen dramatically in the same period: ITT, Corinthian and EDMC saw declines of 95 percent, while Strayer Education and Apollo dropped 65 percent. Apollo\u2019s University of Phoenix has closed 115 campuses and halved its enrollment since initiating a restructuring in 2011 \u2014 \u201cto re-engineer our business processes and educational delivery systems to students.\u201d ", " Apollo ", " Tuesday that it will lay off 600 employees, close more campuses and \u2014 in a major shift \u2014 add new admissions criteria, which could further cut declining enrollments while simultaneously increasing student retention and graduation rates.

", " A for-profit model that aims to maximize enrollment \u2014 and thus, profit \u2014 without regard to innovation or program quality may not be long for this world, said Derrick Anderson, an assistant public policy professor at Arizona State University. ", " \u201cThere are many different for-profit models, and the for-profit paradigm is not inherently bad when applied to higher education,\u201d Anderson said. For instance, a college like Flatiron School in New York City \u2014 whose simple financial model is built around student job placement \u2014 can and will continue to do just fine. ", " \u201cHowever,\u201d Anderson said, \u201cit seems increasingly the case that some of those models cannot work.\u201d ", " All the action hasn\u2019t quieted for-profit critics in and outside of Congress, who think the Education Department isn\u2019t doing enough to punish colleges or help students they believe have been left with huge debt and degrees deemed worthless in some cases. ", " \u201cThe continued upheaval in the wake of Corinthian\u2019s collapse is a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that profits off students while sticking them with a worthless degree and insurmountable debt,\u201d Durbin said. The Illinois Democrat called Corinthian\u2019s dismantling \u201cthe canary in the coal mine for the for-profit college industry.\u201d ", " Even while scrutinizing the department\u2019s handling of Corinthian \u2014 most recently, regarding its ", " for closed-school student loan discharges \u2014 critics agree the country is undoubtedly better off with Corinthian out of the picture. ", " When a college closing means fewer students wind up in hopeless situations, it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely a positive thing,\u201d said Rory O\u2019Sullivan, deputy director of Young Invincibles. ", " California Attorney General Kamala Harris sued Corinthian Colleges, alleging it misrepresented job placement rates and school programs to lure low-income state residents.(AP Photo) ", "\n  ", " ", " O\u2019Sullivan sat on the department\u2019s negotiated rulemaking ", ", which set out to develop the gainful employment regulation in 2013-14. The group failed to reach consensus on regulatory language, so the department wrote the rule itself, leaving neither colleges nor advocates like O\u2019Sullivan entirely satisfied. ", " Yet between the regulations, the publicity and the action by agencies from various federal agencies, \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a lot of progress that the administration could take some credit for,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. ", " \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that this is hard work, that it\u2019s detailed work, and that the stakes are high,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe want to get it right, but we can always learn more. And I think we\u2019ve learned a lot through the Corinthian situation.\u201d ", " There may well be more disruption to come. ", " This spring has certainly been tough on the industry: DeVry had already said it would close more than a dozen campuses. Corinthian\u2019s announcement two months ago that its last 28 campuses would never again open their doors prompted several lawmakers to demand closed-school discharges for those students. And then Career Education Corp. and EDMC dropped their respective bombs: The former would phase out 14 campuses and sell another three, and the latter would eventually wind down 15 of its 52 Art Institute locations. ", " Further, EDMC ", " last week that it will cut 300 jobs. Enrollment at the company\u2019s four for-profit brands has dropped nearly 30 percent since 2010, reports indicate. ", " Late last year, Career Education also said it would sell its 16-campus Le Cordon Bleu culinary school chain. ", " The gainful employment rule is only part of the picture. Factors beyond the control of the administration \u2014 and the colleges themselves \u2014 are at play, too. ", " \u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing right now is a market correction,\u201d said Ben Miller, senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the flexibility of the for-profit sector \u2014 that\u2019s always talked about as a feature for growth \u2014 operating in reverse.\u201d ", " That\u2019s through no fault of their own, many colleges would argue. ITT recently ", " its naysayers in Congress and the administration of \u201cactions built on misinformation, false facts and allegations only.\u201d ", " At his first day as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress last Wednesday, former CFPB student loan ombudsman Rohit Chopra ", " he\u2019s targeting ITT over consumer protection concerns. ITT spokeswoman Nicole Elam ", " the move suggests \u201ca personal bias against our institutions and an unwillingness to allow for due process to work, the cornerstone of the U.S. legal system.\u201d Such transitions from the government to private sectors \u201craise serious concerns involving government ethics rules and the appearance of sharp practice,\u201d she added. ", " Facing a ", " of challenges including a one-day hold on federal financial aid, ITT closed four campuses last year. ", " The potential for closures has been a key point in for-profits\u2019 argument against the gainful employment rule since its development. ", " \u201cBecause of gainful, you\u2019re seeing fewer options in higher education for these types of [career and technical] programs,\u201d said Noah Black, a spokesman at the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, whose ", " failed to kill the administration\u2019s rule. APSCU argues the regulations unfairly target the \u201cnew traditional\u201d students who are older, borrow more, work more and gravitate toward for-profits. ", " \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more of this over the next five years,\u201d Black said. ", " Career Education Corp. directly called out the gainful employment rule when it announced it would drop some campuses. ", " \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that a more difficult higher education marketplace and challenging regulatory environment have handicapped our ability to turn these institutions around quickly and operate these programs effectively in the long-term,\u201d Mark Spencer, director of corporate communications, said in a statement. ", " Such actions seemed to indicate that for-profits were fully expecting gainful employment to come to bear, said Kevin Kinser, an associate professor of education at the State University of New York \u2014 despite APSCU\u2019s success in getting a judge to throw out the first rule in 2012. The types of programs being eliminated \u2014 for example, at EDMC\u2019s Art Institutes \u2014 are ones that won\u2019t fare as well under the rule\u2019s debt-to-income metric. ", " And not all of the floundering colleges are run by gigantic companies facing an array of charges, like Corinthian. Smaller, regional colleges are shrinking, too \u2014 schools like Eastern Hills Academy of Hair Design and Tulare Beauty College, both of which closed campuses this year. ", " \u201cYou\u2019re erasing a decade of gains here,\u201d Kinser said. ", " Yet even with last week\u2019s court ruling, the rule\u2019s not totally in the clear. Sen.

A Slate report on the contacts based on research by computer scientists caused an online sensation just days before the election, until The New York Times ", " that the FBI had concluded there could be what the paper called an \u201cinnocuous explanation\u201d for the activity, like a marketing email or spam.", "Many independent cybersecurity researchers and experts, many of whom worked at senior levels in the Pentagon, White House and intelligence community, have continued to insist that the timing and frequency of the server activity was not consistent with an automated process. \u201cThe timing of the communication was not random, and it wasn\u2019t regular-periodic,\u201d one researcher ", " the New Yorker in October. \u201cIt was a better match for human activity.\u201d", "Innocuous or not, the server activity is not addressed in the Mueller report at all. The only discussion of Alfa Bank comes within the context of efforts by its CEO, Petr Aven, to connect with the Trump transition team in December 2016. Those efforts apparently were unsuccessful, according to Mueller, which may have led the special counsel\u2019s office to dismiss the computer server activity as inconsequential. But there\u2019s still no conclusive explanation for the pinging or why the Trump domain that Alfa was contacting abruptly disappeared two days after The New York Times", "notified Alfa\u2019s representatives in Washington of the server activity.

But the company didn\u2019t appear once in the report, despite indications that Mueller had questioned and subpoenaed former employees.", "The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in summer 2016, and the company played a key role in trying to sway voters using pilfered Facebook data.", "Beginning in 2014, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American who worked at the University of Cambridge, helped the firm harvest the raw data of up to 87 million Facebook profiles, which the company then used to microtarget political ads. There\u2019s a WikiLeaks connection, too: Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s CEO, has acknowledged reaching out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in summer 2016 to offer help organizing any Hillary Clinton-related emails WikiLeaks planned to release.", "Mueller subpoenaed Brittany Kaiser, the former business development director for the firm, earlier this year. She told The Guardian that she was fully cooperating. Sam Patten, a Washington-based operative who began cooperating with Mueller\u2019s probe last year after pleading guilty to an unrelated charge, worked at the Oregon office of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL Group, in run-up to the 2014 midterm elections. And Mueller quizzed several digital experts who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign about the big-data firm, according to ABC. ", "Like the server activity, however, Cambridge Analytica is not mentioned at all in Mueller\u2019s report. Therefore, it is still unclear what, if anything, the company knew about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans or whether its microtargeting efforts were coordinated with the Russian\u2019s information warfare campaign.

The investigators continued asking witnesses about the campaign\u2019s ties to the NRA as recently as December, according to CNN.", "And July\u2019s indictment of Mariia Butina, a Russian national who sought to infiltrate both the Trump campaign and the NRA before the election, also raised questions about the group\u2019s status as a potential intermediary between Trump and the Russians. Butina was charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the Justice Department.", "Butina was the first person to ask Trump in public about his position on Russian sanctions \u2014 during a 2015 event in Las Vegas \u2014 and tried to broker a meeting between Trump and her Russian handler, Alexander Torshin, at an NRA convention in May 2016.", "McClatchy later reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators were investigating whether Torshin laundered money from Russia through the NRA to help fund Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 the NRA spent $30 million to support Trump in 2016, triple what it spent supporting Mitt Romney in 2012.", "Despite the investigators\u2019 interest, however, the gun rights group was not mentioned a single time in Mueller\u2019s report.

Between March and April 2016, the report said, \u201cthe GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks\u201d and disseminated them both through GRU agents posing as independent hackers \u2014 including Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks \u2014 and WikiLeaks.", "According to Mueller's report, the GRU used those fake online personas to shuttle some of its stolen cache to WikiLeaks. Through DCLeaks, the GRU initiated a conversation with WikiLeaks about transferring stolen documents on June 16, 2016. Eight days later, WikiLeaks reached out to Guccifer 2.0 via Twitter and asked for \u201cany new material.\u201d", "Mueller noted that Assange and WikiLeaks tried to obscure the source of the hacked materials by claiming in public statements that the DNC hack was an \"inside job\" carried out by Seth Rich, a murdered committee staffer, rather than Russia.", "But the special counsel\u2019s office either wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t explain what WikiLeaks knew about the true identity of the hackers.", "\u201cBoth the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the Office's ability to collect all of the communications between them,\u201d the report said, pointing to their use of encryption.", "That information could be relevant to determining whether WikiLeaks acted in a journalistic capacity, as Assange has maintained, or as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service\u201d abetted by Russia, as then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo claimed in April 2017.", "Assange was arrested in London earlier this month after Ecuador withdrew his asylum.

His report states that Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze texted then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen on Oct. 30, 2016 and said: \"Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there\u2019s anything else.

But for whatever reason, he didn\u2019t tell that to Cohen, according to the report. Mueller does not draw a conclusion one way or the other.
