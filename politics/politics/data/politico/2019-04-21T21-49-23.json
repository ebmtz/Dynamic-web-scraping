Finally, a brown -haired student, Eric, slouched and raccoon-eyed, bolts upright: \u201cOh my God,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI have a shell.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in!\u201d shouts his blonde-haired compatriot, rubbing his hands. The furious typing resumes. ", "Halderman explained that the student had used a technique called Shell Injection Vulnerability. He found a single, wayward quotation mark in the code, a crack in the floorboard through which they drove a tractor -trailer of attack commands. ", "Halderman\u2019s attack is now well-known in the world of elections administration; the Virginia election official I spoke with seemed doubtful that Internet voting could ever take off, citing the conventional view that the risks are too great. \u201cWhether or not Internet voting happens, and whether we will introduce these new risks\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d ", "Internet voting companies have the same incentives as voting tech conglomerates to convince the public they\u2019re worth their mettle; as in the case of HAVA, there would likely be an enormous windfall. In 2004, Michigan deployed Internet voting in its Democratic primary. In 2009, West Virginia greenlighted a pilot to allow overseas military vote online. This year, the entire 2016 Utah primary was conducted online, and an initiative in California to introduce online voting nearly made it onto the state ballot. ", "Halderman finds it hard to believe he now has to make the same argument about the risk of hacking all over again. \u201cIt\u2019s not something only comic book villains can do,\u201d he explains. \u201cThese are students right out of college that are doing this.\u201d ", " ", " *** ", " ", "is an invention in American politics, and a recent one. The first time a secret ballot was widely deployed was the presidential election of 1896\u2014also the first election in which someone was not murdered on Election Day, according to Harvard professor Jill Lepore. The two are not a coincidence: Since the earliest days of the republic, voting was almost entirely a collectivist act. Citizens voted with their feet\u2014standing on one side of a crowd or another, caucus-style\u2014a setup which manipulative party bosses plainly preferred. ", "The cadre of computer programmers who made their home on the Princeton campus are now in a race, of sorts\u2014against voting machine companies, against Internet voting firms\u2014to invent the future of secure voting. And the most interesting ideas look to this 19 th century arrangement not with revulsion, but intrigue. It turns out that, from the perspective of mathematical systems confirmation, Boss Tweed may have had a few things right. ", "After his testimony in Houston urging the council not to adopt the machines, Wallach, the Rice professor, spent the proceeding years working on research showing vulnerabilities on digital touch screens, and testifying in state legislatures across the country. But Wallach\u2019s focus has shifted from diagnosis to cure, and he\u2019s now working with Travis County, where Austin is located, as a leading researcher on the newest innovation in voting technology: Cryptographic voting. ", "Wallach walks backward through the concept by offering a thought experiment. The most unimpeachable election technique would be to count the votes on an enormous corkboard; every voter would pin his or her vote, and the public would count the results together. Everyone would see the votes, and everyone would agree on the result. Besides the problem of privacy and intimidation (and, ostensibly, killings on Election Day), such a system is ungainly\u2014it\u2019s a lot of corkboard. But encrypting the vote would allow a public accounting while keeping the actual votes private: voters would make their selection on a digital processing machine; they\u2019d then receive an encrypted receipt, a random assortment of numbers and letters. Their vote would then be uploaded to a public bulletin board online; any voter could compare their encrypted vote to see if it matched the numbers and letters online. The vote itself would be scrambled and completely secret; a complex function, known as homomorphic cryptography, would count the votes without unencrypting the source. ", "\u201cCrypto,\u201d as it\u2019s known in the field, would secure our elections something close to permanently. But it would change fundamentally the way we vote. It would make the act of gawking at random source code a civic requirement. And it would abolish the concept of a countable \u201cballot,\u201d forcing us to trust that incomprehensible code is the equivalent of a ballot. Cryptographic voting is still years away from ready. But it also begs the question of whether the concept has simply transferred a technocratic leap of faith from one part of the electronic system to another one. It seemed difficult to believe, after a bruising decade of invisible votes and disappearing ballots, that voters would put their faith in something so abstract. After four explanations from Wallach, I was still dumbfounded. ", "Wallach and other researchers point to another safeguard that is closer to application-ready, a new method of auditing. The technique is called Risk Limited Auditing, statistical innovation worked out by Philip Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The auditing techniques of most states aren\u2019t sophisticated enough to detect a subtle attack\u2014every 100 th vote switched from Trump to Hillary Clinton, for instance. \u201cThe whole point of a Risk Limiting Audit is not to find the tally down to the last digit,\u201d explains Wallach. \u201cThe problem you\u2019re trying to figure out is if the error rate is big enough that I could change who won.\u201d RLA would enhance the auditing prospects of most states, 25 of which have inadequate auditing procedures, according to Verified Voting. Colorado is expected to implement RLA next year. ", "But there may be a simpler hack at hand. Appel, the Princeton cybersecurity expert\u2014master of numbers, merry prankster of machines\u2014proposes a radical idea to this 15-year nightmare: What if we took a page from the town criers of two centuries ago, and simply read the precinct results out loud? ", "\u201cThere\u2019s a very simple and old-fashioned recipe that we use in our American democracy,\u201d Appel says. \u201cThe vote totals in each polling place are announced at the time the polls closed, in the polling place, to all observers\u2014the poll workers, the party challengers, any citizen that\u2019s observing the closing of the polls.\u201d He goes on to describe how the totals in that precinct would be written on a piece of paper\u2014pencils do just fine\u2014then signed by the poll workers who have been operating that polling site. ", "\u201cAny citizen can independently add up the precinct -by - precinct totals,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a very important check. It\u2019s a way that with our precinct-based polling systems, we can have some assurance that hacked computers could not undetectably change the results of our election.\u201d ", "There could be a greater lesson in Appel\u2019s point. Technology didn\u2019t create the problem. Perhaps technology is intrinsic to the problem\u2014our lack of trust that has metastasized in a surveillance culture was bound to aggrandize the problems of voting, the most trusting civic act we know. It seems unlikely to expect a singular cure to the American presidential election, not because of the incomprehensibility of cryptography or the untrustworthiness of tech companies, but because there is no such thing as the singular election: 8,000 jurisdictions in a leaky mess of federalism and poorly spent dollars. The neat results and cable announcements on election night represent an optical illusion, like a series of ones and zeroes, whizzing beyond our apprehension. ", "Wallach\u2019s encomium on cryptography reminded me of another tech item: The concept of shared fate, sometimes referenced in drone research. Researchers have long suggested our planes and trains could be made safer were they run by highly precise robots, or drone pilots\u2014cool customers who don\u2019t have to save a burning plane while worrying about turbulence and screaming passengers. It may be one of the most enduring examples of psychology trumping technocracy: Even though systems would run better\u2014even save lives\u2014everyone knows this arrangement is unworkable. Humans require knowing that there\u2019s someone, like us, in the cockpit. We need to know we\u2019ll endure a shared fate. ", "If this century has shifted our trust from away from our neighbors toward machines, it might be time to switch back again. Eight countries in Europe that once flirted with digital voting have seen six go back to paper; Britain counted its Brexit votes by hand. Even if the vote were never hacked\u2014and it is an exceedingly implausible event\u2014the remotest possibility is an albatross on democracy and a boon for mischief-makers, and not just the cyber attackers. Trump\u2019s most recent jujitsu\u2014pointing out that by virtue of the fact that the election is hackable, it could be rigged against him\u2014illustrates this risk. Technology has amplified not only the threat of hacking, but the threat of a hack. ", "The Princeton alums can warn us\u2014but they can\u2019t protect us. \u201cWe are in a collision -course between the technology we use in election administration and the growing reality of politically motivated, state level cyber attacks,\u201d Halderman tells me, arm propped on his red office chair, sunlight pouring through his westward window. \u201cWe sit around all day and write research papers.

It allowed him to focus on what fueled him without being forced to discuss publicly significant details about his personal life \u2014 like his meager finances, his bare-bones living arrangement, and the fact that the mother of his one biological child is not his ex-wife. That\u2019s a surprise to some who have known him for decades.

Barnett called Mott \u201ca pretty quiet, private person.\u201d Sanders rented a small brick duplex at 295 1/2 Maple Street that was filled with not much furniture and not much food in the fridge but stacks of checked-out library books and scribbled-on legal pads.

The recent uncovering of something he wrote in an issue from February 1972 created a burst of news coverage. It was a jumbled rant about gender roles that mentioned masturbation and rape, but even in Sanders\u2019 commentary on the sexes he reverted to his central theme of injustice: \u201cSlavishness on one hand breeds pigness on the other hand.

He needed to try to make a better, more stable living, but didn\u2019t want to give up a platform from which he could preach.

As a whole, they were scant, but Sanders had done better in Burlington than anywhere else \u2014 and especially in the city\u2019s poorest wards. Sanders decided to run for mayor \u2014 and then, by 10 votes, he won. It was March of 1981. It was a big story. The irritant activist was an elected official, now making $33,800 a year, more than he ever had. Reporters started showing up in Vermont. ", " Clippings from news coverage of Sanders in the 1970s.

He was, as Rolling Stone declared, the \u201cred mayor in the Green Mountains.\u201d ", " Sanders, who long had fashioned himself as something of a media critic, poked fun at the facile storyline.

", " As a reporter named Louis Berney wrote in the Vanguard after Sanders\u2019 win, \u201chis rumpled appearance and harried style, his charismatic oratory and fiery invectives against corporate America \u2026 are familiar to the Vermont electorate and have become woven into the state\u2019s political folklore. Yet as Sanders prepares to take over the helm of Vermont\u2019s largest city, little is known about the man.\u201d ", " Berney\u2019s article in the Vanguard, headlined Sanders on Sanders: Meet the Mayor, included a mention of Sanders\u2019 normally off-limits private life \u2014 but what Berney wrote was incorrect: ", " Sanders in 1981 after a thin victory in the Burlington mayoral race. | Rob Swanson ", " He and his wife had a son, Levi. ", " In an email this week from China, where he teaches journalism, Berney wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t remember the particulars of the interview. And I couldn\u2019t swear that he actually said, \u2018My wife and I had a son.\u2019 It\u2019s possible that he said it in a way that is similar to what you quote from his resume. I might have erred in putting one and one together and coming up with two and a half. I do know that neither Bernie nor anyone else attempted to correct the error.\u201d ", " \u201cHe was very, very guarded about that,\u201d Alan Abbey, who covered Sanders and City Hall at the time for the Burlington Free Press, told me in a Skype conversation from Israel, where he now lives. \u201cI know we didn\u2019t probe that, for sure. I would say I didn\u2019t push enough, and I certainly wasn\u2019t pushed by my newspaper. We knew he was divorced. We knew he had a kid. I think we may have left it at that.\u201d ", " Sanders\u2019 biggest obstacle in his initial term as mayor was an obdurate City Council, suspicious of the socialist Sanders\u2019 aims, not a prying press corps. As mayor, though, Sanders got more and more people to vote \u2014 he later called that increased political engagement his \u201cproudest accomplishment\u201d \u2014 and he got more and more people to vote for him. In \u201981, he got barely more than 50 percent; by \u201987, it was 56. U.S. News & World Report called him one of the nation\u2019s best 20 mayors. ", " He decided to leave office in \u201989. The next year, he was elected to Congress, and he was reelected in \u201992, and again in \u201994. In '96, he faced a Republican named Susan Sweetser. And she paid an investigator to look into his background. ", " Cathy Riggs called his ex-wife. ", " Sanders called a news conference. ", " \u201cThis is the kind of activity which makes politics so distasteful to people in the country and I think encourages people not to participate in the political process, not to vote, and certainly not to run for public office,\u201d Sanders said. ", " His second wife, Jane Sanders, whom he married in 1988 \u2013 and to whom he is still married \u2013 also talked. \u201cWe are who we say we are,\u201d she said. ", " Riggs said she was just doing her job and that she had done nothing illegal. ", " Sanders in his Outsider book devoted nearly three pages to the episode. ", " \u201cShe contacted my ex-wife, Deborah Messing, from whom I\u2019ve been divorced for over 25 years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDeborah contacted her friend and neighbor, Anthony Pollina, who used to work with me, and Anthony contacted me. Deborah and I then talked. ", " \u201cClearly, Riggs was hoping to find a disgruntled ex-wife who would spill the beans on her former husband. But that was not going to happen with Deborah, who has been remarried for over 20 years. While we don\u2019t see each other very often, we remain good friends, so Deborah told Riggs where to get off. Her sentiments were reflected all over Vermont.\u201d ", " Sanders cited a chunk of an article from the Associated Press written by Christopher Graff, who at the time was the AP\u2019s longtime Montpelier bureau chief (and whose son, Garrett Graff, is the editor of ", "). ", " \u201cWhat may be considered fair and proper in other states leaves Vermonters apoplectic,\u201d Graff had written. \u201cIt is against this background that Vermonters viewed Susan Sweetser\u2019s hiring of a private eye to probe Sanders\u2019 background. Such a hiring would not even gain a passing mention in most states these days. It is accepted practice.\u201d ", " Sweetser, seeing that this attempt at a thorough vetting of Sanders had backfired, denounced the woman her campaign had hired. \u201cI want to make it clear to the people of Vermont that Cathy Riggs went too far,\u201d she said. Too late. Sanders trounced Sweetser, winning the election by more than 20 percentage points. ", " Sanders went on to win another election in 1998, and another in 2000, and another in 2002, and another in 2004, and was elected to the Senate in 2006. In 2012, 40 years after he got 2.2 percent of the vote in his first bid for the Senate, he was reelected to that seat with 71 percent. \u201cHe\u2019s very trustworthy,\u201d said Donna Kaplan, who gave him $20 when he was running for governor in 1976. \u201cWhat Bernie is saying is the truth,\u201d said Bob McKee, who gave him $100 during that campaign. \u201cAnd he\u2019s never wavered,\u201d said Betty Clark, a friend from his time with Liberty Union.

", " On a background call with reporters, an official repeatedly said the attack \u201cclearly crossed a threshold\u201d that hadn\u2019t been seen before. ", " \u201cThis is really an example of where you\u2019ve had a country really cross a threshold in terms of its attack due to its destructive and coercive nature,\u201d the official said. ", " The sanctions prohibit the people and organizations named from any access to the U.S. financial system, and forbids any banks or other financial institutions that do business with the U.S. system from doing business with the sanctioned entities. ", " The order signed by the president also bars foreign individuals found to be affiliated with the North Korean government from entering the U.S. ", " In a statement, press secretary Josh Earnest called the actions the \u201cfirst aspect\u201d of the \u201cproportionate response\u201d the U.S. has promised since naming North Korea as responsible for the Thanksgiving attack just before Christmas. ", " \u201cWe take seriously North Korea\u2019s attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression,\u201d Earnest said. ", " On the background call, officials were asked whether calling Friday\u2019s sanctions the \u201cfirst aspect\u201d of the administration\u2019s response was a denial that the U.S. had been involved in the outage that struck North Korea\u2019s tiny corner of the Internet last week. ", " They declined to answer directly. A senior administration official said there are \u201cmany possible explanations\u201d for the outage, including self-infliction, but had no comment on whatever covert actions might be taking place in addition to Friday\u2019s sanctions. ", " Under the order, Treasury designated a North Korean intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau; which officials said is responsible for the bulk of the nation\u2019s cyber operations; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation, or KOMID; and the Korea Tangun Trading Corporation. The two companies are involved in technology and R&D procurement for North Korea\u2019s defense and ballistic missile programs, according to the Treasury Department. ", " Treasury also named 10 people affiliated with those entities for sanction. Kil Jong Hun and Kim Kwang Yon represent KOMID\u2019s south African interests; Jang Song Chol represents KOMID in Russia and works with Sudanese procurers; Kim Yong Chol and Jang Yong Son represent KOMID in Iran; Kim Kyu is KOMID\u2019s external affairs officer; Ryu Jin and Kang Ryong are KOMID officials in Syria; Yu Kwang Ho is a North Korean government official; and Kim Kwang Chun is a Korea Tangun Trading Corporation representative in China, according to Treasury. ", " All three of the organizations sanctioned Friday have been previously sanctioned by the U.S. and in some cases by the United Nations. None of the 10 individuals have been previously sanctioned. ", " Administration officials could not say if any of them currently have any assets with U.S. financial institutions or would be immediately impacted by Friday\u2019s announcement, but said the goal was to send a signal to the international community. ", " The administration is confident that regardless of connections to the U.S., Friday\u2019s actions will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on their ability to operate. ", " \u2018\u201dI think more importantly, perhaps, than whether they have any assets in the U.S., these individuals are now known to the world to be representatives of KOMID, North Korea\u2019s primary arms dealer around the world. Their ability to access the financial system anywhere is going to be impaired by today\u2019s actions because banks everywhere will take note \u2026 and will make life quite difficult for any of these individuals to continue to work on behalf of KOMID or for that matter to have any sort of financial activity altogether,\u201d the official said. ", " Experts say that while the sanctions may not have an immediate impact, they are an important step by the U.S. ", " \u201cIn general, I think the administration\u2019s response has been pretty good,\u201d said Atlantic Council expert and former White House cyber official Jason Healey. \u201cThey\u2019ve said more is to come, that it\u2019ll be proportional. We didn\u2019t have a lot of good cards to play, and they\u2019re playing their hand relatively well.\u201d ", " Healey said the administration is smart to make the issue less about the cyberattack itself, and more about the problem of North Korea generally by sanctioning individuals tied to the government as opposed to the attack. ", " That idea was echoed by New America Foundation strategist and senior fellow Peter Singer, who said even if the sanctions won\u2019t necessarily be felt in North Korea or won\u2019t bring about regime change, they do send an important message in terms of precedent. ", " \u201cThis is not solely about North Korea, it\u2019s about sending a signal to the rest of the world and rolling back the unfortunate precedent that Sony and the movie theaters [not initially releasing the film] set for us, which is there\u2019s no cost to a cyberattack,\u201d Singer said. \u201cSo even if this is not as effective against an economy that\u2019s already heavily sanctioned and is incredibly weak and individuals who don\u2019t travel around the world, if you\u2019re someone who \u2026 has broader interests or you\u2019re an individual who likes to go to the South of France or Maldives, these are the kind of consequences that might happen to you.\u201d ", " \u201cIt\u2019s precedent-setting in terms of both that we would react to a cyberattack on a private company and how we are reacting,\u201d Singer added. ", " The president is currently on a family vacation in Hawaii, but said in ", " to House Speaker John Boehner announcing the sanctions that they reflect a determination that the cyberattack was a threat to U.S. national security. ", " \u201cI have now determined that that the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087 and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d Obama wrote. ", " The FBI announced it had concluded North Korea was behind the attack, which wiped out Sony\u2019s servers and computer network for a week and dumped massive amounts of sensitive company data, emails and other intellectual property on the Internet, on Dec. 19. ", " Obama reiterated the government\u2019s determination of North Korea\u2019s responsibility at a press conference that day before leaving for his Hawaiian trip, and pledged a \u201cproportionate response.\u201d Friday\u2019s sanctions are the U.S. government\u2019s first declared response since that day. ", " In the interim, the cybersecurity community has expressed skepticism of North Korea\u2019s culpability based on the indicators the FBI cited as evidence for its conclusion, but officials and the FBI have remained firm that there is no evidence suggesting any other entity is behind the attack. ", " In Friday\u2019s call an official said the FBI is \u201cstanding by our assessment\u201d and has access to channels for intelligence that private security firms do not.

I think it has inspired people all over the world and sometimes, persuaded them to tolerate a bit more power from the United States than they might tolerate from other great powers [laughs] because we\u2019ve managed to convince them more often than not that America uses that power for the common good, for the betterment of the world.", "When we have not lived up to that ideal; when we have screwed up, as we have many, many times, the one thing that brings us back is the sense that we are supposed to do better. So, we judge ourselves in accordance with this very high standard. And all of our presidents really since Jimmy Carter at least have explicitly made the promotion of human rights and freedoms and democracy part of our foreign policy. We\u2019ve always debated how to do it, and I\u2019ve served under two presidents: President Clinton and President Obama, and we had all kinds of arguments. How do we do it in Saudi Arabia? Should we intervene in countries like Syria or Bosnia or Libya when people are in trouble? How do we deal with countries that are partners on terrorism or security but also abuse their people?", "And we have these arguments about the means, but we\u2019ve always agreed on the ends. Every president has believed that America is better off if people around the world have greater freedoms, and that is the radical shift that we\u2019re experiencing now. ", "Well, it\u2019s interpreting that you make this point; that we\u2019re now at a point where arguably the Trump administration or at least the president himself. Maybe not everybody in it. Obviously, there are some people, like U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who are pursuing their own more traditional version of American foreign policy at the moment, and we can talk about that. So you\u2019re making this argument basically that that\u2019s the disjuncture of President Trump?", "I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people, as I\u2019m sure you have around Washington, though, who think there is more continuity than people would like to acknowledge between President Obama and President Trump when it comes to this issue of imposing sort of an American vision of the world onto other countries. President Obama obviously had a different demeanor, but he, too, shared some attributes with President Trump [such as his] weariness about projecting values at the heart of our foreign policy. He was kind of a Democratic version of a realist. ", " I don\u2019t agree with that. I think there has always been a wariness in American foreign policy to varying degrees of imposing, interfering, getting ourselves embroiled in complicated foreign situations. Sometimes we do it. Sometimes we hold back. But it\u2019s all a debate about the means. President Obama embraced the Arab Spring. He spoke out in favor of dissidents in Egypt and Bahrain and Libya. He intervened militarily in Libya to support the revolution there. His initial speech in the region\u2014at the famous speech in Cairo ...", " The Cairo speech.", "was all about the potential for political transformation and how that\u2019s the key to fighting terrorism and extremism. And then in his farewell address, like that of every president since forever was, as you mentioned, a tribute to this quality of American leadership around the world. Now, some people criticized us in the Obama administration for not doing more in some places. Some people felt we did too much. But President Obama, like President Bush, like President Reagan, like President Clinton, believed that we would be better off if people in Saudi Arabia had the right to choose their leaders, if women had the right to drive. If folks in countries that are beset by extremism had peaceful ways of expressing their grievances. And what\u2019s very, very different\u2014it\u2019s not there\u2019s a different tone or a different way of doing things in this administration; it\u2019s that President Trump has explicitly said that he is just not interested in advancing this aim and by his words and actions.", "And almost more important, his body language: You can just tell that he has a clear preference for, admiration for strong men and dictators. My goodness, he even has explicitly praised the president of the Philippines campaign of murdering drug users and drug dealers in the thousands. This is, I have to say, just obscene and a complete departure from decades of American tradition. ", " It\u2019s hard to imagine who would be a successor to you as an assistant secretary in charge of Human Rights in the Trump administration. We can talk a little bit more later on what\u2019s going on inside the State Department since you\u2019ve left. But I want to keep on this Obama thing. Take us behind the curtain a little bit. You pointed out, obviously, there were many debates. One of the things that was striking was President Obama\u2019s own evolution. He is famous for this stirring rhetoric. He gives this Cairo speech. He\u2019s given many speeches that invoked the grandiose nature of American commitment to the world and its transformational view really of why what happens inside other countries matters to them and to the rest of us. And yet, dot, dot, dot.", "And yet, the Syria Civil War unfolded on his watch. Six years, hundreds of thousands dead. Millions of refugees. This is surely going to be a blot on President Obama\u2019s record. He had the ability to do many things he chose in the end not to do. It was a series of circular and for you, I\u2019m sure, very painful debates. You were supportive at various points in time of doing more. Give us a little bit of a window into what this abstract human rights debate looks like in practice. I mean, your job was to be the guy at the table standing up for those principles and yet, again and again, that collides with a lot of other competing realities for a president forced to make those decisions.", "It\u2019s complicated, in one word, our experience in Syria \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of having worked for President Obama. I think he championed freedom around the world. He championed our interests around the world. He demonstrated extraordinary integrity in doing so. In seriousness, obviously, two smart people agree on everything, one of them isn\u2019t thinking\u2014 that\u2019s the old clich\u00e9. And Syria is a place where I wish we had done more. And I think our experience in Syria is probably the most powerful recent argument for America caring about human rights in other countries. Because this was a small, a relatively unimportant country thousands and thousands of miles away. And one day, a bunch of teenagers; 14-, 15-year-old boys, spray some graffiti on a wall and they get picked up by the police and they get tortured and then the people of their town get pissed off and start demonstrating and then more people get arrested and then more people get angry.", "And before we know it, we have a revolution against a brutal dictator that ultimately results in millions of refugees walking to Europe, upending the politics of our closest allies, sparking in part this wave of right-wing populism that we\u2019re all struggling with right now. And, on top of that, the formation of ISIS, a terrorist movement that is worse than Al Qaeda. And all because of a dysfunctional relationship between a dictator and his people in a small country thousands of miles away. ", "So, however, folks think we should have dealt with that, and that\u2019s a really, really tough question \u2014 I think it is probably the most powerful proof that I can present that these issues should matter to the United States. ", "But you\u2019re in this job now. You were not in this position at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, but obviously, you came into the role much earlier in the game when there were more options available to the president and you and I talked throughout this period of time, including before you got the job. And you were very engaged with what are options that are real, that are concrete. How do I get support on Capitol Hill for taking various actions that might influence President Obama from your previous life as the Washington director of the Human Rights Watch, here. ", "You understood the different tools and levers available to lobby the president. You worked those. Your colleague, Samantha Power, obviously, pressed and pressed such that President Obama was reported to have essentially given up and rolled his eyes at her. What was it like? Why did President Obama, a man who, as you said, shares these values that you have? Why didn\u2019t he do more when we could have? Tell us what it was like when you were sitting at the table? ", " First of all, the debate about Syria was ultimately a debate about the hardest thing that a president has to do, and that is to make decisions about war and peace. Most of our \u2014 99 percent of our debates about human rights policy and foreign policy don\u2019t involve that kind of choice, and I think anybody who has not been the president needs to give some deference to the extraordinary burden that a preident who is command-in-chief and can send our men and women into battle has to bear. I can\u2019t speak for President Obama. I have, of course, listened to him many, many times, and I think his primary concern was rooted in our experience in Iraq. Rooted in a sense that we Americans sometimes have too much confidence in our ability to solve complicated problems in that part of the world, and sometimes we go in for the right reasons and we find ourselves stuck.", "And we find ourselves \u2014 I think he would argue, creating more problems than solving. And so, he asked a lot of, I think, legitimate questions. If we impose a no-fly zone. If we take the steps that some of us were recommending. What is the likely first, second, and third order effects?", " Was there a moment in time that you can look back on now and say, 'Wow, if only that particular meeting had gone differently?'", " I don\u2019t think there was, and I wasn\u2019t in meetings in the Oval Office at which ultimately these decisions were made. I think President Obama was simply never convinced that we could intervene against the Assad regime in a way that would resolve this situation without getting the United States of America stuck in another Middle Eastern conflict. Now, the irony is that we are now stuck in a difficult Middle Eastern conflict in Syria with not only daily airstrikes, but troops on the ground engaged in combat, which is far, far more than any proponent of humanitarian intervention Syria was proposing early on, and in my personal view, could have been avoided had we done a little bit more at an early point to stop that carnage. I cannot prove that I\u2019m right. ", "And the problem we are facing is the one that we must face today.", " I\u2019ve been particularly amazed at just how viscerally people in the region seem to take President Obama\u2019s views. There\u2019s nowhere in the world where the leaders have been so pro-Trump as in the Middle East and you go around \u2014you and I have both had this experience of talking with people in the region and there was just an absolute disregard for President Obama after eight years of this sort of grueling, trying to nudge things in a better direction at a time of arguably real unraveling in the Middle East. What do you attribute that to? Obviously, Europe has a very different point of view about Donald Trump but across the region \u2014 and this includes Israel as well as many of the Gulf States. There was a real disappointment in President Obama that was pretty palpable. Why do you think that is? Is it because he had pesky folks like you lecturing them about human rights?", " Well, it depends a lot on who you talk to. Eight years is a long time and the conflict in Syria, I think, took its toll on everybody. And it should have because it created so much harm, not just to the region but to the whole world, and everybody was frustrated with where we were on Syria at the end of the eight years of the Obama administration. But let\u2019s also be a little bit honest. The fundamental dispute that, for example, Saudi Arabia had with the Obama administration is that President Obama embraced the Arab Spring.", "And Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important priority in the last several years has not been to fight terrorism. It has not been to help the people of Syria. It has not even been to counter Iran. ", "It has been to push back these forces of rapid liberalization that the Arab Spring represented. And they never forgave us for the very simple statements that President Obama made in support of the Tahrir Square Revolution in Egypt. And by the same token, I think there are autocrats in the Middle East who see in the Trump administration a reflection of themselves. They see a president who mixes business and politics. A president who employs his family. A president who does not concern himself with values of democracy and freedom and rule of law. ", "A president whose former national security adviser could be put on one\u2019s payroll and I think there was a temporary moment in which a lot of autocratic leaders around the world breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of such an American administration. I also think that, as time goes by, they may get a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse. ", "Yeah, so tell us a little bit about that transition after this shocking election upset and it became clear to all of the tough customers in your human rights portfolio at the State Department that there was not going to be the Hillary Clinton administration that they had expected, but there was going to be a Donald Trump administration. You\u2019ve recounted one incident with a Central Asian diplomat basically chortling at this. You and your staff must have actually gotten a lot of pushback from people saying, 'Hey, there\u2019s going to be a new sheriff in town. Your finger wagging days are over.'", "Yeah, we knew the day after election day that there was really not much more that we could do and that was very, very sad and we heard about it from some of our interlocutors around the world. So you mentioned an ambassador from Central Asia who came by and saw one of my deputies and said, \u201cGosh, you guys must feel so stupid. All you\u2019ve been doing is talking democracy this and democracy that and free elections here and there, and now your own president-elect says that America\u2019s election was rigged and that 3 million people voted illegally. Gosh, you must feel so stupid.' ", "And so, I heard about this and I was a little bit pissed off. So I asked the guy to come and see me. And I said, 'I heard about what you said to my deputy. And I get where you\u2019re coming from. I know, given what Trump is saying, we\u2019re probably not going to be able to have some of the conversations with you guys that we had before about democracy. But I also want to ask you: How are you feeling?' Because again, this is a Central Asian country, and I said, 'You do realize that your country is not very important and that there\u2019s a lot of things that you like about' ...", "[Laughs] What talking from a diplomat. ", "Well, at this point, who cares? ", "Game over, yeah.", " 'You come from a small, relatively unimportant country, and you rely on the United States to back you up against your big neighbors, Russia and China. You do realize that the only reason we do that is because we have these principles. It\u2019s not because you really matter. And so, if America is going to have a transactional foreign policy where we align ourselves with big countries that can do stuff for us, you\u2019re probably going to be out of luck. How does that make you feel?'", "And he admitted that he was very, very nervous and then we had a much more honest conversation about the future. And Israel \u2014 my goodness. President Obama, I think, was pretty darn good to Israel in terms of aid and arms sales and backing them up at the U.N. \u2014 and in all kinds of other ways. But at the end of the day, Israel needs a United States of America that has authority in the world. If our relationship with our core European allies is shredded, that is not good for Israel. We\u2019re not going to be able to defend Israel if we are alone in the world. America First is not a great recipe for an effective partnership with Israel and protecting it against all of the threats that it faces. And virtually every country in the world, including the autocracies needs something from America that we give because we have a good heart, not just because we are self-interested. And I think \u2014 it\u2019s only been a few weeks and already some of the buyer\u2019s remorse may be setting in. ", "Well, what I\u2019m struck by is that, of course, these tensions always existed in American foreign policy and even in a democratic administration like the one you served in, it\u2019s not easy to balance those things. I\u2019m thinking of your own experience in Bahrain. Maybe we should talk about that when you were assistant secretary. Of course, that\u2019s a place that is very important to the Pentagon. It\u2019s very important to our strategic position in the Persian Gulf. The American 5th Fleet is headquartered there and what happened when you came to town and tried to meet with people they didn\u2019t want you to meet with.", "Nothing. What are you talking about? [Laughs] Our relationship with Bahrain is strong and solid and there\u2019s no problem. ", "Tom, you\u2019re not the assistant secretary.", "Oh, sorry. You\u2019re right..", "Put your other hat on, please.", "Well, there was that minor incident in which I was kicked out the country. I do recall now. Thank you for reminding me. So, yeah, Bahrain is an interesting case. It\u2019s important to us because we have a military base there, a very important strategic relationship. But it\u2019s also a country that is roughly evenly divided between Shia and Sunni. Actually, more Shia than Sunni \u2014 but it is ruled by a Sunni monarchy and naturally, the Shia majority would like to have more representation in the government. ", "We felt very, very strongly that it would be good for Bahrain and good for the Middle East as a whole for this country to live up to its stated commitment to political inclusion. To show this divide between Sunni and Shia can be overcome through democracy rather than something that can only be managed by one side dominating the other side. And so, we felt we had both security interests in a partnership with Bahrain but also security interests in nudging them toward greater democracy. ", "I went, interestingly, at their invitation, to go talk to them about this stuff and it was Ramadan and during Ramadan in Bahrain, there\u2019s a tradition of the Majlis where people, families, organizations, have receptions in their homes and you go and you pay your respects in the evening. And I started my trip by going to the Ramadan reception, the Majlis, of the main moderate Shia opposition party, Al-Wefaq, at which I had a conversation with the opposition leader, primarily about soccer and the World Cup, and we were laughing about that and pictures were snapped. ", "It showed up on social media and hard-liners in the Bahraini government flipped out, accusing me of meeting with the opposition before I met with the government, and I was PNGed by Twitter. PNG means \u201cpersona non-grata.\u201d", "When that happens to a diplomat, it\u2019s a big deal.", " It\u2019s a big deal. I think I am the first and probably still the only diplomat in the history of the world to have been PNGed by Twitter. It\u2019s a great honor. I\u2019m very proud. Thank you, Bahrain. ", "But now we live in the Trump era, so more Twitter PNGing is entirely possible. ", "It\u2019s entirely possible my record might be broken. But it was interesting. There was a little diplomatic crisis over this, as you can imagine. Our government didn\u2019t take kindly to that sort of treatment of a senior U.S. diplomat. A few months later, I went back and had a really good and warm conversation with the king of Bahrain and the crown prince and the whole government. I met the opposition again. We tried really, really hard to encourage a deal in which the opposition could run in freer elections in that country. Sadly, it failed.", "And here\u2019s what I think was interesting about this: There were a lot of people who were skeptical about what we were trying to do in Bahrain. Some of them felt that we really didn\u2019t have enough influence to really effectively promote democratic change in a country that was so arguably set in its autocratic ways. Other people argued, 'Well, we had influence but we just weren\u2019t using enough of it. We weren\u2019t trying hard enough.' Because it didn\u2019t seem like we were succeeding. Things remained bad. Now, Trump goes to Saudi Arabia. He meets with the king of Bahrain and instead of gently nudging him to respect human rights, he explicitly tells the king, 'We are not going to have this problem with you anymore. This is no longer an issue between us.'", "And within a few days, the government or Bahrain launches a much more violent and brutal and complete crackdown on dissent, free press, political opposition. And what that shows, to me, is that sometimes the measure of our success, when we promote these values overseas, is not a gloriously free and fair election, a glorious transformation to freedom and democracy, though sometimes that happens. Sometimes all we can do is just maintain a little bit of deterrence to keep the subject of human rights on the minds of the rulers in that country so that they feel like there are still some norms they can\u2019t break. There are still some lines that they can\u2019t cross. ", " So your role in the Obama administration was really \u2014 it was sort of like a journalist. I\u2019m thinking of that scene in ", "where the pesky kid gets beaten up by all of the other kids. That\u2019s usually the role of the journalist. But basically, the human rights guy at the table is kind of like that too. So when you don\u2019t have that guy around ...", "Well, it\u2019s not so much that human rights are cut when this is absent from our foreign policy. Things get a lot worse in the world. I think one of the ...", "Just to push back on that a little bit, when you were in this role did you feel like that they thought, 'Oh, here they go again. This is the price of doing business with the Americans that I have to have these people like Tom come and lecture me about the' ...", "Sometimes, but that\u2019s because I had the backing of the president and the secretary of state and the country and the Congress.", " That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That was the price of doing business with America was to listen to people like you. ", " But they were sensitive to what we had to say in most of these countries. There were a couple of places where I just felt like it\u2019s not worth going because all it would be is meeting with a bored official who just wants to get off ...", " Check a box?", "Check a box. But I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019d go to an autocratic country and have intense conversations, debates with presidents, the head of the secret police, the interior minister; conversations that would go on for hours in which they were striving with all of their might to try to justify themselves or to try to convince me that what they were doing was either different from what I thought or the right thing to do. And what that taught me \u2014 and I think this is a really important insight. Is that dictators are a lot more insecure about their legitimacy than elected leaders. ", "You get elected president of the United States or France, you don\u2019t have to be insecure about your legitimacy because it comes ...", "Well, we have one right now who is insecure, Tom, but ...", " Well, that\u2019s a unique circumstance but if you got elected fair and square, then you have a right to rule for your term. But most dictators know darn well that they\u2019re not legitimate so they desperately want our approval and they desperately want to avoid our disapproval. I was lobbied so many times by governments around the world to not issue public statements about their human rights record.", "They would send diplomats and say, 'Oh, Tom, I know you guys have these concerns but don\u2019t say anything publicly because it would be really counterproductive.' And every time they did that, it convinced me that we probably should issue that public statement because for whatever reason, they are really insecure about being called out. And when that stops \u2014 and this is, I think, maybe the silver lining in the current circumstances: that we are, for the next couple of years, going to be running a controlled experiment in what it means for the United States to be absent as a moral leader around the world. ", "The bad news is a lot of people are going to be harmed because of this. The good news, I hope, at the end of it is that we will see as clearly as we have never seen before the value of America playing that role because we will see the consequences of our absence. And if that\u2019s what we have to go through to understand clearly the value of America playing a principled role on the world stage and working with our allies to advance these values, then perhaps something good can come of this. ", "I always did think you had to be a pretty big optimist to take this kind of role and to take up human rights as your profession. Just quickly, because there\u2019s so much I want to ask you about what\u2019s happening right now. But why did you pick up human rights as your profession? It\u2019s an unusual career to make. There are a lot of people who talk about it but very few who actually spend their lives doing it. How did you come to this?", "Well, I think it\u2019s fun having arguments with dictators [laughs]. Very few get to do it as often as I have. ", " Well, and which dictator were you most interested to meet, by the way? ", " Well, that\u2019s a good question. I never got to spar with Putin. That would have been fun.", "I\u2019ve met Putin.", " ", " Well, you can tell me about that. But it\u2019s not ...", " I asked him about Chechnya, by the way. I was the skunk at the garden party in his first interview with Western reporters. And I was one of the most junior ones. This was in the spring of 2001. So they had gotten almost two-thirds of the way around the table before the question got to me, and no one had asked him about Chechnya and human rights, so I felt that I had to.", "Yeah, well, often, it\u2019s not the leader of the country that\u2019s most interesting. It could be the head of the police or even the head of the secret police and as you know from your Russian experience, often the smartest people in these countries are given the domestic internal security function. And it\u2019s interesting to me how folks like that often want to talk about what they do. I had a fascinating three-hour meeting with the head of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s secret police once before I was at the State Department. And we went at it on imprisoning dissidents, on torture and whether it was effective or not and he was as fascinated to meet me as I was fascinated to meet him.", "And do you ever convince somebody in a meeting like that? Of course not.", "But I always wanted to use those meetings to get it into the heads of these people that they are being watched, that somebody in the world who has power knows what they are doing, and that there may be at some point, as a consequence of those facts, consequences for that person if they cross a certain line. And again, taking that away, it\u2019s a radical change. ", "So I look back on being a diplomat and I think about all of the amazing, interesting conversations with leaders around the world and officials and how fascinating the issues were. Sometimes, I have to remind myself of the silly moments and how sometimes the dominant feeling you have is just being exhausted and you\u2019re going from meeting to meeting to meeting in a foreign country or perhaps doing what we used to call \u201cdiplomatic speed dating\u201d at the U.N., where you have 10 meetings a day with different countries for seven or eight days straight.", " This is every September when the U.N. General Assembly meets.", "That\u2019s right, and I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I probably had a lot of meetings with government ministers from other countries where I just didn\u2019t even know the name of the person I was meeting with \u2014 and it was on my briefing paper, but you forget. And a funny version of this happened at the U.N. when I was scheduled to meet \u2014 it was on my schedule \u2014 with the president of Burkina Faso, President Compaor\u00e9, the now former leader of that country, and he\u2019d been in power for decades and was trying to extend his stay by another term, contrary to his constitution. And back in that time, we had a policy of encouraging leaders all over the world to respect their constitutions; to leave when their term limits were up.", "And so I show up at his suite outside his door, and I see this gentleman walking down the hall toward us, and he sees me and he greets me, and says, 'Oh, are you here to see me?' And I said, 'Yes.' And I looked at him and I had once briefly met President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso and this did not look like President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, but I wasn\u2019t sure. So he led me into the suite and we sat down and we started this bilateral meeting. And I\u2019m still not sure who this man is and it is important to know because usually, you\u2019re talking about policy. 'Your government should pull its troops out of here or your government should release that political prisoner.'", "But here, I\u2019m talking about you, Mr. President, should leave office and so the personal pronoun becomes very important! And I\u2019m struggling for about five minutes, and then I notice to my relief, that he\u2019s wearing a small U.N. nametag, and I strained my eyes to look at it without appearing to strain my eyes to look at it and I noticed that it\u2019s the foreign minister of Burkina Faso and not the president. And I managed to adjust quickly enough to say that \"he\" should leave office rather than \"you, Sir.\" ", " Did the president even show up? ", "No, he never did.", "And did he leave office?", "He was made to leave office by his people. Had he listened to us, he would be in a much better shape right now. ", " Right, he was in a spate of coups, as I remember what happened a few years ago.", "And I thought to myself, You know, we are sometimes arrogant as Americans. I wonder if any visiting diplomat ever comes to Washington and sits down with our secretary of state and he\u2019s wondering to himself, 'Is this Kerry? Or is this Obama? Is this Obama? Who is this?'", "Is this Biden [laughter]?", "But you started this because you had a fascination with dictators and with autocratic societies.", "No, no, no. I skipped to something that was fun about it. I am interested in political change in autocratic societies. I was born in Poland when it was a Communist country. I was very inspired watching it as a kid in the Solidarity Revolution move toward democracy. I\u2019ve seen in my own experience the role that America plays in people\u2019s imaginations around the world, and so it gives me a lot of pride now. Especially as an immigrant to America to now ...", "And you came here when?", " I was 6 years old, and I do have that kind of immigrants' \u2014 the simple love of this country. And the idea that I could get on a plane and speak to a foreign leader with all of the might and majesty of the United States of America behind me, as a representative of our president, on behalf of our values. That makes me feel \u2014it was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever had a chance to do. And you\u2019ve asked some questions that suggest that this is a frustrating line of work to be in and actually, I don\u2019t see it that way. I think foreign policy, in general, is frustrating. Most of what we try to do that\u2019s interesting in the world, whether it\u2019s on human rights or countering proliferation or terrorism. Most of the stuff fails most of the time. I always said to my team at the State Department that it\u2019s kind of like baseball and if you\u2019re successful 30 percent of the time, you\u2019re going to the hall of fame because that\u2019s a .300 average.", "I also used to tell the folks in the Human Rights Bureau, which is what I ran \u2014 that 'you guys work for the part of the State Department that loses the most battles of any other part of the State Department.' And I pause and let that sink in and then I\u2019d say, 'You also work for the part of the State Department that wins the most battles of any other part of the organization. Now, how can that be? Because you pick the most battles of anyone. You\u2019re working on these really hard issues that inherently involve friction between us and those in the diplomatic apparatus who are mostly focused on maintaining relations with other states.' ", "And inherently, it causes friction between the United States and those other states. And so it\u2019s hard and you have to fight all the time. But we do win a lot of these fights as a country and when we do, it\u2019s one of the most satisfying things in the world. ", "So what on Earth is going on with these folks? If you had to fight a lot of fights in the previous administration, what is happening to your former colleagues now? What did you tell them as you left and left them to Donald Trump?", "You make it sound as if ...", "I know you didn\u2019t have a choice but to leave. ", " Yeah, that\u2019s true. I had to abandon ship. I told them ...", "And you were there right up until January 20th, I should note. ", "I did, and I probably spoke to almost everybody on my large team about the difficulties ahead and I told them invariably that they should stay if they were career civil servants or foreign service officers, that they should do their best to do their duty under a new president. That there would be a lot of good people coming in with Trump that probably disagreed with him on a lot of stuff, and that there would probably be opportunities to make things better. And if they got to a point where that wasn\u2019t possible; well, then they could reevaluate. ", "Right now, I think they\u2019re all in a really, really tough spot. And I don\u2019t just mean people in the Human Rights Bureau but our entire diplomatic family. I think the choice that our career diplomats are facing right now is basically this: No. 1, you can try to make things better at the margins, while explaining to your foreign counterparts that they need to bear with us. As Secretary Mattis did on a recent trip to Australia. Or you can try to lay low and work on some country or program that the president hopefully is not going to notice. And there\u2019s a lot the State Department does every day that Donald Trump is not going to think about.Or you can resign. ", "We saw a resignation just this last week with the number two \u2014 the acting ambassador in Beijing, who resigned citing the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Do you think we should expect more of that?", "I fear more of that. For the sake of the country, I hope nobody resigns because rebuilding a professional foreign and civil service is going to be really, really difficult if it, in fact, is eroded by this craziness. So I hope for our sake that folks find a way to stay. But obviously, if you are the person in that position, you have to also think about your own life and career and your own conscience. ", "Were there ways that you thought about at the time to sort of Trump-proof the system when it came to human rights? We can talk about your views on Russia. It\u2019s been reported that you and a colleague went up to Capitol Hill to talk to Sen. Cardin, who has been a big supporter of sanctions against Russia and human rights policy to talk about what could happen in order not to have the Trump administration lift sanctions on Russia. Tell us a little bit about that effort and why you think he hasn\u2019t lifted sanctions on Russia yet and then we can talk about other kinds of issues like that, where it may make a difference. ", " I think he wanted to lift sanctions. He said he did. It wasn\u2019t a surprise when we learned in the first few days of the new administration that his team was asking for options. ", "That\u2019s right. You and I talked about it at the time.", "That\u2019s right, and again, I was shocked in a way, because I thought it was a terrible idea but I was not surprised because after all, it was what he said he would do. ", " And in your view, this is very much connected with his affinity with Putin? ", "I do. I don\u2019t know about collusion. I don\u2019t know if there was a deal, but I actually think even if there was, it goes beyond that. I think Trump is basically driven by a desire to be liked and not to be disapproved of. And the Saudis and the Emiratis like him and they don\u2019t wag their fingers at him. Putin said nice things about him and our European allies that have bled and sacrificed with us in every war since the beginning of the last century; he senses that they disapprove of him and so, therefore, they\u2019re bad.", "I don\u2019t think it goes that much beyond that. I also think just Putin and Trump in some ways are similar characters. They both have authoritarian instincts. So I think there is a mutual sympathy there. I think he also likes big countries more than small countries and when you see the world in transactional terms, Russia is a much more important potential friend than say, Lithuania. Russia can do a lot more for us or to us than Lithuania. So it makes sense from that point of view. ", "So you went up to see Cardin. What was the goal of that?", "I told Sen. Cardin and others on Capitol Hill that I had heard that they were indeed moving in this direction. That they should exercise their authority to call in State Department officials for briefings to ask them what\u2019s going on. And at that point, the State Department would then tell them what\u2019s going on. And I encouraged them to move forward legislation that would codify into law the sanctions that President Obama had imposed by executive order, which Sen. Cardin, with a large bipartisan group of co-sponsors; Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain proceeded to do. ", "The think the very clear message that the Trump administration got from the Congress at that point and then the firing of Gen. Mike Flynn and the growing pressure of the Russia investigation combined to stay the president\u2019s hand.", "Was that the only issue that you felt was warranting of that level of kind of emergency attention at that point in time? Were there other issues in that transition period that you thought, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do something about now to make sure we don\u2019t get a bad outcome.\u201d ", "Well, Russia was the main thing and a number of us also endeavored to make sure that any evidence that had been gathered by our intelligence community of inappropriate behavior of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, that that evidence be preserved, that it be shared with appropriately cleared members of Congress.", " What does that mean? That you endeavored to make sure that people on Capitol Hill had copies of this? ", "Yeah, absolutely and again, we\u2019re not talking about leaks here. We\u2019re talking about senior members of Congress who had a right to know and who had access, but who needed to know what to ask for and so that was done and I think it was the right thing to do. After, of course, then after President Trump took over, there were a number of executive orders from the awful Muslim travel and refugee ban that a number of us rallied to try to oppose. There were other things that had been suggested that didn\u2019t happen. The planned designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, for example. ", "Which I think was also headed off by a lot of smart, external advocacy. ", " Right, so basically, finding out about that quickly and flagging it for people. ", "Yeah, that\u2019s right. ", "So that\u2019s a sort of a form of external resistance, if you will. ", "Yeah, perfectly appropriate. It\u2019s how the policy debate always goes, except, in this case, we felt that there were moves afoot that went well beyond the norms of what Republican or Democratic administrations would have considered appropriate in the past. ", "So that Muslim Brotherhood thing is one thing. The Russia thing is another. Are there a couple of other examples that you think are outside the norm? ", "I think the biggest thing and they tried to do it was the travel ban, which I thought was transparently an effort to limit travel to and immigration to the United States from Muslim majority countries that did not do business with the Trump organization. And I mean that literally because that was the distinction. He did not do this to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates or to Egypt or to countries which were on his nice list because he had these relationships.", "Well, look, this is obviously, a good example also of where it\u2019s not just Congress who are an external advocacy but the court\u2019s system is clearly going to make that decision. ", "Well, ultimately the courts did and I think, again, silver linings. I think we had an effort by a president to do something that was un-American and unconstitutional and that sent a very terrible message to the world about our own commitment to democracy and the rule of law. But then, our institutions responded marvelously. And in that case, the courts have so far prevented the president from implementing this order and I hope the rest of the world sees that as an example of what is good and strong about American democracy. ", "Well, as I said, you are definitely a glass-half-full optimist. The rest of the world is experiencing a lot of schadenfreude these days when it comes to what\u2019s happening inside the United States. But let me close by putting it back on you for a little bit of a lightning round. We are kind of distracted here in Washington by this sort of spectacle of the Trump White House and the leaks and who is up and who is down. What are a couple of places in the world that you think we should be paying more attention where we\u2019re not so distracted? Are there things that we\u2019re missing because of this big set of stories here at home? I\u2019m thinking this unraveling of Turkey is one good example of one place that has been on a kind of alarming trajectory. Are there other things you\u2019re watching? ", " I think even those of us who have spent years thinking primarily about foreign policy are focused mostly right now on what\u2019s going on in our own country.And I find myself picking up the newspaper and reading about something that\u2019s happening in Bahrain, or in Burma, or in Sri Lanka, or Ethiopia, or in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, countries that I care deeply about and I\u2019ve worked on and I think are important to the United States. And yet, I feel like, 'You know what? We\u2019ve got to take care of our business here because if America \u2014 there are things happening in the United States right now that make it impossible for the United States to effectively promote peace, democracy, rule of law, stability, around the world.'", "Our strength comes first and foremost from the example that we set and the questions about the integrity of our own democracy have to be settled, I think, before we can effectively play that role again. And yet, our State Department, our Defense Department, they still have to try to maintain a holding pattern in situations of crisis around the world. So yeah, no one is paying attention to Burma. No one is paying attention to Sri Lanka. How much time are we even spending on Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have been huge priorities for the United States? There\u2019s a humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic. The Ukraine. I think we have a Ukraine policy, but we used to have a State Department that was intensely engaged in trying to help that critical country in crisis build a stronger, more stable democracy. We were helping them on anti-corruption.", "We were helping them build up better rule of law. We were talking to them about protecting their media space against Russian propaganda. But not only does there seem to be no intention to do that sort of thing right now. There\u2019s really nobody to do it because we don\u2019t have any senior diplomats. ", "Strobe Talbott was my guest on the podcast a couple of weeks back and quoted a high-level Asian diplomat visitor to his office as saying, \u201cYes, I\u2019m here because Washington, DC is now the epicenter of political instability in the world.\u201d It\u2019s hard for us maybe to adjust to that fact but I guess it\u2019s a new normal.

Yet when Hillary Clinton, the Democrats\u2019 presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, held a news conference about her private email use last week \u2014 a media frenzy that functioned, albeit inadvertently, as the informal launch to her highly anticipated campaign \u2014 less than 13 percent of the total cable news audience was tuned to the network. ", " The low turnout wasn\u2019t a fluke: Year-to-date, MSNBC\u2019s daytime viewership is down 21 percent overall and 41 percent in the coveted 25-to-54-year-old demographic, putting it in fourth place behind Fox News, CNN and CNN\u2019s sister network HLN. Its prime-time ratings are down 24 percent and 42 percent, respectively. In both daytime and prime time, MSNBC is bringing in its smallest share of the demo since 2005, the year before Keith Olbermann\u2019s scorched-earth admonitions of the Bush administration ushered in the current era of Rachel Maddow, Ed Schultz and Al Sharpton. ", "Story Continued Below", " In a memo to staff in December, MSNBC President Phil Griffin conceded that the network is suffering: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that 2014 was a difficult year for the entire cable news industry and especially for MSNBC,\u201d he wrote. But change was coming, Griffin promised, with \u201cmore announcements in the New Year.\u201d ", " The extent of that change could be vast: In the months ahead, MSNBC is likely to shake up the bulk of its programming, moving some shows and canceling others, high-level sources at NBCUniversal told POLITICO. With a few exceptions \u2014 notably \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d and \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 every program is at risk of being moved or canceled, those sources said. \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes,\u201d a ratings suck that currently occupies the 8 p.m. time slot, will almost certainly be replaced. Network execs are also considering moving some weekday shows, like \u201cPolitics Nation with Al Sharpton,\u201d to weekends. ", " \u201cThe plan is to re-imagine what the channel is,\u201d one high-level NBCUniversal insider with knowledge of the network\u2019s plans said, \u201cbecause the current lineup is a death wish.\u201d ", " The changes, which Griffin has already set in motion with the cancellation of the little-watched daytime shows \u201cRonan Farrow\u201d and \u201cReid Report,\u201d are likely to be hastened by the arrival of new NBC News Group Chairman Andrew Lack, who will serve as Griffin\u2019s boss. ", " Lack, a former NBC News president, is likely to rein in MSNBC\u2019s ever-leftward drift and focus instead on creating more news-driven programming, with more involvement from NBC News talent. This could become a radical change of course for MSNBC, where partisan, opinion-based programming has come to dominate the vast majority of the network\u2019s lineup in both daytime and prime time. Lack is likely to keep Griffin at MSNBC\u2019s helm, network sources said, because his seven years as president make him best-suited to implement the changes. ", " Griffin and Lack declined to be interviewed for this article. Rachel Racusen, a former Obama administration spokeswoman who now serves as the network\u2019s vice president of communications, denied that the network is considering plans to move or cancel Hayes and Sharpton: \u201cContrary to rumors that have already been reported on, there are no plans to move either Rev. Sharpton\u2019s or Chris Hayes\u2019 shows,\u201d she told POLITICO. ", " For many media watchers, Griffin\u2019s decision to pull the shows of Ronan Farrow and Joy Reid \u2014 both have become \u201ccorrespondents,\u201d in one form or another \u2014 seemed to reflect an acknowledgement that opinion-based programming wasn\u2019t working in daytime. (Griffin replaced the shows with a two-hour segment of \u201cMSNBC Live,\u201d which is more news-focused and less overtly ideological.) By the same token, MSNBC\u2019s defenders will often argue that the network\u2019s woes are due to Americans\u2019 waning interest in politics and liberals\u2019 disenchantment with President Barack Obama. This argument usually ignores Fox News\u2019 sustained success \u2014 it is and has long been the No. 1 cable news channel, through administrations Republican and Democratic. ", " In fact, MSNBC\u2019s problems run deeper than the news-opinion divide, several industry insiders said. The network\u2019s programming has grown stale, they say, while its principal rival, CNN, has been ascendant. Much of the younger talent consists of entertainers with no reportorial chops who can be hard to take seriously. Veteran hosts seem to have grown tired of trumpeting liberal outrage night after night, these critics say, and have become caricatures of themselves. The calculus for Griffin and Lack, then, is not just about balancing news and ideology. It\u2019s about creating compelling programming. ", " \u201cMSNBC got boring,\u201d one former NBCUniversal executive said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear a lot of people talking about it being too far left, too political \u2014 all that matters is that it\u2019s entertaining.\u201d ", " The MSNBC of today is a radically different animal than the one Lack helped create as president of the news division in 1996. At the time, Lack and his colleagues envisioned the network as a smarter version of CNN, with straightforward news programming and analysis from across the political spectrum. MSNBC would effectively function as a 24-hour cable platform for NBC. In theory, the channel would give NBC News a huge leg up over its competitors, who were limited to their morning and evening broadcasts. ", " That all changed in 2006 with Olbermann\u2019s diatribes against the Bush administration, Republican lawmakers and conservative media. Inspired by Olbermann\u2019s success, the network began to rebrand itself as the liberal answer to Fox News \u2014 a savvy business calculation, given Roger Ailes\u2019 success in turning that network into the right\u2019s most influential media platform. Griffin became president in July 2008, when \u201chope and change\u201d were sweeping the nation, and gave Rachel Maddow, Olbermann\u2019s substitute host, her own show the next month. It soon became the highest-rated show on MSNBC. ", " Since then, and especially after Olbermann\u2019s departure in 2011 (he had been suspended for political donations), Griffin began building the prime-time lineup around Maddow. Liberal opinion shows began to dominate more and more of the lineup, bleeding backward from prime time into the early evening and the afternoons. Maddow\u2019s own influence within the network grew as well. In March 2013, her own disciple, liberal magazine writer Chris Hayes, was given a prime-time show at 8 p.m. ", " For some NBC insiders, the failure of \u201cAll In\u201d \u2014 Hayes is a distant third place to Fox\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, both in total and in the demo \u2014 is indicative of the limits of Griffin\u2019s reactive approach to programming. Unlike Ailes, Griffin didn\u2019t set out to create a partisan network because he believed in the ideology. He did it because it made sense from a business perspective. Olbermann was popular, so he gave Maddow a show. Maddow was popular, so he gave Hayes a show. The problem is that not every disciple is as good as the mentor. Maddow was a groundbreaking liberal voice, an entertainer and the first openly gay prime-time news anchor. Hayes was just a smart kid from Brown University. ", " Hayes is now the most likely host to be moved from prime time, according to several NBCUniversal sources. Schultz and Sharpton, the network\u2019s loudest trumpeters of liberal outrage, could also be relocated, possibly to weekends. Schultz, who was already moved to weekends once before, is seen as unpalatable, a Rush Limbaugh of the left. Sharpton is a walking conflict of interest for the network because of his role as a prominent civil rights activist. (Racusen, the MSNBC spokeswoman, said there were no plans to move either.)

After the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, leaped to their defense, Trump hit back in a Sunday tweetstorm that included blaming Corker for the Iran deal he had voted against. By Sunday evening, the Senate\u2019s top foreign policy leader was calling the president of the United States a risk to put the country \u201con the path to World War III\u201d and deriding his White House as \u201cadult day care.\u201d ", "The interview with Cotton took place before this latest explosive twist, but even then it was clear a new rift of significance was opening up inside the Republican foreign policy world. I spoke with Cotton Thursday, the day after Tillerson\u2019s unusual press conference to deny press reports he was considering quitting, and just a couple hours after Cotton was summoned to the White House for a private Oval Office meeting with Trump to discuss the Iran strategy. In the interview, Cotton did not really try to paper over the rift or offer the usual assurances that it would all be papered over. Instead, when I asked him directly whether there would be resignations, Cotton did not say there wouldn\u2019t be, only that he did not believe they were \u201cimminent.\u201d ", "Cotton, an ambitious Harvard graduate and veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who has only just turned 40 as he serves his first Senate term, was similarly coy when I asked at the end of our conversation whether he would consider leaving the Senate for a major Trump administration post should one become available, saying only that he liked his current job in the Senate.

", "It was, at least in those initial few months, a stark contrast with the approach taken by Senator John McCain, who generally holds similar views but from the beginning let loose a string of critical press releases and scathing Twitter commentary on Trump\u2019s apostasy from the Republican foreign policy creed.", "Indeed, when I interviewed Corker for an early edition of The Global Politico back in February, the extent to which he was trying hard to justify working with Trump and persuading him from the inside was notable \u2013 and his frustration with the McCains of the world was palpable. When I listed the areas he seemed to disagree with Trump on \u2013 a long list that covered everything from Russia policy to blowing up trade deals \u2013 Corker at the time fretted about a head-on collision with such a confrontational figure as Trump.

Corker, who recently decided not to run for reelection, has been acting like a man liberated to speak his mind about Trump, as his explosive interview last night with the ", " showed, and he now seems entirely unwilling to back down from the confrontation he once feared. ", "Which makes it all the more interesting to talk Trump and foreign policy for an hour with Cotton amid the escalating feud. ", "Because Cotton today is one of the few Senate Republicans who pay close attention to foreign policy who is still out there making Corker\u2019s initial case for engagement with Trump, and he insists it\u2019s paying off with substantive shifts in Trump\u2019s thinking on subjects as varied as how to deal with Russia and the continuation of the war in Afghanistan. ", "Screen out some of the inflammatory rhetoric, Cotton maintains, and \u201cI would submit that his foreign policy, over these first nine months in office, is much more in keeping with the bipartisan tradition of foreign policy, starting with Truman in 1945 and going through George Bush in 2009, than President Obama\u2019s policy was,\u201d Cotton says. \u201cIn almost every area, in his own way, with his own rhetoric, he has reasserted American leadership, and he\u2019s willing to confront threats before they gather.\u201d ", "In the interview, Cotton argues that Trump\u2019s national security team \u201cchanged for the better on two occasions\u201d so far in his short tenure. The first came when Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and brought in Cotton\u2019s recommendation, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. The second came when the president fired his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replaced him with John Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general also touted by Cotton. \u201cI can see that from where I sit and the kind of interactions we have with the White House and my office, before and after both of those,\u201d he says. ", "Cotton also says the fact that the two generals are both steeped in the military chain of command is a plus when dealing with the prickly president.", "\u201cThey understand they\u2019re not the president,\u201d Cotton says in what seems at least an implicit nod to the view among the commentariat that the generals are there to oversee, or even constrain, Trump, from his own worst impulses. \u201cDonald Trump is the president. Their job is to advise. His job is to decide. Their job is to make sure he has the best facts, the best thinking, presented to him in an orderly fashion and ready for decision. But he decides and they move out and execute. ", "As for substantive policy shifts, Cotton cites Afghanistan, where McMaster, Mattis and Tillerson spent months persuading Trump \u2013 against all his instincts, as the president later publicly acknowledged \u2013 to double-down on the war that just hit the 16-year mark this week by sending several thousand additional troops. ", "\u201cThat\u2019s the way the policymaking process should work,\u201d Cotton says in a response that seems worth quoting in full: ", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a cabinet member, when you\u2019re a senior advisor in the White House, and the president is right, you should help him achieve his objectives and run with his thinking. When you think the president is wrong, you have a duty to try to present to him the best facts and the best thinking to help him see it in a different light. Maybe you can, but if he doesn\u2019t, and he says, \u2018No, I want to do it my way,\u2019 then your job is to move out and execute. And if you feel strongly enough, then you have to resign. \u201c", "Which, of course, brings us right back to the present moment \u2013 and the rift that the Iran deal seems to have opened up on Trump\u2019s already conflicted team.", "Until now, Trump has shied away from outright confrontation with the experienced hands he\u2019s hired to oversee his national security policy. But the Iran deal now seems to have finally forced a public rupture. ", "Cotton, who has repeatedly consulted with Trump and other top White House officials in recent days, appears to be on the winning side, pushing Trump to adopt the formula his administration has now settled on of refusing to re-certify the Iran deal to Congress but holding off \u2013 for now \u2013 asking Congress to blow it up by imposing new sanctions. Iran \u201cis on the president\u2019s mind right now, probably more than anything,\u201d Cotton says, and he says he believes Trump will take the step of not certifying as a way to send \u201ca very important signal to Congress and to our E.U. plus three partners and to Iran that this president is not going to abide by a disastrous nuclear deal.\u201d ", "Beyond the rhetoric, though, Cotton acknowledges the idea is not \u201cto re-impose sanctions immediately\u201d \u2013 an act that would be tantamount to blowing up the agreement \u2013 but instead give \u201ccoercive diplomacy\u201d time to work. Cotton envisions Trump using the threat of imminent congressional action \u2013 Cotton declines to say how long, but suggests a deadline of \u201cweeks or months\u201d \u2013 to get U.S. allies in Europe and the Mideast on board with a plan to revisit the deal with Iran and secure more concessions on areas such as Iranian ballistic missile development, which is continuing and outside the deal right now; and ending the so-called \u201csunset clause\u201d after which Iran might be free to resume its nuclear program.", "Tillerson and Mattis have reportedly signed off on the final plan, which Trump is supposed to make public in a speech this week in advance of an October 15 deadline for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the deal to Congress, as he is legally required to do every 60 days. But multiple sources have said that Tillerson privately lobbied Trump hard in favor of certification at least one more time, while Mattis, queried directly about this in his Senate testimony the other day, went public with his view that the deal in its current form remains \u201cin the national interest\u201d \u2013 precisely the opposite of what Trump is set to declare this week.", "Cotton gave a lengthy address at the Council on Foreign Relations the same day as Mattis\u2019 testimony taking the opposite view \u2013 and a link to it was soon tweeted out approvingly by an Iran deal hardliner inside the administration, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. ", "I asked Cotton about that Mattis statement, and how Trump should proceed given the obvious \u2013 and clearly consequential \u2013 moment of potential rift with the Pentagon chief. Even before last week\u2019s all but open break with Tillerson, Trump had often expressed frustration over the secretary of state, but he has yet to really feud with Mattis almost alone among his top officials. ", "\u201cOn that specific point, I simply disagree with him,\u201d Cotton told me of Mattis. \u201cAt root, though, we don\u2019t have secretaries of state and secretaries of defense to make these decisions. We elect a president, who\u2019s democratically accountable to the American people. And they say, in baseball, that the longest 18 inches is the difference between the assistant coach\u2019s seat on the bench and the manager\u2019s seat.

If Trump tried to unravel it, Zarif said in the interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs, Iran would consider everything from \u201cwalking away from the deal to somehow accommodating Europe.\u201d", "Spend an hour with Zarif, the American-educated diplomat who brokered the agreement two years ago with Barack Obama\u2019s administration and five other major world powers, and it\u2019s clear that he thinks Iran bested Trump at the U.N. over the past couple weeks.", "After all,", "Trump publicly widened the rift with European allies even as his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson failed to persuade them privately\u2014or even make a coherent case\u2014for blowing up the nuclear accord, potentially doing long-term damage to the U.S. ability to cut deals with any number of global bad actors. \u201cThe Europeans have made it very clear to us and to the United States that they intend to do their utmost to ensure survival of the deal,\u201d Zarif said, using some of his strongest public language yet for a series of backstage meetings that made clear what a striking gap Trump has opened up between the Americans and their closest allies.", "Zarif\u2019s stinging comments about Trump\u2019s efforts come at a key decision point on Iran for the president and Tillerson. While the Iran deal crisis has been publicly overshadowed in recent days by the president\u2019s war of words with nuclear-armed North Korea, it has provoked a major behind-the-scenes battle pitting an increasingly isolated Tillerson against other Trump advisers ahead of an October 15 deadline for the president to certify Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal\u2014or send the issue back to Congress.", "Tillerson, whom Trump publicly smacked down on Twitter Sunday over his efforts to open back-channel talks with the North Koreans, has waged a lonely fight against \u201cdecertification\u201d of the Iran deal as well, according to several of those I spoke with who have been briefed on the internal debates and expect the president to overrule the secretary on this too. ", "\u201cTillerson is still trying to convince Trump,\u201d said a key outside adviser to the White House. Another source briefed on the deliberations in the Pentagon and State Department said Tillerson had support there but not in the White House\u2014and even those who disagree with decertification \u201care now adjusting to the reality it is going to happen.\u201d They are \u201cnegotiating over the wording\u201d Trump will use, this source said, and the framing of the decision, which is likely to be accompanied by the rollout of what the White House is billing as a \u201cmajor new strategy\u201d to combat Iranian influence across the Middle East.", "In the interview, Zarif acknowledged that Trump has now created the expectation that he will refuse to recertify the nuclear deal\u2014while noting pointedly that Trump could still flip-flop on this, just as he has in so many other cases. \u201cThis would not be the first time that President Trump or other presidents have walked back from positions that they have taken during the campaign,\u201d he said. ", "Decertification by itself would not rip up the deal and Zarif noted that the Republican-controlled Congress could decide\u2014as it has in the past\u2014not to take any action following through on Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Doing nothing would effectively leave the deal in place, Zarif argues, and besides is essentially what he calls an \u201cinternal\u201d U.S. affair, since technically the nuclear accord is a U.N. Security Council resolution and not a congressional one anyway.", "\u201cIt\u2019s up to Congress to adopt any decision, or not to adopt any decision, and I believe in the past a Republican Congress had this idea to let the nuclear agreement stay, as did our Parliament,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cIt had decided in the past not to take action; it can decide again.\u201d", "Throughout the lengthy conversation in the wood-paneled reception room of the faded Upper East Side mansion that serves as Iran\u2019s U.N. headquarters, Zarif was unsparing in his critique of Trump. At various points, he bemoaned the American president\u2019s \u201cposturing,\u201d called out his \u201calternative facts\u201d as \u201cpublicity stunts,\u201d lamented his \u201cinsulting\u201d words and his \u201cdisappointing\u201d position, worried about his \u201cfrightening\u201d showdown with North Korea, and agreed with those who argue that Trump\u2019s overheated rhetoric has now made it easier rather than harder for Iran to command sympathy in the international arena.", "\u201cNow, look at the message that you are sending to the world,\u201d Zarif says. \u201cIt would make it tougher for anybody to believe and rely upon the United States\u2014anybody, not just North Korea. You\u2019ve seen U.S. allies saying that the United States is not a reliable partner.\u201d", "But it was equally striking what Zarif did not say. There was no Kim Jong Un-like retaliatory rhetoric, no \u201cDeath to America\u201d-type rants so familiar from past Iranian leaders. Instead, both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani were relatively restrained in their immediate response to Trump\u2019s U.N. speech\u2014Rouhani chose only to add three sentences to his U.N. address that did not mention Trump by name while warning of the hot-headed actions of a \u201crogue newcomer,\u201d and Zarif tweeted that it was \u201cunworthy of a reply.\u201d", "As much as anything, their response seemed to reflect Zarif\u2019s determination not to undercut the strong position the Iranians believe Trump has placed them in. \u201cThey think Trump has played into their hands the way he has gone after the deal,\u201d said another former U.S. official who has spoken with Zarif in recent days.", "At one point, I asked him whether Iran would also walk away from the deal if Trump went ahead with his threat to do so.", "\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Zarif said, at least not right away, what with Europe indicating it will stick with it and with Congress yet to act. \u201cWe will wait.\u201d", "***", "Ever since becoming President Rouhani\u2019s foreign minister four years ago, Javad Zarif\u2014a fluent English speaker whose international relations training came at the same Colorado graduate school that also turned out future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\u2014has been the West\u2019s favored Iranian interlocutor.", "He and Rouhani, who was just reelected to another presidential term, are seen as Iran\u2019s leading moderates, and both have staked their jobs on the survival and success of the nuclear deal they struck with the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain, France and Germany in 2015. Zarif today remains the \u201cunflappable,\u201d \u201cunflustered,\u201d \u201csmart and charming\u201d but also persnickety and at times even \u201cpetulant\u201d negotiator who haggled with the Americans over every detail, as a onetime aide to his negotiating partner, former Secretary of State John Kerry, described him to me the other day.", "But he is also seen as \u201cthe master of reading what people here\u2014in his mind\u2014ought to hear,\u201d said another former senior U.S official whose brief included Iran. \u201cHe is smart, worldly and comes across as eminently reasonable.\u201d", "There\u2019s just one problem, the official said: \u201cToo bad he doesn\u2019t make Iran\u2019s policies, especially in its region.\u201d", "That view is widespread in Washington, where most analysts consider hard-liners associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards the true decision-makers in Iran. Even supporters of the Iran nuclear deal find Zarif at times a frustrating adversary\u2014and most debate in the U.S. foreign policy circles of both parties tends to be over how to punish Iran\u2019s bad behavior, not whether it exists.", "All of which makes it more than a little jarring to talk about the politics of the Iran deal with Zarif in the midst of this latest crisis: He is the man in the middle of the international efforts to save the deal he cut, but appears to hold little sway over most of the other disputes that Washington and others have with his country, from the ongoing development of ballistic missiles that could eventually be used to deliver a nuclear warhead to backing for the murderous regime of Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad and support for Shiite proxy militias across the region.", "On the one hand, Zarif clearly has a strong case to make for his grievance about Trump\u2019s questioning of the nuclear deal. ", "The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly certified that Iran is complying with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the nuclear deal is formally known. Even Trump officials such as Tillerson and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford have publicly acknowledged in recent days that Iran is not only in \u201ctechnical compliance\u201d but that undoing the deal now would, as Dunford put it in congressional testimony, undercut future diplomacy with North Korea and others.", "\u201cIt makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there is a material breach, would have an impact on others\u2019 willingness to sign agreements,\u201d Dunford said, in a little-noticed rebuke of the president last week.", "But if Zarif is on solid ground on the letter of the nuclear deal itself, he\u2019s much shakier when it comes to defending Iran\u2019s actual behavior.", "Trump and American foreign policy hands in both parties view Iran as a destabilizing factor in the Middle East, allied with Russia and other problematic allies like Syria\u2019s Assad. Didn\u2019t he regret the enormous death toll in the Syrian civil war, I asked Zarif, where Iranian fighters and proxy militias have fought alongside Russians to keep Assad in power even as nearly half a million Syrians have been killed and millions more have been displaced from their homes?", "Zarif would hardly answer, instead deflecting blame on those who failed to consider conditions for peace talks he laid out four years ago.", "And what about Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on his own people, a repeatedly documented fact even after Assad cut a deal with the international community to supposedly remove those weapons?", "Iran, a victim of major chemical attacks by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, has long spoken out against the use of such weapons in other contexts. But in this, Zarif merely restated Iran\u2019s talking points, demanding a U.N. investigation and blaming \u201cthe United States and its allies\u201d who \u201cprevented\u201d it.", "He did not say, in our interview or in others he held over the past couple weeks, why Iran is still developing longer-range ballistic missiles\u2014only that doing so does not violate the technical language of the nuclear agreement.", "And more broadly, he left me uncertain as to why he would not consider negotiations with Trump at all\u2014given that Iran also has many grievances, including what it sees, with some legitimacy, as less-than-robust U.S. compliance with those aspects of the deal that are supposed to offer economic benefits to Iran.", " \u201cI think they don\u2019t quite know what to do with Trump other than just basically say no to everything,\u201d said one of the former U.S. officials who has spoken to Zarif in recent days.", "***", "In the end, the fight over the Iran deal may well depend on how correctly Zarif, his country\u2019s designated America-whisperer, reads the volatile new president.", "And he claims to have a pretty good fix on the place.", "\u201cI predicted Trump\u2019s victory,\u201d he tells me after we finished recording the podcast. He went on to recount how he had to overrule his staff at the Iranian Foreign Ministry after they prepared analyses of the 2016 election that only accounted for a Hillary Clinton victory. He also said he warned Mexico\u2019s foreign minister at the time that she was making a mistake by planning for a Clinton win. ", "How did you know Trump would score such a stunning upset?

GLASSER", "POLITICO", "This week, a special part two of The Global Politico, our report on the everyday culture of sexual harassment \u2014 and sexism \u2014 that still plagues women who dare to represent America in the world. Yesterday, we rolled out part one, a frank and at times disturbing conversation with six bad-ass women who\u2019ve worked in the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the State Department in recent years. They talked about men watching porn on their office computers, Special Forces dudes walking around the office in their underwear. \u2018We thought It was just the cost of doing business in the Pentagon,\u2019 said one of the women. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to it, I hope you will. ", "And now, today\u2019s episode takes us back to the Pentagon \u2014 and the Bad Old Days if you will, when there really weren\u2019t ANY women in national security, as in zero, zip, nada. Congresswoman Pat Schroeder was a key figure in changing that, she served in Congress for 24 years, even ran for president. A Colorado Democrat, she was on the Armed Services Committee, and she joined us on a recent visit to Washington to talk about what it was like to wage that lonely crusade in the 80s and 90s\u2014and all the resistance she faced. Then we\u2019ll hear from Deborah James, the second woman secretary of the Air Force. She served under President Obama, and actually was involved in some horrific cases while she was there \u2014 including disciplining a retired four-star general who forced a subordinate to have sex. Why didn\u2019t that case go national when all these other sensational new allegations are? We\u2019ll talk about that and more\u2026 but first: former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. ", "Story Continued Below", " I\u2019m former congresswoman Pat Schroeder. I was on the Armed Services Committee for all 24 years I was in Congress. So I saw lots of women have all sorts of problems.", "Well, that\u2019s right and especially in this national security world, as we were talking about, women are a minority of a minority and have been for a long time. So you have the broader problems of the political world that you operated in and of course, Congress, which is not exactly a bastion of progressive thinking, either, then or now. But then how does the national security space specifically do you think differ from those other areas?", "Well, first of all, it\u2019s been a very hard, hard pull for these young lionesses. I was the one who pushed to get them into the different academies, which people didn\u2019t want to do, and obviously, those are their sacred spots and worked very hard to try and get them to have all sorts of slots. I\u2019m a pilot, so I couldn\u2019t see any reason they couldn\u2019t fly and there isn\u2019t any reason they can\u2019t fly. They deal with gravity better than men. That\u2019s a dirty old secret but nevertheless, same with getting them into space. They didn\u2019t want to send them into space. They didn\u2019t want to send them anywhere and I had all sorts of horrible experiences coming from Colorado. The speaker put me on the board of overseers at the Air Force Academy. And the Air Force Academy is probably the most advanced of the services, anyway. So they invited me out, land at the Air Force Academy, drags in these young men and he sits there like this and he says, \u201cTell this woman what you think of her idea to let girls in here.\u201d", "\u201cGo ahead, speak freely.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it might be better if you left.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. Speak freely in front of me. Go ahead, tell them.\u201d So obviously, even the young men knew that all the way through the top command, this was something we imposed on them. This was like some kind of an experiment or some terrible thing. And it was interesting because the young man would say things like, \u201cWell, they could wear their hair long.\u201d And I\u2019d say, \u201cDo you want to wear your hair longer?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDoes it interfere with the mission?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, they can wear earrings. Does it interfere with the mission? Do you want to wear it here?\u201d We would just go on and on and they couldn\u2019t\u2014", " And this was in the 1980s? ", " Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So this was right before we finally got permission to get them into the academies. So then, one of the things that really troubled me was we did get them in the academies and the Air Force Academy asked that I not be put back on the board. They really were not fond of my term.", " Were there other women on the board?", " No, no. And so then I start watching what\u2019s happening to this incoming class and they\u2019re all suffering from amenorrhea. And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh, my goodness, this did not happen when they desegregated Harvard and Yale. So the pressure must be horrendous and you begin to think, \u201cOh, gracious.\u201d ", "And my favorite story just to end on the Air Force Academy is I\u2019m on the floor one day and I get this call, \u201cGo talk to colonel so-and-so from the Air Force Academy.\u201d I get on the phone in a cloakroom and he says, \u201cDamn you. It finally happened. We knew it would happen.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, could you back up and tell me what \u2018it\u2019 is?\u201d \u201cA cadet six months pregnant. We\u2019ve thrown her out.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, well, was there anyone else implicated?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cNo, none of the males are implicated.\u201d And I said, \u201cWould you please look out the window? Is there a star over the Air Force Academy? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this in several thousand years.\u201d", "Well, he threw the phone down and that was the end of it. So they never thought I was very funny. But that type of tension was just incredible that these young lionesses went through. You saw it also, the harassment that you got, Tailhook being one of the many things. I got very involved in the Tailhook thing because there was this one wonderful young woman finally willing to come forward. And as the military women would tell me on the side, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know our options. We know our options stink. Oh, yeah. We could go report it. Who do you report it to? The head of your command, he may be the one harassing you or he may be the one who thinks it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d So where do you go with these stories? And this young woman\u2019s father and grandfather had both been in the Navy and they were like, \u201cNavy men aren\u2019t to act that way and we\u2019re going to stand behind you,\u201d and took on the whole Tailhook thing. Which was very brave of her. ", "This was in 1986?", " Right, and on and on it went. But the Tailhook thing had been running for years with huge numbers of women being assaulted, not just military women. Anybody that happened to be walking through that hallway.", "Did things get better as a result of all the attention to Tailhook? One thing that depressingly is striking to me is that we have had these repeated public moments of scandal around sexual harassment. There was Tailhook and then there was Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. There have been just in the last few years in the media, these enormous stories about Bill Cosby and O\u2019Reilly and the like and yet, it\u2019s not clear to me that these have been anything other than sort of episodic moments. ", " Well, and the hope that so many of us had would be that the younger generation, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem and then suddenly, you read all about what\u2019s going on out in Silicon Valley, which would tend to be younger. So you take deep breaths and say, \u201cHow do we keep working on this?\u201d I think eventually, a lot of the women have really shown their courage in all of this and eventually, it starts to change. But there was such a feeling of, \u201cWe don\u2019t want women.\u201d One of the most surprising things that ever happened to me as I was doing a morning show on ABC where I was talking about getting women into all of the slots that they qualified for. ", "And when I got done, the cameraman came from behind the camera and starts beating me up, and I\u2019m like\u2014well, they pulled him off. And the powers that be said, \u201cOh, my gosh. He\u2019s six months from retirement.\u201d ", "You mean he was yelling at you and\u2014", " Oh, he was hitting me, yes.", "He was actually hitting you? He was actually\u2014", "He didn\u2019t hurt me because people immediately grabbed him, but\u2014", " Here in Washington? ", "Here in Washington at the ABC bureau down there across from the Mayflower Hotel and I was like, \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t do anything. I do not want to be the one that keeps him from his retirement six months from now, for crying out loud.\u201d But to think that that so rankled him what I was saying about women being able to contribute is amazing. I think we also don\u2019t know the history of women. I kept saying to people, \u201cDo you know that there are women soldiers buried\u2014Revolutionary soldiers buried at West Point?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, they cross-dressed and you know what? When they were discovered, Washington insisted they be paid the same because they fought the same.\u201d", " Can I ask you about the response in the political and national security establishment? So a lot of this activism that you were undertaking on behalf of getting women into positions in the military, getting women into positions in our national security establishment. It was occurring in the 1980s and the 1990s when there\u2019s first two Republican presidents and a Democratic president. That power establishment, how resistant were they? How much did women who entered that world find it welcoming or not? People say, \u201cOh, well, there was Jeane Kirkpatrick in the Reagan administration.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine that she was really partnering with you on these issues.", "No. It was fairly lonely. I found that a lot of women in the women\u2019s movement, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the military, their response was, \u201cWhy do you want women in the military anyway? We\u2019re for peace.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m for peace, too, but there are people who want to make this their career and I think they might make it a better military if they were in it.\u201d So we were having a big fight with Bella Abzug", "about it. \u201cWhy do you keep pressing away on this? Why don\u2019t we work over here in this area?\u201d", "But that was a key point, actually. Because I think that probably went on for a long time and it explains why even those women who did enter national security didn\u2019t necessarily have the same infrastructure of support.", "They didn\u2019t. They absolutely didn\u2019t and don\u2019t let anyone tell you they did because I kept trying to get it and you can\u2019t think of a women\u2019s convention where this really came up. It was always like, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll get to it but we\u2019re really not for that.\u201d ", "What about the nexus between sex and sexual harassment and the institutionalized sexism and gender discrimination, right? We all understand there is a connection here. But in some ways, we tend to treat these as separate problems. How much, once you got women into these academies, once you fought to get them into positions, did you immediately then begin hearing from them about incidents of sexual harassment or outright sexual assault? ", " Well, I did from a lot of them and I think one of the interesting things that when the U.N. had that International Year of the Woman, there was a Dr. Elise Boulding who did this very interesting study and I think she was absolutely right. She talked about you can\u2019t really change an institution until you have a critical mass of women. This idea that you put one woman on the board and everything will change. No.", "The tipping point.", "Exactly, you put one woman and everything\u2019s going to\u2014no, no, no. And it\u2019s not like two are going to do it, either. You\u2019ve got to have a critical mass. So clearly, with women going into the military, we\u2019re nowhere near a critical mass nor any of these schools and we\u2019re dealing with the same people who fought violently not to let them in. The second thing is if you go back and look, DOD, they studied women in the military more than any other group that\u2019s ever come into the military and they always did very well. In fact, they did wonderfully well. So they never knew what to do. It was like, \u201cDamn. Well, we\u2019ll study again next year. Maybe it will come out worse next year.\u201d ", "They used to say, \u201cWell, women will get pregnant. They\u2019re going to miss a lot of time and on and on and on.\u201d They found that what often happened was that young men would be involved in motorcycle accidents and so forth and so on and actually, young men were missing more days than young women. So no matter where you looked at it, they couldn\u2019t find a way to get rid of them. ", " That\u2019s a good way of putting it. Do you have any specific memories of any women that you connected with who brought their stories of harassment to you or that you tried to intervene on their behalf?", " Oh, yes. I worked obviously, with the young woman on Tailhook who brought hers. I had then lots of different instances. One of my favorite\u2014Carter, I believe, put in the first woman secretary of the Air Force. And I had an Air Force installation in my district then I came home one weekend and this group of young women came and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all junior officers and we\u2019re supposed to go to the officers club\u201d\u2014because that\u2019s where you get your credentials and you schmooze. \u201cBut they keep having these topless go-go dancers and everything there.\u201d ", "At the officers club?", "At the officers club and it\u2019s really hard. So I said, \u201cOh, my god. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d So I get a hold of my friend who is secretary of the Air Force and she says, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m putting an order out immediately.\u201d So I think I\u2019m probably the smartest person on the planet and I\u2019ve solved this, bam, bam, which you almost never do. About six months later, they come back to the office and they say, \u201cI thought you were going to fix this. What\u2019s happened?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s happened?\u201d I call my friend, the secretary, and she says-- she convenes all of the people around her, all the uniform guys and she said, \u201cWhat happened to that order?\u201d And they said, \u201cOh, we thought you were kidding.\u201d They didn\u2019t send it out. Well, they did then. That was the end of it. ", "But that tells you how entrenched it was in their thinking, that, \u201cOh, she must be kidding. She certainly wouldn\u2019t expect us to take out the topless go-go dancers in the officers club.\u201d Glasser: How did they feel about you in this activism on the Armed Services Committee? ", "Oh, they didn\u2019t like it at all.", "Were there other women on the committee at that time?", "Yeah. The first year I was there, the Republicans put on a woman, Marjorie Holt. ", "And then, later on, several other women came on. Actually, I don\u2019t think we ever had more than three. But no, I think they all thought I was nuts. \u201cWhy are you causing all this trouble?\u201d It was always, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing the important things?\u201d And I would be like, \u201cAnd what are they?\u201d \u201cOh, well, how many carriers we should have.\u201d And I would go, \u201cI think I could do both.\u201d ", "Was there a big change with the Clinton Administration coming in? ", "Well, they certainly appointed a lot more women at the top. That really helped. I think of the bit, if they put out an order, they thought it was kidding. That ended. They believed it. Yeah, I think it really begins to help and you also had a couple of classes from these different academies graduating and moving into the mainstream. The other thing I found that really started to make a difference was some of these admirals and generals and everything, their daughters decided they wanted to go to the Academy or they wanted to be in the military. And I remember one admiral who just fought me tooth and nail about women on ships. \u201cOh, no. You can\u2019t have women on ships. No. It\u2019s a tight quarter. Oh, my God. The sex, it will be awful.\u201d And I kept saying to him, they have coed dorms at places and this all works out. ", "And let me tell you how they have locks on the door. Anyway, so one year, he comes for the presentation at the beginning, and all of a sudden, he\u2019s for women on ships. And I thought, \u201cWell, do I embarrass him in front of everybody and say, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d So afterward, I go in the cloakroom and I said to him, \u201cI think this was a change in your position. Am I correct?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, you got me.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, my daughter went into the DC PD, the Washington Police Department. She\u2019d be so much safer on a ship.\u201d And I got to rethinking all of this, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, is that what it takes?\u201d ", "The ultimate politics is personal, right? Well, I know you have to run but I\u2019m also asking everybody if they have any sort of \u201cMe Too\u201d story of their own to share with all those. In your long career in politics, did anyone ever grab you and kiss you? Did anyone ever\u2014", "Well, of course, I think everybody\u2019s got stories about wonderful Strom Thurmond because he was older and he could get away with it, you know?", "Well, you saw what happened to former President George H.W. Bush, though. To me, that was that Thurmond-like behavior, right? So did you get your butt pinched by Strom Thurmond? ", " I think everybody did. But most of them stayed away because I was fairly clear where I was. I was the dragon lady. They weren\u2019t going to deal with\u2014", "Right, in public? Absolutely.", " But there were some women members who did have trouble with others. ", " Did you feel like they saw you and other women as a support group up on the Hill?", "They thought we should be cheerleaders, in many instances, for what they were. There were some that were very good. You always hate to talk in a big generality, but there were some that didn\u2019t get it and probably still don\u2019t get. And who knows what will happen. Look at this week where Congressman Tim Murphy has to resign because while he\u2019s terribly anti-abortion, he has his mistress get an abortion. I mean, really? ", " That sounds like the Congress you remember well from the 1980s, doesn\u2019t it? ", " I do and it\u2019s unfortunately 2017. Oh, there used to be that joke in the cloakroom people would be talking about. \u201cWell, how about the abortion bill?\u201d And the guy would say, \u201cYeah, I paid mine.\u201d Oh, really? Funny.", "They used to say that in the cloakroom? Amazing. ", " Not all of them, but some. ", "Well, I have to say it\u2019s been a real honor to have a chance to talk with former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, who was a legendary figure when I first came to Washington, when I graduated from college and started working here as a reporter and I think we often lose the context and the history of how long we\u2019ve been talking about things like this. So for me, it\u2019s particularly valuable, I think, to hear your voice as part of this.", ": Thank you.", "Thank you and welcome back to Washington.", "***", "Hi, I\u2019m Susan Glasser, and welcome back to The ", ". It\u2019s my great honor to be joined for this part of our conversation in our special episode of The ", " and the ", " podcast with Deborah James, who was the second woman to serve as secretary of the Air Force. Thank you so much for joining us today.", " Thank you, Susan.", "Well, this is really\u2014I\u2019m just overwhelmed by all of the thoughtful reflection and conversation, and national conversation, really, that has been spurred over the last few weeks by these revelations about Harvey Weinstein, about powerful figures in the media. Just the other day, we had the British minister of defense resigning after he was faced with public accusations of harassment, and said he couldn\u2019t be sure there wouldn\u2019t be more coming out. ", "My guess is, on some level, none of this is a surprise to you. You\u2019ve been living with it privately and professionally for a long time, seeing this play out. But the public aspect of it might be a little bit of a stunner. How has this national conversation impacted you? What have you been thinking about?", "Well, on the one hand, it\u2019s a shame that we continue to have episodes like this, and we really have had, as you point out, a rash of episodes, a rash of revelations in recent weeks and months. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not all that much of a surprise to me. I think this issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, it has been with us for a long period of time. It\u2019s been with us forever, and the more that we talk about it, I think the more possibility of this really being a game-changing moment in history, where maybe we can get on a different trajectory.", "But, on the other hand, I\u2019ve been around enough, scandals happen, things get publicized, everyone rushes to the scandal, but eventually, something else overtakes the public discourse, and we forget. And then we have to repeat when another scandal erupts. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen to us again. I hope real change can be forthcoming.", " Well, it\u2019s interesting that you raise that. I think there are so many smart women I\u2019ve spoken with, especially in the national security space, and they\u2019re on the one hand feeling it\u2019s about time to have this national conversation but it is definitely tempered by a concern that we\u2019ve been through not one, but many scandals before without it changing many of the structural issues. And I was struck by how many scandals didn\u2019t turn into a national conversation, including ones that you yourself oversaw disciplinary action in.", "Just a few months ago, you were then at that time still the secretary of the Air Force. There was an Air Force action that you participated in which you stripped a retired four-star general of two ranks and docked him about $60,000 per year in pension payments after determining that he had coerced sex with a subordinate officer three times and told her that he would\u2014quote\u2014deny it until the day he died. I\u2019m reading from a USA Today story.", "You know, I was so impressed, on the one hand with how you handled that. You wrote: \u201cYou are hereby reprimanded!\u201d in exclamation points on December 6, 2016. \u201cYour conduct is disgraceful, and but for the statute of limitations bar to prosecution, would be more appropriately addressed through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\u201d", "But there was no big national outcry around this. Tell us about that case and others that you handled as the secretary, and what it tells you about our overall state of willingness to address sexual misconduct.", " That case, I believe, was one of the most senior uniformed military officers who was ever disciplined. That case was a retired four-star general from the Air Force, as you point out. I think the higher you are in a leadership position, whether you\u2019re in the uniform military, whether you\u2019re in the civilian part of government, whether you\u2019re in business, whatever your industry may be, you\u2019re in a special position of trust. And so, you all the more have to adhere to the rules, have to demonstrate dignity and respect to all.", "So, in this case the victim came forward years after the fact, and indeed, as you pointed out, there had been statute of limitation issues, which essentially made the Uniform Code of Military Justice not workable in this case. And so we went through the whole process. ", "There was a significant investigation. A lot of time and effort went into it. It was fully coordinated. I heard all the viewpoints, including from the accused, as well as from the victim, and at the end of the day I made the decision to hold this person accountable the best way I could with the tools that I still had left in my toolbox.", "Again, the higher you are, the greater position of trust that you are privileged to serve in, and if you misuse that trust there needs to be accountability.", "What do you think, and what did you learn in the course of this case and others that you were privy to as secretary? What did you learn about the culture inside the Pentagon and inside the U.S. military when it comes to questions around abuse of power and sexual coercion? We all know intuitively that there have been scandals inside the uniform military. How does it connect with our broader national security conversation?", " Well, I\u2019m not so sure there are more scandals within the uniform military than there are in many other walks of life in the United States, and indeed, around the world. I\u2019m not necessarily convinced of that, but of course, my life\u2019s work has been focused on the military and national security.", " And women are very underrepresented in senior positions in all of these places.", "Women are underrepresented. If you go way back in my personal career, I started early on, on Capitol Hill for the House Armed Services Committee, and at the time I joined the professional staff, there was only one or two at best other women who were professional staff members. So, I was young and I was one of a very few in that type of a national security job. ", "I went on to the Pentagon, and was an assistant secretary of defense when I was in my thirties. So once again, I was rather young; I was one of a few at that point. This was the \u201890s in the Clinton administration. And then most recently, I returned to government as the secretary of the Air Force.", "This was, of course, an even more senior job. There were more women in the environment, but still, underrepresented. And if you take that to the uniform military side, women have attained the highest ranks on both the enlisted and the officer side, but there are still not that many. It is still an underrepresented, even though we\u2019re 50 percent of the population.", "Well, so, let\u2019s talk about that. Yesterday we had this very frank conversation with some of your peers, or younger women who worked in the national security field, and we got very real; we got very personal. Like you, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ve all spent the last few weeks in a way excavating our own past, as well as looking at the broader policy discussion. ", "And, thinking about those things when we were young and coming up, especially when you were one of only one or two people on, say, the Armed Services Committee staff, what I was blown away by was every single person around the table had incidents that in hindsight, or in today\u2019s climate, would be viewed as harassment, or at the least, a hostile environment\u2014women changing their appearance, or saying, \u201cOh, gee, I can\u2019t wear skirts to the office. I\u2019m afraid of that assistant secretary.\u201d ", "Tell us a little bit about your own experience coming through a profession where there were so few other similarly-situated women. Did you ever feel those, or encounter those kind of incidents?", "When I was in my twenties and thirties, I did encounter some of those types of incidents. My incidents were more when I was on Capitol Hill as a young staffer, and into my early thirties. By the time I reached the Pentagon, I will say I did not encounter those instances, because by the time I reached the Pentagon, I myself was in a position of authority and power, and I was a bit older\u2014though I was still fairly young\u2014for that level of a job. ", "Youth is not always part of the explanation, but with youth usually comes a lack of authority, a lack of power, a lack of experience, and so people who are older, people who do have that authority and power, can fail in their own integrity, and take advantage of that, and they can press, and they can see what the traffic will bear, so to speak.", "And so I have my own stories of that, but they come more from Congress and they come more from my international travels when I was with the Congress. So, it\u2019s not just in the United States, as I said, you will encounter this all over the world. And I think young women\u2014young men, as well\u2014but, youth and a lack of power, it tends to happen more. Not exclusively, but more.", " Yes. We talked about that, that that is one of the things that makes this national security or foreign policy field different than women encounter these problems in every profession, but this is a specificity of our Washington world, which is traveling internationally to places that have even more problems with this. Several of the women recounted being afraid, literally afraid on some of these foreign trips where they\u2019re representing the United States, or the U.S. Congress, and they felt that they were potentially going to be preyed upon, or also felt a problem with members of Congress not wanting to travel with them, that it could affect their careers negatively. Did you ever experience that, this ceiling? I mean, now, people are afraid a little bit that there could be a backlash\u2014right?\u2014and that the response to, \u201cOh my goodness, there\u2019s all these accusations of sexual harassment. I shouldn\u2019t be alone with a woman,\u201d the Mike Pence rule.", " I never feared for my safety, per se, certainly not with any of the U.S. colleagues, be they superiors or peers of mine. I never feared for my safety, but I\u2019ve been in uncomfortable situations which I handled in my own way. What I never did then is what some of the women are now doing today. I never spoke out then. And this is why I say, at a level, or at a point in time where there really is this critical mass of women who are having the courage to come out and speak about these things, we have at least the potential to have this be a game-changing moment. ", "This has been going on for a long time, but to the extent people like me\u2014and I\u2019m complicit in this\u2014the fact that we said nothing, the fact that we dealt with it in our own way\u2014perhaps in retrospect that was wrong of us to do. But, as you point out, particularly when you\u2019re younger you don\u2019t know quite what to do. You just try to get through it. You don\u2019t succumb to it, hopefully, but you just carry forth and you do the best you can and you ignore it. That was the way I approached it, because I didn\u2019t want to be the one to make an accusation and possibly have it blow back on me, which is why this continues to be a very underreported crime and inappropriate types of behavior.", " You know, a couple weeks ago in this whole controversy\u2014I\u2019m sure you remember\u2014with White House chief of staff, General John Kelly, he was talking about the Gold Star families. And he made a point that I think caused a lot of women here in Washington to really do a double-take in the course of that, where he seemed to be bemoaning a past where he said women were \u201csacred.\u201d And a lot of people were surprised by that comment, thinking that the good old days maybe weren\u2019t so good for women.", "But I\u2019m wondering, was that attitude prevalent in the Pentagon at the upper levels? You know, it has historically been a somewhat isolated and insulated male-dominated, warrior culture.", "In the Air Force, in the area that I focused on most recently in government, I didn\u2019t hear talk like this. As a matter of fact, we\u2014during the period that I served\u2014opened up the remaining, that previously had been closed, jobs to women. Now, the Air Force had always been the most open service; it was a little bit more difficult for the Marine Corps, and, of course, Kelly is a Marine retired general. It was a little bit more difficult for the Army. It was probably the easiest for the Air Force to open up those remaining jobs.", "But if you go back in time, in the 1990s, for example, I was in the Pentagon at the time that we collectively opened up combat aircraft to women, and combat naval vessels to women, as well. That was much more I would say gut-wrenching from my memories. So, the leaders of that era, who were at that time four-star generals, were much more of the ilk of, say, my father, the type of thing that my father would say, and my father might have said something like, \u201cWomen are sacred.\u201d My father\u2014God rest his soul\u2014was born in the year 1923. ", "So, this is also a generational thing. And it is my hope that the more that we bring women into these different types of specialties, and particularly if we can reach a critical mass\u2014not just a handful, but a critical mass of women, and men see that they\u2019re doing the job\u2014these attitudes will change. ", "Were there things that you tried to do that you were surprised or frustrated that you couldn\u2019t get done when it came to empowering women more within the military?", " As the secretary of a military service, we are privileged when we are in these jobs to be able to give out promotion instructions to promotion boards. And these are portrayed as your individual instructions. But with that said, there are a lot of parameters. And I had hoped to be able to put more about the importance of diversity and inclusion into those promotion instructions to try to bring up more people of diverse backgrounds and diverse ethnicities, and gender, and so on. I had hoped to put more in those promotion instructions, but found that I was legally constrained and that it was really quite modest, what I was able to do. So that was a bit of a surprise. I thought I would have more leeway than I did.", "What was not surprising\u2014and again, this is what gives me hope for the future\u2014is the senior male leaders in the Air Force of today were very embracing of these initiatives, of the thrust of wanting to work on this more. Because, guess what? We\u2019re all in a war for talent, and if 50 percent of the population of young people that you\u2019re trying to draw from is female, then why wouldn\u2019t you want to get your fair share of that fantastic talent in the front door?", "So, they get that part. That\u2019s the business imperative, I\u2019ll say, for the Air Force. And so, I think it is different today. We have come a long way, but there still is a long way yet to go.", " Well, that\u2019s a good summation of it. One of the things that came up repeatedly in our group conversation was the question of whether women in national security face the added almost public burden of our very image of what a guardian of national security looks like, right? Why does Donald Trump appoint so many generals? He calls them \u201cmy generals.\u201d Because they fit the suit\u2014you know, this notion that we have to have a sort of big, burly, retired three- or four-star general communicating to us about our defense policies and national security.", "How much do you think our notion of guardianship and of national security is still tied up with images of men?", "Probably a great deal. And when you speak about command of troops\u2014I mean, that is very, very still heavily commanded by men. I mean, women who have come up through the ranks and been at the senior-most positions in the military have tended to be more in the acquisition field; they\u2019ve been medical corps; they\u2019ve been things other than combat-oriented command of troops. That\u2019s changing gradually, but very gradually.", "Right. And if you need to be a combat commander in order to then rise up to the very top\u2014right\u2014", "You had to have checked all the boxes along the way for promotions and so on. But one example that we\u2019re all very proud of is General Lori Robinson, who is the first combatant commander. She is the commander of Northern Command, so she\u2019s responsible for the defense of the United States, as well as the entirety of North America. So, she is a combatant commander and she is a first. ", "So, that\u2019s an example of how things have slowly changed for women to be able to command troops. As the secretary of a service, I liken the job to more being the CEO of the enterprise, so it\u2019s a question of budget, it\u2019s talent management. It\u2019s a question of training and investments for technology, and procurement, and so on. But what I always tell women about matters of appearance is, be who you are, play to your own strengths. Don\u2019t try to outdo somebody else who has strengths that you don\u2019t have.", "So, for example, I was never a combat pilot, so I never attempted to outdo the combat pilot on matters of piloting a combat aircraft, if you see what I mean. But I did know a lot about business. I knew a lot about the Congress, budgets, talent management\u2014so you\u2019ve got to play to your strength, and there\u2019s where you need to also have a team of people around you who can complement you where you\u2019re not as strong.", "Looking back 20, 25, 30 years ago, when you were a young staffer starting out on the House Armed Services Committee, what would you tell your 20-something, 30-something self now, when it comes to these issues of gender in the workplace and sexual harassment?", "I would tell my 20-something self in certain ways to do exactly what you did, which is dream big, aspire high, go for it. But I think I would also tell my 20-something-year-old self, speak up more. When you see things that aren\u2019t appropriate or when something happens to you that is not appropriate, speak up. Don\u2019t be fearful; speak up. Take that chance. And I would like to think that I might do that. ", "But again, when I was in my early twenties, I, too, had a certain fear about speaking up, and didn\u2019t want to make waves. And that\u2019s another thing. It\u2019s this bystander complex. So, whether we\u2019re a woman or we\u2019re a man, if we\u2019re in an environment and we see things going south quickly, if we see inappropriate jokes, inappropriate touching, anything of this nature, to the extent we stand by and let it happen, or worse yet, if we giggle along with the joke, that\u2019s real bad. And all of us who care about this issue need to stop doing that to the extent that we have done it. ", "So, it\u2019s not just if it happens to you, but if you are in the environment and you see it happening, take a stand. Say something.", " I\u2019m sure you must have known men who have been accused of things like this, or where this happened firsthand to you, and going back and thinking about that is a very complicated and painful thing, right? You don\u2019t get to go back 20 years in time.", " You don\u2019t get to go back, but again, I will say, in the spectrum of things that could happen to a person, I didn\u2019t have the worst end of the spectrum happen to me. And so, through the years it has not been something that has deeply troubled me, that I\u2019ve had difficulty getting beyond, so to speak. ", "But this is a moment in time when we\u2019re reflecting, because it is so much in the headlines, and there are so many prominent people now who we now know have really engaged in some pretty predatory behavior. So, I think at a moment like this it makes somebody like me\u2014and perhaps like some of the other women you\u2019re speaking with\u2014reflect back to some of the things that happened to us, or that happened to our peers, that we either knew about or should have known about, and how did we react? And how might we recommend to our own daughters, our own sons, other young people in our midst\u2014what would we recommend today? And I know I would recommend speak up.", "Secretary Deborah James, second woman secretary of the Air Force and our guest this week on The ", ".

And if that were to happen\u2014and let\u2019s just say for the sake of discussion there were an impeachment, even less likely a conviction\u2014all that would serve to do is heighten the polarization and the divisiveness, because the base will never accept that, and that would just feed the conspiracy theories.\u201d ", "In the end, he is still more intelligence analyst than advocate. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Clapper concluded, \u201cthat an outcome like that\u2014the president\u2019s removal\u2014would be a good thing.\u201d", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    Updated ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                                ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

", "And yet, throughout that, the consistency with which we have talked about Russia\u2014not only, of course, because I was a former correspondent in Moscow\u2014but because it has been a theme in many ways, both of the politics of the Trump administration, with the Russiagate investigation still underway, but also because it has remained the most perplexing foreign policy question. Donald Trump to this day has never personally moved beyond his public admiration for Vladimir Putin, his praise for him, and yet his administration has talked tough, has really undertaken a policy toward Russia that isn\u2019t all that different from what a Democratic or a Republican administration might do, faced with the same set of facts. ", "So the conundrum of trying to understand what the heck is going on with Russia has remained this enduring obsession. So we\u2019ve had many great episodes about Russia. We\u2019ll talk about some of those today, some of the highlights, and Julia and I will try to make sense of it. ", " One of the things\u2014right, Julia\u2014that from the beginning has been so weird about Trump and Russia is that on one hand, Washington has never been more obsessed with Russia in some ways, and yet, it\u2019s very ignorant about Russia, too. ", "So how do you square that circle? You were born in Russia. You emigrated here. You then returned after you graduated from college as a working journalist to Moscow.", "To work for you at ", " ", ".", " And then you came back here to Washington. So, we are kind of unusual in that we both have covered both Washington and Moscow. That\u2019s not true of all that many people. What do you make of Washington\u2019s Russia obsession these days?", "Well, personally, I find it deeply frustrating. It\u2019s one of those cases where what are we talking about when we talk about Russia? And usually, the answer is not Russia, but we\u2019re talking about ourselves in the same way that when Russians obsess about America; they\u2019re not really obsessing about America, they\u2019re obsessing about themselves but refracted through this external lens.", "And it\u2019s funny to see this country described as this kind of Bondian nexus of evil where everything is super-organized, Putin is this master strategist who just has everything planned out from A to Z, and is able to follow through piece by piece on his strategy or on his agenda, and that everything is just\u2014I mean, it\u2019s basically the Soviet Union mixed with ", " mixed with some James Bond. ", "And I don\u2019t know about you\u2014you spent a lot of time there, too\u2014I don\u2019t recognize that Russia, you know. The Russia I know is a lot more like ", ", mixed with some James Bond stuff, right? It\u2019s a lot of things. And I think I sometimes overcompensate in the other direction, where I\u2019m like, you guys are just not that good. They\u2019re not that competent. ", "Well, this is a great starting point, actually, for our first segment of our conversation today, which is about the Russia as it actually is, and what do we really think about Vladimir Putin now that he has just gotten another six-year term? He\u2019s already been in power for 18 years. He\u2019s already, in fact, become the longest-serving Russian leader since Josef Stalin. ", "Here, in the West, the impression that people have is that Putin runs the whole country. This is not so, at all.", "\u2026people so easily accept this myth about this great and horrible Putin.", "I was in Russia a few months ago talking to Russians, both those who I would say are more supportive of the government and those who aren\u2019t. And all of them, to a man and woman, said, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand why you Americans are so obsessed with what Russia may or may not have done.\u201d They said, \u201cYou\u2019ve now made us into this colossus, as if we kind of control what\u2019s happening in the United States. You\u2019re really attributing to our leadership, to the Kremlin, to Putin, whatever, much greater power than we think they have.\u201d\u2026 So there\u2019s a real puzzlement there about the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.", "So I picked out a few of our interviews over the last year on The Global Politico", "that really go to this question of, are we really talking about Russia as it actually exists today? And it was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Russian wealthiest man\u2014he was then imprisoned by Vladimir Putin\u2014now a dissident who lives in London. He called it this \u201cmyth of the great and horrible Putin.\u201d", " Which is so interesting because he lost a decade of his life to this horrible Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin was, in fact, very horrible to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Vladimir Putin is horrible in a lot of ways, but here if you read the discussion or you listen to the discussion about Russia, you\u2019re not hearing about those ways. And, again, I think as you and I have talked about a lot, it\u2019s a lot about how we imagine our adversary as Americans; and for somebody to be able to come in and mess with our elections, or to stymie us in geopolitics and take over our traditional kind of\u2014I hate to use this term\u2014spheres of influence, they have to be a really mighty enemy, right? ", "They have to be really, really good. Otherwise are we not very good if we\u2019re stymied by some kind of tin-pot dictator, banana republic, where things are kind of held together with shoelaces and gum?", "Well, one of the things that you pointed out already that I think really drives a lot of this is that Americans tend to forget that while it\u2019s an authoritarian political system, it\u2019s still a political system, and Vladimir Putin is often responding to his internal need to maintain himself and his government and his regime in power, and there\u2019s another clip from Khodorkovsky where he made that point, where he said, Look, this is Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign platform, America-bashing. When he\u2019s fighting in Syria; when he\u2019s fighting in Ukraine\u2014he\u2019s fighting against the big bad West. It\u2019s a war between Russia and the West; it\u2019s not a war between Russians and Ukrainians.", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a very key thing to understand. When you\u2019re in Russia, what you hear about is, did Putin do this for external consumption or internal consumption? And a lot of I think what we don\u2019t understand is that a lot of times the song is not about us. A lot of times it\u2019s done for an internal audience, to shore up his domestic support. I mean, I think it\u2019s really telling that much of the Russian news today is not really about what\u2019s happening in Russia, not about a stagnant economy, not about corruption, not about rotten infrastructure. It\u2019s about the West, or about Russia\u2019s exploits abroad. ", "And it\u2019s about this bait-and-switch of\u2014you know, Putin\u2019s original contract with the Russian people was, you guys get wealthy or you become better off; I\u2019ll help you do that, but you in return, you stay out of politics, and you leave that to me.", "I called that his Make Russia Great Again strategy.", " Right. And then, when he returned to power in 2012, widely seen as an illegitimate return to power for his third term as president, he took on a more ideological, more revanchist kind of approach, and it became about, the economy\u2019s not doing great, but that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019re an empire again; we\u2019re great again. We are challenging the West; we are not dancing to their tune. We are not being humiliated by them and told what to do.", "And it\u2019s amazing how much it really resonates with Russians, how much it\u2019s important to them, the same way it\u2019s important to Americans to live in a great power.", "Well, and it\u2019s interesting because that was a theme of Vladimir Putin from the very beginning. So, I was there in Moscow for the first four years, basically, of Putin\u2019s presidency, when he certainly didn\u2019t have the international capabilities that he has now to basically intervene in the war in Syria, to intervene and to create a civil war on the ground in Ukraine. Back in the early 2000s, Russia really was much more of a basket case. In fact, people were still debating over, could they repay the Soviet debt in time. People were still debating over what kind of identity Putin would bring to the office of the president. ", "Well, again, it was an identity crisis, basically. We weren\u2019t sure what had happened in the first 10 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but we were pretty sure we didn\u2019t like it. And Putin came in and he played off of those feelings of insecurity and instability on the part of the Russian people. He said things are going to be stable again. But the thing that I remember so vividly that\u2019s relevant to today\u2019s conversation was that at the beginning Putin really was about restoring the Russian state internally, rebuilding power in the Kremlin. He used to call it the vertical of ", "\u2014basically, the vertical of power. And looking internally, consolidating authority; eliminating the democracy that had taken hold, if tenuously, in the first 10 years.", " Getting the oligarchs under control.", " Absolutely. Bring oligarchs under control; bring the media under control. So that was the story of the four-year period when I was there. I think what we missed, or that Putin wasn\u2019t yet ready for, was this much more internationally aggressive leader that we have today. He\u2019s now taken over Crimea\u2014that was the first armed annexation of territory since the end of World War II. ", "So, my question to you is, going forward, do you believe that now that Putin has another six-year term under his belt, is he going to be more aggressive again, internationally? Is he going to aggressively seek to revise international borders, to challenge the United States and the West elsewhere?", "I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes. I remember in 2012-2013 when the Russian economy started its kind of long decline, Russians who were very smart watching what was happening and very in tune with what has happening politically were saying, as Russia gets poorer internally, it\u2019s going to become more aggressive externally. ", "And I think that has very much been borne out since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine. Then you have Syria; you have the meddling in elections all over Europe and in the U.S., most recently being the Catalan independence movement. So, there\u2019s no referendum issue too small for Putin to get his hands in and try to kind of chip away at the transatlantic alliance, or order. ", "I think Syria and the Middle East are going to be a very interesting area to watch. Russia is now heading up the peace talks in Syria, bringing both the Turks and the Iranians to the table. America is not in those conversations at all anymore. We used to be helping to run the Geneva talks; now they\u2019ve been moved to Astana in Central Asia, in a former Soviet republic. ", "Russia talks to all sides. In the Middle East, it\u2019s seen now\u2014instead of the U.S., it\u2019s seen as the kind of reliable ally. ", "And by the way, just this week, I should point out, you have this incredible visual image of Donald Trump saying on the one hand, \u201cI want to get out of Syria immediately, as soon as possible,\u201d never mind what his advisers said or what the American policy has been. The same day, you have this incredible visual of Vladimir Putin convening regional leaders. To me, that was almost the visual representation of the post-American world order.", " Absolutely. And it\u2019s also kind of an embodiment of what Vladimir Putin wants to be and how he wants to be seen, both domestically and abroad. He wants to be seen as the great diplomat and peacemaker, and also aggressor. So, somebody who is really good with all the tools in that toolbox, that he can go to war if necessary and push back, but he is primarily the only adult in the room. ", "He\u2019s not going to start crazy, stupid wars like the Americans did in Iraq, which is constantly brought up by the Russians, when they admonished the Americans. He can convene all sides and be seen as an honest broker who actually follows through. ", " So, I think this notion of Vladimir Putin exactly as he wants to be seen is a great pivot to how he is seen in the United States today, and this Russiagate investigation. Because we\u2019re talking about Russia right now, but an awful lot of what passes for Russia conversation in Washington today, in American politics, is really not about Russia; it\u2019s about Russiagate, or whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s about the Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S. elections, the ongoing investigations of it by the Senate Intelligence Committee and, in particular, by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. ", "\"It was the hacking\u2026So, that\u2019s when the hairs really went up on the back of our necks. \u2026", "\u201cA lot of us had this Spidey sense and concerns all through \u201916 that the Russians were playing by a new playbook now, but we did not truly understand the totality of the effort\u2026\u2019", " \u201cIt\u2019s a failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11. Right? \u2026", "\u201cWe moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia. So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost.\u201d", "This, of course, from the very beginning of this Global Politico", "podcast has been a subject of ongoing and recurring conversations, both because it radically affects how Vladimir Putin is seen in the United States\u2014how does he want to be seen? Why did he intervene in our elections? Did he get what he wanted with Donald Trump? And then again, the seriousness of this investigation. We\u2019ve learned an awful lot in the course of the last year.", "When we started out at The Global Politico, we would have been astonished to know a lot of the information that has subsequently come out about contacts between the Trump campaign and various Russian envoys, emissaries, spies, and the like. We would be amazed to have learned, for example, about that summer 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Russians were openly promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to President Trump\u2019s own son and his top campaign officials. ", "So, let\u2019s talk Russiagate for a few minutes, and also what the Obama and Trump administrations did and didn\u2019t do about that. When I had Victoria Nuland on this show, she talked about the \u201cSpidey sense\u201d of the Russia experts inside the U.S. government, and how the hairs on the back of their necks were standing up when they started to realize in 2016 that Russia was running the same play inside the United States that it had run in many Eastern European countries already, intervening in their politics, and yet we didn\u2019t seem to recognize it. ", "So, I think\u2014again, this goes back to the idea of who is a worthy adversary to the U.S. I think the level of disbelief was also driven in fact by\u2014well, we\u2019re not Germany and we\u2019re not France and we\u2019re certainly not Hungary\u2014this can\u2019t happen here. And, in fact, it did. And as we\u2019re realizing also, with all the disclosures about Cambridge Analytica and the role that Facebook played, and earlier, the revelations about the role that Twitter played, and just the role of political advertising\u2014we\u2019re realizing that in some ways the Russians played the role of terrorists. They used our system, our own tools, against us. They were able to manipulate these openings on these platforms into pretty deft weapons.", " You know, I mean, I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because I\u2019ve been so struck by that. At the height of the Cold War, imagine that you told KGB agent Vladimir Putin or any of his bosses, \u201cAmerica itself is going to invent a tool by which you can have direct access to basically every single American\u2014certainly, every single American you\u2019d like to reach. It\u2019s basically going to be so cheap as to be free. And we will even sell you and help guide you to have the most effective use of this tool, and you will be able to\u2014", "And planting you\u2014", "Not only that, but we\u2019re going to tell you exactly what these Americans like; what they think about; who their friends are; and what kind of messages would most appeal to them. And American society will be so divided and fraught at the time that it\u2019ll be a total cakewalk to divide them further and to fan kind of the flames of division. Which is kind of how\u2014", " It would have been a KGB officer\u2019s dream.", " I mean, I\u2019ve spoken to former NSA head Michael Hayden about this, and he said, \u201cYou know, the best covert operations they don\u2019t create facts or divisions on the ground. They exacerbate the ones that are already there.\u201d And in some ways, 2016 was perfect. It was this kind of perfect storm, and the Russians just were able to push it in just the right direction. ", "I think what we still don\u2019t know\u2014to me, this is the most interesting question, and also the question that probably is completely unanswerable, is what impact did it have on the election? Did people stay home and not vote because they were Bernie supporters, and they were disgusted by what came out in the DNC hack? Did people come out and vote more for Trump because they saw these ads saying that Hillary was going to let in all these Muslims? Right? Or all these illegal immigrants.", "It\u2019s so hard to gauge, right, because everybody\u2019s decision to vote is so multifaceted and multifactorial. And that\u2019s, I think, part of the brilliance of this operation. And also because it was an operation that was, as one former Obama official said, was like throwing spaghetti at the wall. They were trying all kinds of different things, and I think this is what we also\u2014just going back to what we don\u2019t understand about the Russians\u2014we think of it as because the way we Americans would do it, we would have a clear hierarchy, a clear plan; there would be, kind of everybody would be unified in their mission and their idea of what everybody\u2019s doing. ", "But in fact, in Russia, one hand didn\u2019t know what the other hand was doing, and there was a lot of turf battles going on. As we now know from some terrific reporting from Russian reporters\u2014what\u2019s left of them\u2014and the fact that actually the Russians\u2019 strength was in their disorganization, in their flexibility, in their high appetite for risk, and the fact that they were willing to try crazy things and pivot as the situation merited. That that was actually their strength.", "Right, well, combined with the still unknown questions of how much help they received in targeting and distributing this information, either by the Trump campaign or those associated with it. And that, of course, is what still remains up in the air, and your point\u2014", "But also, the other thing is that that\u2019s also hard to determine, right? Even if they did have help from the Trump organization, and it seems that the Trump organization was happy to take help from anybody. The question is, was that the deciding factor? Or, because of the internet, in addition to, like if you went back to 1983 and talked to KGB agent Vladimir Putin, and you\u2019re like, on top of this tool they\u2019re going to call Facebook, they\u2019re also going to invent this thing called the internet, and they\u2019re going to put all their political information on line. You don\u2019t even need spies in Russia; they can just sit in Moscow\u2014", "Or St. Petersburg, with the Internet Research Agency.", " Right. And read the ", " and POLITICO and The Cook Political Report and watch all these TV channels through the internet. You don\u2019t even have to go there and flip sources, you know\u2014all this information about what districts to target, about what states are up in air, what issues are driving the conversation and are really pitting Americans against each other. It\u2019s just going to be\u2014you\u2019re just going to have this little screen, and it\u2019s going to be at your fingertips, literally. ", " No, that\u2019s exactly right. But we\u2019re still talking about the narrow question of the 2016 election and were votes swayed, and in some ways it\u2019s very unknowable. There\u2019s two other elements of this we haven\u2019t really talked about. ", "Number one, which is how much will it directly reach the level of criminal activity? How much will it directly reach the level\u2014", " And it already has, as we\u2019ve seen.", " Exactly. So, Mueller has already issued criminal indictments; there have already been guilty pleas in the case. But it still hasn\u2019t fundamentally yet answered the question of to what extent U.S. persons, and specifically those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself\u2014did they know about this, and were they involved in it? So, that\u2019s where we all sense there is a potential political explosion coming down the road.", "And then there\u2019s this question of: And so what? What is the United States supposed to do about this? And did the Obama administration handle it correctly? Was it proactive and aggressive enough in responding to it? And then of course, what\u2019s happened since then? You and I are talking on a day when there are a whole wave of new sanctions that have been finally released that target Putin\u2019s inner circle in response to this, but for God\u2019s sakes, we\u2019re talking about this is the spring of 2018, and this intervention occurred starting in late 2014, according to Bob Mueller.", " And, as some people have pointed out, by the time these sanctions came out, mostly against oligarchs, they have had plenty of time to restructure their assets in a way where they\u2019ll be minimally affected by the sanctions.", "Still, I think it\u2019s quite a strong signal, and I think the kind of underexplored and under-noticed area that I think a lot of this will come down to is the money aspect. You know, it\u2019s a truism in journalism, and it\u2019s truer than ever\u2014follow the money. And there was a story you and I talked about that came out last month on a weekend, pretty unnoticed, the Reuters investigation that rich Russians bought about $100 million of Trump property in south Florida alone. And this has been kind of bandied about on political talk shows here, about whether or not basically Donald Trump was essentially a laundromat for dirty Russian money because he didn\u2019t ask too many questions, and needed the money because American banks wouldn\u2019t lend to him.", "But, given how\u2014and this was one of the first ways that contemporary Russians took advantage of the American political system is, they make their money at home and then get it out of the country into the West, using all the things we invented almost for them. You know, LLCs, American law firms buying their property for them that are then protected by attorney-client privilege. You know, LLCs that buy LLCs that buy LLCs that buy some property in Trump Tower.", " Right. So you could never track it back.", " And if you don\u2019t have\u2014I\u2019ve been joking with some journalist friends that if I had a superpower I\u2019d want subpoena power, because otherwise it\u2019s really impossible to follow the money these days, and I think that\u2019s one of the avenues that is going to become more kind of fleshed out and filled in as the Mueller investigation continues, I hope, because I think there\u2019s going to be a lot there.", "So, one of the things since we\u2019ve been talking about Russia and the Russiagate investigation on The Global Politico", "one of the interesting things is that the politics surrounding it, on both right and left, have gotten scrambled, and you have this element of what I would call Muller-denialism that exists on the left as well as the right, people saying basically Russiagate is a distraction; it\u2019s not that serious; we shouldn\u2019t care about it; we should really focus either on the actual threats from Russia or on the problems of President Trump from the point of view of the left don\u2019t have to do with Russia; they have to do with what Trump is doing in the United States.", "Where do you come down on that debate, because it\u2019s a pretty fierce one already?", "Yes, and it has been from the moment it kind of broke. You know, I\u2019m kind of of two minds about it. I think that the debate around it has gotten so politicized and if you\u2019re in one camp you have to say and believe the following things, and if you\u2019re in the other you have to say and believe another set of facts, or beliefs. ", "And I think the problem lies in the fact that it has become about Trump, and Trump and Republicans feel this, and so they push back. They feel, maybe correctly, that this is Democrats kind of wanting a do-over, or at the very least, undermining Trump\u2019s legitimacy. And unfortunately, yes, it is about Trump, because it was an election in which he won in a really strange way. He lost the popular vote by a massive amount of votes and then squeaked through in these areas that were completely unexpected\u2014you know, they were the blue Democratic wall in the upper Midwest.", "So, it is about Trump, but I think the media and Democrats have\u2014and I hate to lump them together\u2014but, I think they have kind of failed to make the debate not about Trump, but about national security, about the integrity of our elections, about the fact that they\u2019ll do this to anybody, they\u2019ll do this to Republicans, too, if they find that they\u2019re being too hawkish on Russia, or if they want to just stir up more chaos.", "I remember watching the Roy Moore election in Alabama, and I just thought, this is so perfect, right? All of America is watching this race in Alabama, while Russia\u2019s just cleaning up in the Middle East, at very low cost, very low cost. Like, all of our fears of intervention in Syria, Russia has shown that you can do quite effectively with very few men on the ground and very little money, actually. So, and meddling in the Catalan independence movement. ", " Right. Still a distraction.", "Right. We just become\u2014because we\u2019re prone to it the same way the Russians are prone to it\u2014we\u2019re a big country with imperial ambitions and this kind of imperialness in our DNA the way that Russians are, and it\u2019s very easy for us to turn inward and become obsessed with our own internal struggles, and not notice that the Russian thief is out back cleaning out your chicken coop. I don\u2019t know where that analogy came from, but there it is.", "Well, all right. So, let\u2019s talk about Trump. It is about Trump. And I think that\u2019s sort of our third and final aspect of our conversation today, because you can\u2019t really talk about Russia and Trump without talking about what is inside his mind.

But, my goodness, that was back in January, February, of 2017. Here we are in April of 2018. Flash forward. Donald Trump has never to this day said something publicly critical of Vladimir Putin.", " As someone pointed out to me the other day, he is literally meaner to Meryl Streep than he is to Vladimir Putin, which is really quite something. And, on one hand I think Corker is absolutely right. I think he has an abiding fascination with and admiration for strongmen. He has been similarly kind to President Xi of China, Duterte of the Philippines, Erdogan of Turkey; he thinks that that\u2019s a good way to run a country, you know. He has attempted kind of a much paler version of what these guys do, of undermining the independent press. When SNL was mean to him in the very beginning of his administration, he publicly called into question NBC\u2019s broadcasting license. Very similar to those guys.", "That said, Erdogan, Xi, and Duterte did not intervene in the 2016 election with the overt goal of helping him win\u2014right? So, it becomes even more problematic that he won\u2019t say anything about Russia, especially because Russia continues to do crazy things.", "Well, there\u2019s also this striking\u2014call it a bifurcation, a split screen situation that\u2019s developed, where it\u2019s been one of the most revealing aspects of the gap between Donald Trump and Donald Trump\u2019s administration when it comes to foreign policy. And so you have this relatively hawkish foreign policy on Russia that\u2019s more or less supported by Democrats and Republicans. And you have the spectacle of the national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, before he was unceremoniously dumped by Trump. His last words out the door this week were a warning that the United States had failed to, in his view, adequately respond to the Russian provocations.", ": Or Rex Tillerson.

And I\u2019m just getting goosebumps thinking about it all over again, because it\u2019s just\u2026", "If you\u2019re a Russiagate skeptic, which I definitely was at the beginning, it\u2019s like there\u2019s increasingly less room for skepticism, because how do you explain that? It just\u2014even the optics of it are so bad, that he\u2019s pushed out everybody who\u2019s hawkish on Russia.

And the note said that the talking point said, \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d in capital letters. What does Trump do? He congratulates Putin.", "Not only that, but he invites him to the White House for a meeting.", "Well, then we find this out from the Russians.", " Right. And it\u2019s always\u2014", "We keep finding out\u2014the Russians are\u2014so, this is what I was getting to. Then Trump congratulates him. The talking points say, please scold him for the poisoning. He doesn\u2019t scold him. In fact, he invites him to a White House visit\u2014not just a visit. And the Russians are very ably playing off of this split. You know, he\u2019s basically given them a big opening to walk right into, and they\u2019re very ably playing the administration off the president that heads it to their own advantage, because the Russians, like the Chinese, love protocol. ", "All of these state visits are very important to them; the optics are very important to them, especially for Vladimir Putin, who wants to make Russia great again, who wants Russia to be seen as a peer to the U. S., and not as a junior partner in the relationship that is to be punished for things. What better image is there for him, after all of these diplomatic expulsions, after all of these sanctions, after\u2014again\u2014a poisoning on U.K. territory with a crazy nerve agent\u2014that he gets a photo op with the president of the U.S., in the White House that the president of the U.S. invited him to? But there is nothing more legitimizing than that, for the Russians. They\u2019re getting exactly what they want out of it.", "Even if the meeting never occurs, the timing of the leak, coming from the Russians, was very clearly weaponizing information that Trump himself had handed them. Why did they do it?", "It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve done it.", "And they did it to make it clear to people like us who are paying attention that Donald Trump is not on the same page with the tough policies coming out of his administration, number one. ", "Number two, that Donald Trump continues almost to this day to be privately acting in a very conciliatory fashion towards Vladimir Putin, and in fact, even seeking his approval. And Trump followed it up, by the way, rather than being ashamed or trying to hide this, what did Trump do? I think it\u2019s very notable that he spoke out publicly later and basically not only he confirmed it by saying, \u201cWell, yeah, shouldn\u2019t we get along with Russia?\u201d which is what he\u2019s been saying ever since the campaign.", " That\u2019s right. ", " He\u2019s never changed his rhetoric. If you actually look at what Trump himself is saying.", " It\u2019s one of the very few things on which he\u2019s been absolutely consistent. Last summer, when Congress passed\u2014this completely broken Congress passed with a veto-proof majority a mandate for new Russia sanctions, and Trump made several public statements about it saying he doesn\u2019t like this bill; he doesn\u2019t want to do sanctions against Russia. ", "The Russian political media made so much hay of it! I mean, all Russian politicians up and down the power vertical, all of Russian TV, was crowing about how the president of the U.S. wants to be friends, but the deep state is hamstringing him, and is just pointlessly against Russia, just irrationally against Russia.", " Well, this leads to the bigger-frame question. If we agree, as it seems that we do, that Trump has never wavered in either his admiration for Putin or desire somehow to reset relations, even though politically that\u2019s become very unrealistic, where does that leave the two countries? There\u2019s been this long debate that actually predates Donald Trump, but has certainly flared up anew since the election, over whether or not we are in a state of essentially a new Cold War with Russia. And everybody has a point of view on it. ", "I\u2019ve written a long piece about it. My basic takeaway is that the terminology isn\u2019t all that helpful because the first Cold War was plenty bad, and it existed in a totally different both media and information and military context, where there could be clear dividing lines between Russia and the West in a way that the current world is no longer so neat.", "[INDISCERNIBLE 00:41:02]", "And there were kind of rules and protocols of what you do, especially by the latter phase of the Cold War.", " Well, that\u2019s right. But even if you don\u2019t like the terminology, as I know\u2014clearly, the situation between the two countries is as hostile, if not more so, than at any period since the late Cold War. Arguably, during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev, we were on much better terms as a country during the, say, the George H.W. Bush administration, even during the second Reagan administration. On much better terms with the Soviet Union than we are with Russia today. ", "So, how do you view that? I mean, how scared should we be by this level of hostility?", "Personally, I\u2019m very scared. And the one question I\u2019ll add to the outstanding questions is Donald Trump\u2019s motivations. You know, for this consistently laudatory rhetoric toward Russia and Putin, and I think we still don\u2019t know the answer to that. But about the\u2014", "Why are you very scared?", " The reason I\u2019m scared is because, like I said, I think in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just\u2014the way things were done. On the Soviet side and on the Russian side. Now, you have kind of flimsier systems in place. There are fewer rules. And you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful. Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent.", "And I worry that they\u2019re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage. I also worry that Putin\u2014you know, this isn\u2019t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs.", "And this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he\u2019s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist. And I worry that in this showdown Putin\u2019s going to outmaneuver Trump and the U.S.", " Well, you know, it\u2019s interesting. Before he was thrown out, H. R. McMasters authored a new National Security Strategy for the United States. And it\u2019s actually very similar to the new national defense strategy penned by Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense. And they lump Russia together with China and basically say the age of counterterrorism, post-9/11 obsession is over, and we have to return and renew a focus as a country on the challenges that count from great powers Russia and China, that we\u2019re in a new era of competition with Russia and China.", "And arguably, that\u2019s an era that began before Donald Trump; it\u2019s likely to continue after Trump has left office, whenever that is. And so what I\u2019m struck by is that Americans\u2014even if you put aside this question of Donald Trump\u2014they\u2019re not really prepared for that kind of a confrontation, and right now, of course, you don\u2019t really have a president who is leading or shaping that. Barack Obama didn\u2019t buy into that either, by the way. Many of his advisers did, but Barack Obama demeaned and belittled Russia and basically dismissed them as insignificant in the sweep of history, a finished and doomed former superpower. Maybe that\u2019s a bit of the problem. ", "Right. So, the issue is, do we really buy and accept this notion that, rather than America as the one superpower going forward, we have entered the post-American age, the age when we will struggle\u2014not that we won\u2019t be a power, but that when we will struggle and compete with other powers like China and Russia for dominance? ", " Well, this has been a thing that Vladimir Putin has been remarkably consistent about, and in 2007, when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference, he said that basically the liberal order that was established in 1991 at the end of the Cold War is over, and we don\u2019t agree to it, and we want to rediscuss and renegotiate the terms of surrender. ", "Yes, so now we\u2019re relitigating. ", "Yes, no more unipolar world, where America calls all the shots with no friction, because we\u2019ve seen\u2014I mean, this was happening in 2007, again, four years after the invasion of Iraq and six years after the invasion of Afghanistan. And one of which\u2014the invasion of Iraq\u2014Putin was firmly against, and at that point he had been kind of proven right. Things had spiraled out of control in Iraq. And he said, you know, that\u2019s it. No more\u2014you guys can\u2019t just go around doing whatever you want, especially you can\u2019t call the shots on who gets to rule which country.", "And I think that\u2019s what Syria\u2019s about; it\u2019s kind of drawing a line and saying, \u201cAmerica cannot say so-and-so must go. It\u2019s just not within their power. And we have something to say about that, too, and we will push back in a very real way.\u201d ", " So, welcome to the future\u2026", "He\u2019s achieved it, yes.", " We will compete with Russia and China for influence, authority, power and advantage, whether military or economic.", "I mean, and I think it\u2019s helpful to\u2014getting back to your very first question about the often ignorant way in which Russia is discussed in Washington\u2014I think it\u2019s not just about pride of intellect and expertise; it\u2019s about accurately diagnosing the problem and knowing what it is you\u2019re dealing with, right? You don\u2019t want to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy.", "And I think we have to understand that Russia is going to continue throwing sand in the gears, or weightier objects, and that they\u2019re going to be a force that is constantly going to push back\u2014often just to push back.

And I\u2019ll leave the final word, actually, to another friend of ours, Anne Applebaum, in a conversation that she and I had a few months ago on The Global Politico", "She said, Well, we actually have a clearer sense at this point in time of what Russia\u2019s intentions are than we do of what Washington and what Donald Trump is going to do about it. \u201cImagine if we were fighting the Cold War all over again, except only one side was fighting it.\u201d And I think that\u2019s an important question to leave us with.

Four times over the past year, in Geneva, Pyongyang, Oslo and Moscow, DiMaggio has secretly met with North Koreans to talk about the country\u2019s nuclear program. But what they really want to talk about, DiMaggio said in an extensive new interview for The Global Politico, is America\u2019s volatile president. ", "The North Koreans have asked her not only if Trump is nuts, DiMaggio said, but what and how to think about everything from his public undercutting of his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia.", "\u201cThey really want to know what is his end game,\u201d said DiMaggio, a scholar at New America who specializes in talking with rogue regimes and has spent the past two years in these secret discussions with the North Koreans. She believes they were ready after Trump\u2019s surprise election to discuss a new round of official talks with the U.S. to defuse the standoff over their nuclear weapons\u2014but that Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric and Twitter rants such as his weekend taunting of North Korea\u2019s \u201cshort and fat\u201d Kim Jong Un may have foreclosed that option. \u201cThey follow the news very closely; they watch CNN 24/7; they read his tweets and other things.\u201d", "Among issues the North Koreans have raised with her in recent months, DiMaggio said, were everything from Trump\u2019s tweet urging Tillerson to give up on diplomacy with North Korea (\u201cIs this a good cop/bad cop that he\u2019s doing with Tillerson?\u201d) to Trump\u2019s decision this fall to decertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear deal forged by his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Now she and Wit are speaking out despite their past reluctance even to acknowledge the North Korean meetings, describing them in a recent ", " and adding new detail in this week\u2019s episode of our Global Politico podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t normally talk about my \u2018Track 2\u2019 work in such a public way,\u201d DiMaggio tweeted. \u201cBut these are far from normal times.\u201d", "Their account comes at a fraught moment in the burgeoning crisis with North Korea, with Trump wrapping up a 12-day Asia tour after sending confusing and contradictory signals. The president initially projected an uncharacteristically diplomatic approach on the trip, suggesting a new openness to negotiations as a way out of the nuclear impasse, delivering a strongly worded address in Seoul about North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses, and pressing the Chinese in Beijing to make common cause with the U.S. on stepped-up sanctions against the neighboring North Korean regime.", "But even before a final stop in Manila, Trump was back into a war of words with Kim that seemed to undercut the trip\u2019s scripted statesmanship. While DiMaggio and Wit had no definitive answer for the North Koreans when they had asked if Trump was crazy, the North Koreans clearly came to their own conclusion. Responding to Trump\u2019s Seoul speech, North Korea\u2019s state media called him a \u201clunatic old man\u201d looking to start a nuclear war. It warned that the United States faced an \u201cabyss of doom\u201d unless it gets rid of Trump and abandons his \u201chostile policy.\u201d", "Trump, 71, seemed more miffed at the attack on his age than his sanity. Abandoning the carefully formulated statements of his advisers, he tweeted back his outrage about being called old, while insisting, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had tried to become a \u201cfriend\u201d to Kim and sarcastically claiming that at least he had never called the rotund young dictator \u201cshort and fat.\u201d", "Even before that exchange, DiMaggio and Wit told me Trump\u2019s penchant for insulting the North Koreans and their leader in unusually personal terms violated rule No. 1 of what the U.S. government has learned over the years about interacting with the North Koreans: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t personally insult this man,\u201d as DiMaggio put it.", "In fact, the name-calling repeats an American tactic that has backfired with previous North Korean leaders. \u201cThe idea that the administration has\u2014and particularly President Trump\u2014that escalating threats is going to make the North Koreans be more flexible, is wrong. Escalating threats only make North Koreans more inflexible,\u201d Wit said. \u201cBeing gratuitously tough, \u201c he added later, \u201cis a big mistake, because the North Koreans can be tough as nails themselves, and for them, being weak is like committing suicide.\u201d", "But Trump has once again gone in for tough talk anyway. Will it matter? After all, U.S. presidents have been trying and failing to stop Kim, his father and grandfather for two more than two decades from nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.", "Still, in the interview, DiMaggio and Wit recounted what they believe to be an overlooked willingness on the part of the North Koreans to engage in new negotiations with the incoming Trump administration, an option they now fear may be no longer available. \u201cMy concern is that because of all these contradictory statements and the threats, that the narrow window that is opened, I believe, for conducting talks is gradually closing,\u201d DiMaggio said. ", "In recent weeks, Wit has publicly put the odds of a military conflict at 40 percent, while former CIA Director John Brennan has assessed them at 25 percent amid signs of escalating U.S. military activity that many experts worry could trigger miscalculation or even outright aggression by North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s not the actual military moves,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, who served as the Pentagon\u2019s deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s when they\u2019re put together with this inflated rhetoric. That\u2019s when I start getting worried about the increased potential for misunderstanding\u2014and actual conflict.\u201d", "***", ", according to DiMaggio and Wit. ", "In fact, the North Koreans agreed with Trump that Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d\u2014essentially, waiting for them to buckle\u2014had failed. \u201cVery early on, the North Koreans conveyed that they saw a new administration as a potential fresh start,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cThe relationship with the Obama administration had turned so sour, especially after the U.S. sanctioned Kim Jong Un personally. That really blew the relationship out of the water.\u201d", "Wit agreed that, while it got little attention at the time, the Obama administration had misread Kim when he succeeded his father in 2010, and had failed to pursue new nuclear talks before then that might have kept the North Koreans further away from achieving a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the continental U.S., a breakthrough they are now on the brink of making. Obama\u2019s approach, Wit said, now looks like a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d", "Given how close North Korea is to achieving that breakthrough, North Korea watchers are divided on how seriously to take the North Korean outreach at the start of the Trump administration and many worry that the Trump team, with a weakened Tillerson and depleted, demoralized diplomatic corps (there are no more than two current U.S. officials, Wit said, who have even met North Koreans), might not be able to undertake meaningful nuclear talks anyway. ", "But DiMaggio insisted in the interview that it was a genuine approach.", "\u201cBased on my conversations with them immediately after the inauguration, when I traveled to Pyongyang to meet them, they were very clear that this could be a new beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t have any illusions that things would be easy, but I think they were willing at least to consider the idea of talks with the United States without preconditions at that time.\u201d ", "That same offer, she said, was made to the senior State Department envoy for North Korea, Joseph Yun, in meetings she brokered, and she believes it was still possible a few weeks ago, when she met a senior North Korean diplomat in Moscow. \u201cShe left the door open to talks with the United States,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cShe had some thoughts on what would need to happen in order for that to take place, but it was a narrow opening, and I think that\u2019s the way we should interpret it.\u201d", "Then again, the encounter in Moscow also underscored how close Pyongyang is to achieving the nuclear-power status it has long coveted: arming itself with a nuclear weapon that can directly target the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way to accomplishing that,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cSo, the real question is, will they wait until after they\u2019re able to declare that they\u2019ve achieved that, or demonstrate it to a point where they feel satisfaction that they\u2019ve reached a satisfactory outcome? And will they return to the table at that time?\u201d", "At least in part, the answer may depend on all those questions they\u2019ve been peppering her with about Trump. Is he a reliable negotiator?

He ticked off a list of issues on which he said the committee now agrees across party lines\u2014and over which it appears to be more or less in open conflict with the Trump administration. Among them are imposing mandatory new sanctions on Russia, which ultimately passed the Senate 98-2 over the White House\u2019s objections, keeping the Iran nuclear deal in place and pursuing a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff with North Korea.", "It\u2019s a striking list. In more than two decades of observing Capitol Hill, I can\u2019t remember a comparable moment when the generally staid Foreign Relations panel has been so assertive toward the president, especially given that Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party. To do so, you\u2019d probably have to reach all the way back to the Vietnam era, and the skeptical hearings about the war held by the late, legendary Chairman William Fulbright.", "\u201cClearly, Congress has taken on a stronger role. You see that with the sanctions bill we passed with Russia\u2014and, by the way, also with North Korea and Iran\u2014that discretion that is normally given to the president has been taken over by Congress in our role as the policy arm of government,\u201d Cardin told me. \u201cWe have been more prescriptive on the responsibilities of the president on foreign policy, and that\u2019s Congress\u2019 prerogative, and we\u2019ve done that under President Trump. Yes, we are taking a more active role.\u201d", "Corker offered a highly symbolic\u2014or at least seriously trollish\u2014signal of how far he\u2019s willing to take his feud with Trump last week when he held a hearing on the president\u2019s authority to order a nuclear strike\u2014the first time in 40 years that such an issue has been discussed on Capitol Hill. The session was widely\u2014and correctly, Cardin said\u2014interpreted as a senatorial rebuke of the president\u2019s loose and inflammatory rhetoric about the \u201cfire and fury\u201d he might unleash against North Korea. \u201cCongress is looking for a way to assert itself in that regard,\u201d Cardin said.", "Some skepticism is certainly in order here. Congress isn\u2019t about to wrest control of nukes\u2014or any other major levers of international power\u2014away from the commander-in-chief anytime soon. Despite post-Vietnam efforts to rein in the imperial presidency, the executive branch retains nearly all the control over American foreign policy. And many members of Congress are just as happy to punt when it comes to taking responsibility for decisions of war and peace that might prove unpopular with voters, a fact painfully underscored when President Barack Obama decided to seek authorization for a retaliatory strike on Syria after a chemical weapons attack on its own citizens\u2014and members of Congress all but hid under their desks.", "So no one\u2019s suggesting Congress has suddenly grown a spine under Trump.", "But the bipartisan talk of constraining and at times openly contradicting the president is something genuinely different about Trump\u2019s Washington, and it already extends to a wide range of issues on the foreign policy front\u2014a contrast to the fractured politics of such domestic issues as health care and taxes, where consensus is as elusive as the election results would suggest. ", "While those policy debates play out along more predictable Republican vs. Democrat lines, Cardin made the case for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will hang together against Trump on most of the pressing foreign policy issues of the day. He did not spell out exactly which Republicans he believes to be aligned with Democrats on these issues, though the panel does include, in addition to Corker, several other Republicans whose foreign policy views differ from Trump\u2019s, such as his primary rival Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and another outspoken critic in Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who like Corker is not running for reelection.", "\u201cWe believe that the best course for containing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is through diplomacy, and we disagree with the language the president has used, and the fact that he\u2019s made it more difficult for diplomacy to work. We believe that in regard to the Iran nuclear agreement, that we have to enforce the agreement rigorously, but we don\u2019t want the United States unilaterally withdrawing from that agreement,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what most Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee believe, and certainly in regard to Russia,\u201d where Trump\u2019s public \u201cembracing Mr. Putin was the wrong signal,\u201d and triggered the overwhelming Senate vote to overrule him on sanctions.", "Both Cardin and Corker have also been increasingly critical of Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, warning of the department\u2019s plummeting morale, \u201cdecapitation of leadership,\u201d and ill-considered reorganization plans \u2013 foolish own-goals, for Cardin, at a time when the president has publicly undercut his top diplomat and devalued the role of diplomacy in America\u2019 s foreign policy.", "Tillerson \u201chas made several major mistakes,\u201d Cardin told me. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been the advocate for the Department of State he should have been.\u201d When Trump proposed a more than 30 percent cut to the department\u2019s budget, in fact, it was not Tillerson who objected\u2014but Corker, who called it a \u201cnonstarter\u201d and refused even to take it seriously as a basis for negotiations. In our interview, Cardin said he expects the budget that will ultimately pass the Republican-controlled Senate to be a \u201crepudiation\u201d of the Republican president\u2019s State budget.", "A new confrontation could soon be brewing over Russia on the Hill, as the Trump administration faces a January deadline for imposing a first round of additional sanctions. The State Department missed the initial deadline to produce names of entitles to be sanctioned, leading many in Congress to wonder whether this was the Trump team slow-walking a policy to which the president remains opposed. ", "Administration sources have told me it\u2019s not that, but a bureaucratic failure to meet the initial deadline, reflecting the lack of staffing and disorganization that remains persistent inside the State Department under its budget-cutting secretary\u2014another black mark against Tillerson.", "Cardin is not so sure but either way, he said, Congress will remain adamant about pushing Trump to get it done. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very carefully to make sure they, in fact, impose the mandatory sanctions on the due dates,\u201d Cardin said, \u201cbut we do know there is a reluctance on the behalf of the Trump administration.\u201d ", "Unlike some of his Democratic colleagues, Cardin is no newcomer to the ranks of Russia hawks. In fact, you could even say he helped trigger Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to intervene in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.", "A longtime human rights activist who co-chaired the Helsinki Commission, Cardin teamed up with Republican Senator John McCain to pass the Magnitsky Act\u2014over the objections of the Obama administration. Cardin and his staff worked closely on the bill to sanction corrupt Russian government officials with Bill Browder, a Western investor in Russia whose lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was unjustly imprisoned in Moscow after uncovering a massive fraud that implicated government officials, and later died in jail. In retaliation for the Magnitsky sanctions, Putin ordered an end to American adoptions of Russian children.", "And that was precisely the issue about which Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya came to meet with Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign chief in Trump Tower during last year\u2019s campaign\u2014a meeting now part of the investigation into Putin\u2019s election meddling.", "Special counsel Robert Mueller has just issued the first indictments to flow from that investigation, and Cardin said when I asked about the probe that he believes \u201cthere\u2019s lots of dots, and they\u2019re starting to be connected\u201d as far as Russia\u2019s interference and ties to the Trump team.", "But beyond that, he wouldn\u2019t comment about the investigation and whether it could, or should, lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment, as some Democrats are already beginning to say. After all, he noted, the Senate would have to sit in judgment in any trial of the president after an impeachment.

He would become, the group open letter Cohen organized said, \u201cthe most reckless president in American history.\u201d", "Story Continued Below", "A year later, Cohen, a top official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and another charter #NeverTrump proselytizer, his fellow conservative Max Boot, hardly back down when asked whether their predictions of global gloom and doom had been proven right in the first year of the Trump presidency. Both men, lifelong Republicans and historically minded policy intellectuals, offered unequivocal yeses in a joint interview for this week\u2019s Global Politico podcast \u2013 and castigated former friends inside the party they\u2019ve both now renounced as \u201cVichy Republicans\u201d for collaborating with a president they believe is not fit to hold office. ", "Boot pronounced Trump both \u201cincredibly erratic and unpredictable,\u201d though he allowed that \u201csome of the worst-case scenarios that we imagined have yet, mercifully, come to pass.\u201d Just because Trump has not yet destroyed NATO, launched a trade war with China or torn up NAFTA, lifted sanctions on Russia in a grand bargain with Vladimir Putin, or started a war with North Korea, Boot argued, does not mean he won\u2019t.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true, they haven\u2019t started World War III yet,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty low bar.\u201d", "If anything, I found the two even more terrified about the Trump presidency at the end of Year One \u2013 filled with the sort of to-the-barricades warnings I\u2019m still not used to hearing from learned defense wonks like Boot, who\u2019s spent a career advising politicians like Republican Senator John McCain from establishment precincts like the Wall Street Journal op-ed page and the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d Boot said, \u201cthe damage he\u2019s doing at home is even worse, where he\u2019s undermining the rule of law. He\u2019s obstructing justice. He\u2019s lending the support of the presidency to monsters like Roy Moore. He is exacerbating race relations. He is engaging in the most blatant xenophobia, racism and general bigotry that we have seen from the White House.\u201d", "\u201cAll these things,\u201d he added, \u201care very corrosive to the future of American democracy.\u201d", "Throughout the wide-ranging conversation, they addressed the toll \u2013 personal as well as political \u2013 that Trump\u2019s takeover of their party has had, from broken friendships\u201d and Republican officeholders \u201cwho have permanently sullied themselves\u201d to a GOP unmoored from basic principles like free trade and promotion of democracy that were long seen as its bedrock precepts. Cohen talked of his own \u201cpermanently ruptured\u201d relationships as a consequence of Trump, not to mention the sad spectacle of \u201cspineless\u201d careerists taking jobs with a man they don\u2019t believe in, while Boot elaborated on the \u201cdisorienting experience\u201d of having close friends who\u2019ve \u201cgone off the rails\u201d \u2013 a split worse than any, he argued, since the Vietnam war. Cohen disagreed, but only because he saw the divide caused by Trump hearkening back even further, to the foreign policy debates of the inward-looking 1920s and 30s that caused America to be dangerously unprepared on the brink of World War II.", "Weren\u2019t they being just a bit hysterical about the negative consequences of Trump, I pressed Boot?", "\u201cLook,\u201d he responded, \u201cthe good news story of the first year of the Trump presidency is that there are checks and balances\u2026.

That\u2019s one \u201cL\u201d by the way. ", " ", " Yes. ", " ", " No, but seriously, you know, both of them are prolific writers. They\u2019re authors. They\u2019re experts on their subject. And over the last couple years have taken this dramatic turn into being the very public face of the Trump resistance inside the Republican Party. And now we can talk about their feelings about the Republican Party going forward.", " In the foreign policy and national security world\u2014Eliot, I want to start with you\u2014there was unusually vociferous resistance from this part of the Republican Party, even during the primaries. You helped to organize these letters by national security types who\u2019d served in Republican administrations. You got a lot of people to sign. Why do you think people spoke up more in the national security world than in the more general Republican political world, and why didn\u2019t it make a difference?", " ", " Well, it\u2019s easy to explain why it didn\u2019t make a difference. You know, I don\u2019t think average voters pay a whole lot of attention to what people who\u2019ve been in the State Department, or Defense Department, or who write about these things have to say. The thing that was at the center of the\u2014there were actually two letters, one of which I helped write, the other which I helped organize. ", " The criticism of Trump was fundamentally a criticism of character. I mean, yes, there are policy issues which were raised, but I think that was at the heart of the critique. And why was it that there was such a reaction from that community? I\u2019d like to think that some of it is, you know, when you\u2019re in that community\u2014and particularly, you\u2019ve served in government, or you\u2019ve been intimately involved in it, and seen it up close, say the way Max has\u2014is you realize this is life and death. This is about putting lives on the line. These are enormously consequential kinds of decisions that a president makes. And character really trumps, so to speak, everything else. ", " And so you may have a keener appreciation of the importance of character than, perhaps, if you\u2019re more involved in domestic issues. I don\u2019t know what Max was going to say. ", " ", " You know, it\u2019s interesting. I went back and reread those letters before our conversation today. The one from August 2016 said that Donald Trump, if he were elected president\u2014which my guess is you guys didn\u2019t think was all that likely at that point in time\u2014but that if he we were elected, he would become \u201cthe most reckless president in American history.\u201d Do you still agree with that, Max?", " ", " Without a doubt. I mean, he is still incredibly erratic and unpredictable. And you see that now with the saber-rattling that he\u2019s engaged in with North Korea. I mean, I can actually approve of some of his North Korea policy, the sanctions, for example, doing things that other presidents would have done. But it\u2019s impossible to imagine any other president going before the U.N. General Assembly and referring to the dictator of North Korea as \u201cRocket Man,\u201d or issuing this series of blustery threats, which, frankly, are terrifying, and are raising the risk of a needless war. ", " And so that\u2019s an example, I think, of the kind of erratic behavior that many of us feared once Trump came into office. And I think you\u2019re seeing evidence of that, even though, you know, some of the worst-case scenarios that we imagined have not yet, mercifully, come to pass. I mean, for example, he has not destroyed NATO. He has not launched a trade war with China. He has not lifted sanctions on Russia. In all those cases, in part, because his hands had been tied. And of course, it\u2019s only a year in, so he\u2019s still got time to go.", " But what I think what we\u2019ve seen has been pretty bad, and pretty terrifying, and confirms the case that those of us who were #NeverTrumpers were making prior to the election.", " ", " And I would just add to that that even those cases where he hasn\u2019t, say, you know, taken the United States out of NATO, the damage that\u2019s been done is extremely serious. His refusal to reaffirm in a serious way our commitment to protect our European allies under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which says an attack against one is an attack against all.

", " ", " When I was doing that reporting, and it turned out that his advisors had put the sentence in his speech and he took it out himself. ", " ", " In some ways the most appalling thing of all, that he continues to question the fact of a very serious Russian attack on the core of our political system. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you get more reckless and dangerous than that. And you know, the president\u2019s first obligation is to defend the country. And in this respect, he doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in doing that. ", " ", " Okay. So if you believe that the premise of your letter was right, tactically was it the right thing? It clearly got under Donald Trump\u2019s skin, and he issued a ", " once he became president that no one who signed that letter could participate in the administration. Do you think that we would be better off if more of the signatories were allowed in?", " ", " Just quickly, it also had another unintended consequence that we can see in hindsight, because the criticism of him from the foreign policy community caused him to round up some kind of foreign policy advisers, so he could put together a team to address the concerns that he didn\u2019t have advisers. And who did he get in the team? He wound up with people like Carter Page, George\u2014", " ", " George Papadopoulos.", " ", " \u2014Papadopoulos, and Mike Flynn. And so a lot of the problems that he\u2019s experiencing now are in part because of the shady characters that he signed up to deflect that criticism.", " ", " Yeah. Well, look, just as a matter of fact, it\u2019s not just that they wouldn\u2019t approach the people who signed the letters, they have\u2014and I know of a number of cases personally\u2014they\u2019ve disbarred all kinds of people, you know, for retweeting something that was even mildly critical. But these were people who\u2019d not signed the letter. So I think this is a man who is hypersensitive, has no idea what magnanimity means, and all that. ", " But look, I do think this is a crisis for our country. And at that moment, you know, there are certain times in politics where you have to be politic, and you have to be careful of what you say. Then there are other times where the most important thing to do is to speak the truth as you understand it. And you know, Max and I are both intellectuals. I\u2019m not embarrassed about that. And part of our job is to speak the truth as we understand it. ", " And I think that everybody who signed those letters had that basic feeling. You know, we didn\u2019t expect that Trump would win, but I think all of us realized that there was a serious chance that he might. ", " ", " That\u2019s interesting. I remember running into someone who signed your letter early on, and running into him on an airplane. And he said, \u201cYou know, I still think there\u2019s actually a chance that Trump could win.\u201d This was at a time when people thought he wasn\u2019t going to win. He said, \u201cBut I found it kind of a calming and clarifying moment for me. It\u2019s so fundamental. It\u2019s actually very revealing for me to see who\u2019s not signing this. And so rather than feeling like it\u2019s a divisive thing, I find I\u2019m quite happy to have signed this, and I feel like it\u2019s just one of those moments where you have to pick a team.\u201d", " ", " Honestly and truly, the moment when I decided to do this, we\u2019d had my kids over to the house and my grandchildren. I was looking at my little granddaughter and I was just thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when she comes back home on spring break, you know, 15, 16 years from now, and she says, \u2018Grandpa, I\u2019ve been reading about this crazy period and I guess you were around there. I know you wrote a lot, but what did you do when this was happening?\u2019\u201d And I just thought, \u201cI have to be able to give her a decent answer.\u201d", " ", " Yes. I mean, I was just outraged about Trump from day one, when he rode down that damn escalator at the Trump Tower and started bashing Mexicans. I mean, I could not believe this was a mainstream political candidate in the United States. I was just\u2014like everybody else, I kind of assumed that he was going to be a flash in the pan; that the Republican Party could never possibly nominate him. And once he was nominated, I kind of assumed that he would never be elected. And of course, I was dead wrong about his electoral prospects.", " But I think I was dead right in my judgment that this is somebody who is not fit to hold office, and I think he has shown that pretty much every single day that he has been in office. And I think one of the shocking, if not entirely surprising, things is the extent to which he has not changed one iota. He has not become one degree more presidential in the year since he took office. So needless to say, he has not actually achieved, as he claimed that he would be more presidential than anybody since the great Abraham Lincoln.", " ", " He often compares himself to Abraham Lincoln. Just the other day, I noticed that he said it was he and Abraham Lincoln who\u2019d gotten rid of the most government regulations. I want to keep on this theme of both this decisive moment that you both chose to take action on. What have been the consequences? Both of you were long-time Republicans. I\u2019m curious how much you think that this rift reflects something that was a broader rift in the party, or is it really just a breakup over Trump himself?", " ", " I think there are two rifts, actually. One is within the party. I think George W. Bush is reported to have worried that he might be the last Republican president. And he understood, I think, that there were elements in the party which were really completely at odds with his version of what it is to be a conservative; that there was this populist, nativist element there, which Trump has been effective at tapping. So that\u2019s a rift within the Republican Party.", " Since then, there has been a rift, I think, within\u2014it\u2019s not just the foreign policy establishment, but a certain political establishment more broadly between those who said, \u201cUgh, well, I don\u2019t particularly like him, but we\u2019ve got to get along, and hold your nose. It\u2019s really important to get the tax cut,\u201d or, \u201cOkay, you made your point. Now everybody should go to work for this guy.\u201d Those of us who really just say, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to continue to say what we think he is, and not yield,\u201d and that rift is a much more personal one. ", " I\u2019m sure Max has had the experience. I know I\u2019ve had the experience of people with whom I wouldn\u2019t say were very close friends, but who were friends of a sort, where those relationships are permanently ruptured, I think.", " ", " It\u2019s a disorienting experience to have people that you\u2019ve thought of as your friends and comrades in arms for years, you know, think that you\u2019ve gone off the rails. And at the same time, you think they\u2019ve gone off the rails. I mean, this was the kind of split in American politics we probably have not had since the Vietnam War days. I mean, this is not a normal partisan disagreement. It\u2019s a political realignment. ", " I mean, I spent my entire adult life as a Republican. I worked as an adviser on three Republican presidential campaigns, but now I\u2019m actively rooting for Republicans to lose the congressional elections next year, because the Republicans have shown they are unwilling to uphold their oaths of office. They are unwilling to defend the Constitution against the nonstop threats emanating from Donald J. Trump. And that, to me, trumps, so to speak, anything else, including concerns about tax cuts, or any of these other issues that a lot of Republicans tell themselves are the most important thing in the world.", " ", " So it\u2019s had a personal effect on relationships here in Washington. There\u2019s also the question of what do you make of those who\u2019ve chosen to serve? A lot of people say, \u201cWell, you know, thank God for Jim Mattis and H. R. McMaster because if not for them, who knows? We might already be in that war in North Korea.\u201d Do you think they\u2019re there to save the country, or to enable Trump?", " ", " Well, I\u2019ve written a little bit about this in some things I do in ", ". And I try not to be personally too judgmental of them. I think human beings are complicated, and they do the things they do for mixed motives. And sometimes those motives are not always entirely apparent to themselves. And sometimes the motives change over time. ", " I think in the case of Mattis, McMaster, probably Kelly too, you know, they didn\u2019t volunteer for the jobs they got. They were asked to take them, and I think they took them, in part\u2014in part\u2014understanding who Trump was, and desiring to contain him. My view\u2014and I know all three, those three in particular, quite well. I think Mattis has done not only the best job, but a pretty fine job of maintaining his integrity as a human being and as kind of a loyal servant to the Constitution. I think the others have been more challenged.", " ", " Do you agree with that, Max?", " ", " Yeah. I think it\u2019s much harder when you\u2019re actually in the White House. I mean, again, like Eliot, I know all those guys, and have admired them for years. And I think that Mattis has been masterful in the way that he has kept his distance from the White House, from the craziness emanating from Donald Trump, but he hasn\u2019t alienated Trump in the way that Tillerson, for example, has done, in a way that\u2019s undercut Tillerson\u2019s effectiveness.", " So I think Mattis has done exactly what everybody expected him to do, which is to be a responsible steward over our armed forces. You know, I\u2019m also an admirer, by and large, of what H. R. McMaster and John Kelly have done. But I think it\u2019s much harder for them because they are in much closer proximity to Trump, and he demands much more from those around him, that they have to be constantly obsequious. He expects people to lie on his behalf. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve\u2014you know, nine-tenths of the demands that he makes on them, they\u2019ve probably resisted, and they\u2019ve probably felt compelled to give in, in a few instances. ", " But on the whole, I think that I\u2019m very glad that they are there. I sleep much more soundly at night, for example, knowing that H. R. McMaster\u2019s the national security advisor rather than Mike Flynn.", " ", " I agree with that. But I also think\u2014I\u2019m just saying this as an observer. Again, I don\u2019t pass judgment on them\u2014that you pay a price doing that, and you pay a price in terms of who you are at the end of the process. You know, you have to be careful about analogies. But I do sometimes think about senior civil servants during the Vichy period in France where, you know, there were perfectly principled people. They didn\u2019t want Philippe Petain running what was left of France. But they felt, \u201cWell, if not me, who else, and I can make it better.\u201d But the problem is it does lead you down\u2014it can lead you down a slippery slope\u2014", " ", " Well, that\u2019s right. And that\u2019s, of course, the Washington sort of political mindset anyways, right, is that mixture of careerism, and patriotism, and also conflating your own interests with those of the job. And you\u2019ve written about this. ", " ", " Yeah. I\u2019ve called it \u201clow-grade Shakespeare,\u201d and it is.", " ", " Right. Well, maybe we haven\u2019t built up to high-grade Shakespeare yet.

Increasingly this case of, okay, A, the world isn\u2019t on fire. We haven\u2019t started any new wars. The policy is good.

But looking at home, I mean, I think, in many ways, the damage he\u2019s doing at home is even worse, where he\u2019s undermining the rule of law. He\u2019s actively obstructing justice. He\u2019s backing\u2014he\u2019s lending the support of the presidency to monsters like Roy Moore. He is exacerbating race relations. He is engaging in the most blatant xenophobia, racism, and general bigotry that we have seen from the White House.", " I mean, all these things, I think, are very corrosive for the future of American democracy.

You know, it\u2019s true, they haven\u2019t started World War III yet. That\u2019s a pretty low bar, I have to say, for an American administration. Max made the point earlier, which I quite agree with, is they could get us into a really nasty war that\u2019s not necessary in Korea. They could do something similar in the Persian Gulf. But I also think the word \u201ccorrosive\u201d is right; that a lot of what they\u2019ve done is to kind of rot out a lot of the American\u2014or to begin the process of rotting out the American position in the world with things that are not particularly dramatic.", " But when you talk, as I often do, to leaders in Germany, or France, or Canada, or Australia, I mean, their view of the United States is changing. And they understand that, yes, Trump may have been a bit of an anomaly, but you guys elected him. And that damage is serious. The damage that\u2019s done when he cuddles up to someone like President Duterte in the Philippines, who is a murderer and a thug, these things do really long-term damage.

And you become incapable of seeing the world as people from the outside see it. I\u2019m sure that given the psychic pressures that all these people are under, given the fact that deep down in their hearts they know what an awful guy he is, they really are, at some level, I\u2019m sure, headcases. You know, that they are really ending up with a lot of psychic burdens in addition to kind of a distorted view of the world.", " ", " Max, you made the point that we\u2019re undergoing kind of a political realignment; that it\u2019s not just Trump, but there\u2019 s also Trumpism, and that it\u2019s challenging in many ways some of the basic\u2014what we all probably thought of as settled, established principles of America and its leadership role in the world. Where do you see us coming out of that? I mean, are Republicans going to no longer be the party of free trade? Are they, as a party, going to end support for American engagement in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East?", " ", " Well, those are very good questions. I think Republicans are very confused on those issues, as is Donald Trump himself.

I mean, remember, this is the party of Lincoln. Now, unfortunately, it\u2019s the party of Donald Trump. I think Republican office holders have permanently sullied themselves by not standing up against Donald Trump\u2019s assaults on the rule of law and basic decency, and in fact, making excuses for him, and doing his bidding, as they\u2019re doing now, for example, by aiding and abetting his attempts to obstruct justice by undermining Robert Mueller and his special counsel investigation.", " I think that, you know, makes it hard for me to imagine that, personally, for example, I\u2019m going to become a Republican again.

I think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. If it were to happen, I would have to reassess the Republican Party. But at the moment, I have to say, I feel pretty homeless because I\u2019m not a Republican, but I\u2019m not a Democrat either because I\u2019m still worried about folks like Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, and they don\u2019t really speak for where I am either.

It\u2019s a crisis of political parties. It\u2019s a crisis of elites, which I think we\u2019re seeing. I completely agree with Max. I find it hard to imagine the Republicans reconstituting themselves as a genuinely conservative party. I mean, just look at, say, the tax cuts that they\u2019re about to have. I mean, I vaguely remember when the Republicans were the party of fiscal conservatism, which is what conservatives are supposed to stand for. That\u2019s clearly gone.

So I imagined, \u201cWell, most Republicans couldn\u2019t possibly imagine voting for this guy because they\u2019re real conservatives in this race, like Jeb Bush and others, John Kasich, et cetera, and one of those guys will win.\u201d And of course, that is not what happened.

It didn\u2019t occur to us. Nobody told us.\u201d That record will be out there, and it will be clear that people were warned, were told.

", " But Donald Trump is not a fine individual and he appeals to that dark side, and he has shown how much of the support for Republican candidates around the country is based on some of these dark impulses. And frankly, to me, it\u2019s been unnerving. It\u2019s been deeply disturbing as somebody who was a life-long Republican, because what I see happening is that a lot of the criticisms the Democrats have made about Republicans\u2014and which I resisted for years\u2014have actually been vindicated.", " ", " I\u2019m a little bit less disturbed than Max is, I think, because\u2014I mean, I feel that I was na\u00efve.

And so, okay, what I\u2019m realizing is, yes, these forces have always been here. They do periodically go underground, and they reemerge. But even to the extent they\u2019ve reemerged, they haven\u2019t reemerged the way they were in the \u201920s and \u201930s. Okay, that means that this is our turn, and it\u2019s our responsibility to point them out, and stand up against them.", " ", " Right. But things could get worse instead of better.

I just have this faith in the resilience of the United States, and American institutions, and the American people. I\u2019ve confidence in the action and directions that demography is going among other things. But more importantly, it\u2019s the faith in our institutions. The challenge, I think, is we could be in for a very turbulent 3, 10, 12 years, or something like that.

That actually disturbs me a lot. ", " ", " I\u2019m a little less optimistic that Eliot. And I should preface that by saying that, for most of my life, I\u2019ve been cockeyed optimist about America. I\u2019ve very much believed in that Reaganesque vision of America as a city on a shining hill. I mean, I was not born in this country. I\u2019m an immigrant, so I had maybe this kind of starry-eyed affection for America, and its place in the world. I think it\u2019s been the greatest force for good in world history over the last 100 years. ", " But this has really shaken me to the core. Referring to something that Eliot said in the past, I think it\u2019s also shaken our allies. And for our allies, I think it will be very difficult, if it\u2019s even possible in the future, to trust America in the same way they did before. Even if we have a successor to Trump who is completely different from him in every respect, they will know that these impulses are still here, and it\u2019s quite possible that the American electorate will choose somebody like Trump, or somebody even worse that Trump.

I think my parents lived through the Great Depression, and World War II, and the Cold War, and Joe McCarthy, and Korea, and Vietnam, and the cities going up in flames. And my grandparents, who immigrated here, lived through all that, plus pogroms, World War I, and the influenza epidemic. So who says we get off free?\u201d ", " And I guess that colors my reaction to this. And I would also say, you know the great story about the Constitutional Convention, which meets in secret, and after they\u2019re done, Benjamin Franklin is leaving the hall, and somebody says, \u201cWhat kind of government have you given us, Dr. Franklin,\u201d and he said, \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d Which means that it\u2019s always up to us.

Do you feel better listening to him?", " ", " Well\u2014", " ", " He\u2019s a professor, after all. ", " ", " Maybe a little.

He\u2019s operating in a country that\u2019s had a constitutional government for more than 200 years. And we\u2019re seeing the courts step up. We\u2019re seeing elements of the bureaucracy step up. Congress even occasionally steps up, for example, by passing Russia sanctions.

And the binary choice is either he backs down on things that he and his subordinates have said about, you know, that we\u2019re going to denuclearize the peninsula.

But he\u2019s going to have put-up-or-shut-up time coming pretty soon, where he\u2019s got to figure out is he actually going to pull out of it or not, and what are the consequences of pulling out of it. But beyond that, I think there is also going to be a moment of truth for him on trade, because, I mean, he has talked a big game on protectionism, and he hasn\u2019t followed through so far.

These are all things that he is clearly itching to do, and he has been restrained from doing in his first year.

It should hold Russia accountable for its illegal \u201coccupation\u201d of territory there, and push for international peacekeepers. Russian President Vladimir Putin bears the blame for this conflict in Europe, and he will be the \u201cdecision-maker\u201d on whether to end it too.", "At least, that\u2019s according to Ambassador Kurt Volker, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy charged with ending the war in Ukraine. If this sounds like a perfectly reasonable American policy toward Russia, that\u2019s because it is, and more or less one that either party would pursue. But of course, there\u2019s just one big problem with this: It almost certainly does not fully reflect what the president of the United States actually thinks.", "Story Continued Below", "In a new interview for The Global Politico, his first extensive one with a U.S. publication since taking on the post this summer, Volker talked at length about just how troubled relations are with Russia these days despite Donald Trump\u2019s hoped-for reconciliation, how the several rounds of talks he\u2019s held with a top Putin adviser have not yet made any progress, and what it\u2019s like to be a special envoy for a secretary of state who\u2019s vowed to get rid of them. ", "Overall, he said, prospects for peace are so dim he reckons", "it\u2019s very likely that active fighting will continue a year from now in Ukraine, which has been embroiled in military conflict since 2014, when Russia forcibly annexed the Crimean Peninsula, the first such takeover since World War II in Europe, and fomented a separatist war in eastern Ukraine\u2014leading to international condemnation and, ultimately, sanctions that Putin is desperate to lift.", "How likely?", "\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s at least 80 percent,\u201d Volker told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that there won\u2019t be, but the most likely scenario is that this continues,\u201d he added grimly, noting that more than 10,000 people in eastern Ukraine have been killed since the fighting broke out.", "To spend time with Volker is to confront the essential schizophrenia of the Trump administration\u2019s Russia policy. His version is what just about any U.S. administration\u2019s view of Russia and the Ukraine conflict would have been. And it\u2019s pretty much consistent with that of others inside the Trump administration with whom I\u2019ve spoken recently: deeply critical of Putin and certainly not swayed by him; concerned that little or no progress can be made on key issues and that the bottom in U.S.-Russia relations has not yet been reached after this past year\u2019s election hacking, tit-for-tat spying accusations, diplomatic expulsions and consulate closure.", "Volker said Trump himself is now on board with this version of his Russia policy, if only because Putin\u2019s moves have been so confrontational. \u201cRussia brings it on,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president always says: We would like to get along with Russia. But what Russia is doing makes it really hard.\u201d", "But of course, this Russia policy is still not exactly Trump\u2019s Russia policy. ", "Reminders of that come just about every day. Just a few hours before my interview with Volker, in fact, Trump had made a point of calling Putin, and the official readout of their more than hourlong conversation portrayed it as a wide-ranging discussion of Syria, Ukraine, North Korea, ISIS, the Middle East and Central Asia. The decision to speak with Putin drew literal groans from some administration Russia hands, given that it came the day after Putin had been photographed physically embracing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad during a meeting in Sochi, and Trump\u2019s statement about the phone call made no mention of any criticism toward Putin\u2019s backing of the Syrian regime or his recent decision to veto a U.N. investigation of the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.", "That did not seem accidental to anyone who has followed Trump\u2019s dealings with the Russian leader. Despite the entreaties of his staff and their views\u2014like Volker\u2019s\u2014that tend to be far more skeptical of the Kremlin strongman, Trump has never fully given up on his hopes of a friendly new era of Russian-American relations. On his recent trip to Asia, he even reignited the controversy over Putin\u2019s 2016 intervention in the U.S. presidential election, suggesting he believed Putin\u2019s denials\u2014over the consistent findings of the U.S. intelligence community. (The White House later clarified, unconvincingly, that Trump hadn\u2019t meant to suggest any such thing.)", "All of which puts Volker right in the unlikely center of the most contentious foreign policy fight of the Trump presidency.", "***", "There\u2019s no question that Volker, 52, is an unusual figure to have joined the Trump administration. His previous job was executive director of the institute started by Senator John McCain, perhaps Trump\u2019s harshest foreign policy critic within his party and a Russia hawk of long standing who has been particularly pointed about Trump\u2019s praise for Putin. And before that, Volker served in a key role working with U.S. allies to counter Russian aggression as ambassador to NATO for President George W. Bush, whose foreign policy Trump spent much of the 2016 campaign bashing as expensive and inept. ", "Still, Volker pointedly did not sign the letter from a vast array of mainstream Republican national security types disavowing Trump during that campaign. A few of those who did sign it tell me they are glad he is on the case and running what appears to be his own version of a Ukraine policy they can live with; their only question is whether he, and the others who share his views within Trump\u2019s administration, actually matter when it comes to making policy.", "Volker also has the questionable distinction of being the only special envoy actually named to the job by Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has come to office vowing to reorganize the department and eliminate dozens of separate special envoy positions like the one he just created for Volker. And in fact, Volker told me he has taken on the post only in a temporary, volunteer capacity, and that it was necessary because of the \u201cparticularly difficult transition\u201d that left the Trump State Department without any political appointee in place to deal with the Russians on Ukraine.", "When we spoke, Volker had just returned the previous week from a face-to-face meeting in Belgrade with a top Putin adviser, Vladislav Surkov. The session was their third, but Volker was blunt about what it accomplished: nothing. The talks, he said, were a \u201cstep back,\u201d with Surkov reverting to Russia\u2019s initial proposal in September to deploy United Nations peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine along the line currently separating Ukrainian government forces and the Russia-backed separatists. Surkov told reporters after the meeting that Volker had presented 29 separate paragraphs to the Russians and that Surkov had agreed with just three of them. ", "Either way, the meeting\u2019s failure speaks not only to the difficulty of making peace in Ukraine but also to the troubled state of the current U.S.-Russian relationship. ", "Just before the latest Ukraine talks, in fact, a new irritant had arisen: the failed effort to get Trump and Putin together during Trump\u2019s recent Asia trip. I had been told that the Russians were angry that Trump and Putin had not held a formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the recent summit meeting of world leaders in Asia and that the Trump White House had stumbled in both directions, first rejecting the idea of a meeting between the two leaders and then, when it was clear the Russians were unhappy about it, proposing at the last minute to add a Trump-Putin session only to have the peeved Russians reject it. In fact, the ill-timed Trump phone call with Putin right before my Volker interview had been in part a U.S. effort to smooth over those Russian concerns.", "In the interview, Volker seemed to agree that could have been part of the reason for why Surkov had seemed so intransigent at their latest session. \u201cOur third meeting, as you said, was a step back,\u201d Volker told me. \u201cThey went back to their original proposal again. I don\u2019t know what the next step after this is. It could be that that happened for completely other reasons having nothing to do with Ukraine, just where we are in our U.S.-Russian relationship. It could have had to do with the lack of a bilateral meeting between President Putin and President Trump.\u201d", "In general, I found Volker hardly puffing up the prospects of a grand peace settlement with Putin. He said he found Surkov a useful interlocutor, in that the Kremlin adviser clearly has the president\u2019s ear and comes in his capacity as a \u201cpolitical operative\u201d talking about a fundamentally political decision, not as some powerless functionary from the Russian Foreign Ministry. And he said there are \u201cglimmers\u201d of hope suggesting Putin might actually be ready to find a way out of the \u201cimpasse\u201d in eastern Ukraine, given that fighting has more or less stalled and Putin faces tough U.S. and European sanctions because of the Ukraine incursion.", "Volker insisted Putin could turn that around by cutting a deal now to end hostilities and bring in outside peacekeepers.", "\u201cBy invading the country and taking part of the territory, they\u2019ve produced a more nationalist, more Western-oriented, more unified Ukraine than ever existed before,\u201d Volker argued. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the opposite of what they wanted to produce, so it gives them a reason to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re not getting out of this what we wanted. It\u2019s costing us a lot to do it, both in a very specific sense of a military operation and civilian administration,\u2019 but it\u2019s also costing in terms of sanctions, their reputation, their relationship with the European Union, their relationship with the United States. So they might have an interest in resolving this.\u201d", "Still, to hear Volker\u2019s account is not exactly to listen to a conflict on the brink of resolution. Not only is Trump\u2019s personal commitment to pushing Putin and forging peace in Ukraine highly suspect, but Putin himself would seem to have little reason to take such action now\u2014especially with his own reelection looming in March 2018, and the conflict with Ukraine inevitably something that needs to be portrayed as a Russian success.", "Then there\u2019s the equally complicated U.S. side of the equation. ", "Volker and others inside the administration are clearly having to sell their mission to Trump too and not just the Russians. Their case to Trump goes something like this: You say you want better relations with Moscow. Well, that\u2019s not possible with the Russians still supporting a shooting war in Ukraine and subject to tough U.S. and European sanctions as a result. \u201cIf we are going to have any improvement in U.S.-Russia relations,\u201d Volker said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to stay where we are. We\u2019d like for this to be more constructive,\u201d and for that to be the case \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to see progress in Ukraine.\u201d", "Volker says Trump gets it. \u201cI know, having heard from the president directly on this, he wants to do this. He wants to make peace; he wants to see this resolved; he wants to see Ukraine get its territory back. It\u2019s crystal clear.\u201d", "The most pressing current issue that could well blow up Volker\u2019s talks\u2014and further erode Trump\u2019s hopes of improved relations with Putin\u2014are weapons sales to Ukraine. After months of internal debates, both the Pentagon and the State Department have reportedly recommended Trump approve a $47 million package of arms, including Javelin anti-tank missiles that Ukraine has heavily lobbied for. But Trump himself has not yet signed off and many Russia watchers believe he remains reluctant to do so; with the Russian presidential election looming and the fate of the Ukraine talks with Surkov still unclear, it\u2019s possible the U.S. may not act on the recommendation anytime soon. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any decision here,\u201d Volker said.", "Several sources have told me Volker has been a strong advocate for the arms sales, and he made clear in our interview that he supports the idea.", "\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything compelling that I can see as to why Ukraine should be a special case, why we wouldn\u2019t do that, especially when they\u2019re actively trying to defend their territory,\u201d Volker said, before walking through \u201cthe arguments that people made in the past\u201d and which \u201cI don\u2019t think hold a lot of water,\u201d from the prospect that sending advanced U.S. arms to the Ukrainians could actually backfire and cause an escalation in the fighting to the idea that it would embolden Ukrainians to keep fighting and refuse to come to the negotiating table. ", "I asked one veteran Russia hand, a former senior State Department official, what to think about those arguments. Volker, the former official said, is on the right side. But Trump\u2014as far as anyone can tell\u2014is not. ", "And what does that do to Volker\u2019s credibility with the Russians he\u2019s supposed to be negotiating with?", "You don\u2019t have to be a veteran Kremlinologist to know the answer to that one.

A veteran of nearly three decades in the CIA, Morell rose from within the ranks to become the agency\u2019s longtime deputy director, twice serving as its acting leader before retiring during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. In the summer of 2016, he broke with tradition to endorse Hillary Clinton over Trump, and he has continued to sound the alarm ever since.", "But in a revealingly self-critical and at times surprising interview for this week\u2019s Global POLITICO, Morell acknowledges that he and other spy-world critics of the president failed to fully \u201cthink through\u201d the negative backlash generated by their going political. \u201cThere was a significant downside,\u201d Morell said in the interview.", "Morell, who grew up as a superstar CIA analyst and eventually graduated to become President George W. Bush\u2019s personal daily intelligence briefer during the momentous events before and after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, was also reflective about the costs of the massive shift in emphasis toward counterterrorism after that attack \u2013 in particular, a failure to focus on the threat posed by a resurgent Russia under President Vladimir Putin until it was arguably too late.", "The Russian 2016 hacking, Morell told me, was in fact a U.S. \u201cintelligence failure\u201d in multiple ways. It was, he argued, at the least \u201ca failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11,\u201d with America\u2019s spy agencies apparently unable to have conceived of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and electronic hacking of Gmail being used to attack the country\u2019s election.", "But it was another kind of failure, too, Morell argued, of shifting money away from Russia and elsewhere in the name of fighting terrorism. \u201cAs we were trying to protect the country from terrorists,\u201d he said, \u201cwe became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost\u2026. When you make choices, you leave significant risk on the table.\u201d", "You can read the rest of our provocative conversation, which ranges from the internal debate over when Putin turned from frenemy to foe to whether Morell thinks Trump will ultimately be caught up in special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s net, below.", "***", " I\u2019m Susan Glasser, and welcome back to The Global POLITICO. I\u2019m delighted to tell you that our guest this week is Michael Morell, who has not once, but twice, been the acting director of the CIA and has emerged out of the shadows of the deep state, if you will, to become not only a very vocal public advocate for the intelligence community in these embattled times, but also something of a journalist and a creator of podcasts, as we\u2019ll talk about, I\u2019m sure.

Was there any particular sort of tipping point for you that made you think, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go public with this\u201d?", " ", " So, there were really two moments here, right, for me. One was when I first left government, I did a ", " interview about my life inside CIA, and it\u2019s something the agency thought that was a good thing to do, and I taped most of it before I left the agency. And I really liked it. And I, soon after that, joined CBS News as an on-air commentator on national security issues, and it resonated with me because I saw it in very similar terms to what I used to do for presidents. And I used to help--", " ", " And you were the guy who literally gave the presidential daily briefing to George W. Bush, before and after 9/11?", " ", " Correct. For the entire year of 2001. And then, I had been involved in the publication of the president\u2019s daily brief before that and after that. And of course, I briefed President Obama a lot when I was deputy director. ", " So, my fundamental job at the agency, as an analyst and then running the place, was to help the president think about the challenges we face in the world, right? And so, I saw my role on CBS, then, as helping the American people understand these incredibly complex challenges that we face. So, that was the first kind of public stepping out. ", " The second was in August of 2016, when I became political, when I endorsed Hillary Clinton with an op-ed in ", ", and that was a very difficult decision for me, because I had never been political before. I worked at this nonpolitical agency, bright red line between intelligence and policy, and intelligence and politics. So, I had never played that role before.", " But I was so deeply concerned about what a Trump presidency might look like from a national security perspective, and believed that there was such a gap between Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump with regard to how well they would protect the country, that I thought it extremely important to come out and say that.", " ", " Okay, so, flash-forward a year. Was that a mistake?", " ", " So, I don\u2019t think it was a mistake. I think there were downsides to it that I didn\u2019t think about at the time. I was concerned about what is the impact it would have on the agency, right? Very concerned about that, thought that through. But I don\u2019t think I fully thought through the implications.", " And one of the ways I\u2019ve thought about that, Susan, is\u2014okay, how did Donald Trump see this? Right? And from\u2014it\u2019s very important\u2014one of the things we do as intelligence analysts is make sure that our guy\u2014the president\u2014understands the other guy. Right? ", " So, let\u2019s put ourselves here in Donald Trump\u2019s shoes. So, what does he see? Right? He sees a former director of CIA and a former director of NSA, Mike Hayden, who I have the greatest respect for, criticizing him and his policies. Right? And he could rightfully have said, \u201cHuh, what\u2019s going on with these intelligence guys?\u201d Right?", " ", " It embroiders his narrative.", " ", " Exactly. And then he sees a former acting director and deputy director of CIA criticizing him and endorsing his opponent. And then he gets his first intelligence briefing, after becoming the Republican nominee, and within 24 to 48 hours, there are leaks out of that that are critical of him and his then-national security advisor, Mike Flynn.", " And so, this stuff starts to build, right? And he must have said to himself, \u201cWhat is it with these intelligence guys? Are they political?\u201d The current director at the time, John Brennan, during the campaign occasionally would push back on things that Donald Trump had said.", " So, when Trump talked about the Iran nuclear deal being the worst deal in the history of American diplomacy, and he was going to tear it up on the first day\u2014John Brennan came out publicly and said, \u201cThat would be an act of folly.\u201d So, he sees current sitting director pushing back on him. Right?", " Then he becomes president, and he\u2019s supposed to be getting a daily brief from the moment he becomes the president-elect. Right? And he doesn\u2019t. And within a few days, there\u2019s leaks about how he\u2019s not taking his briefing. So, he must have thought\u2014right?\u2014that, \u201cWho are these guys? Are these guys out to get me? Is this a political organization? Can I think about them as a political organization when I become president?\u201d ", " So, I think there was a significant downside to those of us who became political in that moment. So, if I could have thought of that, would I have ended up in a different place? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t think about. ", " ", " Well, it\u2019s very interesting, because of course, there are so many things you don\u2019t know at that moment in time, including, of course, I\u2019m sure you assumed, along with everybody else, that Hillary Clinton was likely to be elected, and you saw this as contributing to that in some way. But it\u2019s certainly relevant in the context of the situation we find ourselves in a year later. And, if it tends to embolden Trump in his critique of your former colleagues who are still serving in the intelligence agencies, and not only has this been a theme that he has struck repeatedly to criticize\u2014but also to politicize this.", " And inadvertently, perhaps, you or others who spoke out and have continued to speak out actually tend to underscore his feeling that there\u2019s a political divide, and now you and others are on one side of it, and potentially all your former colleagues, and then he\u2019s on the other side of it. ", " That was really underscored for me on his recent trip to Asia, when Donald Trump once again seemed to take Vladimir Putin\u2019s side on the issue of Russian intervention in the election over the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence agencies. But it was so revealing when they tried to fix it\u2014right?\u2014and he sort of said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m in favor of the current intelligence agencies, but not the former ones.\u201d", " ", " Yeah, and you can\u2019t pick and choose like that. And when people in the intelligence community\u2014particularly people in CIA, because for every other part of the intelligence community except CIA, you\u2019re working for a cabinet member. At CIA, you are working for the president of the United States. That is your customer. Right? ", "00:08:03 So, when you see your customer questioning what it is that you are providing to him or her, and that person seems to be cherry-picking what they accept and what they don\u2019t accept, it\u2019s demoralizing. And when it\u2019s demoralizing, people take actions, right? So, I live pretty close to the agency, and there\u2019s a coffee shop between me and the agency, and I\u2019ve met a number of agency officers in that coffee shop who have said to me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about leaving.\u201d ", " And my pushback to them is, \u201cYour country needs you now more than ever. Don\u2019t leave.\u201d Right? But it does lead people to question whether or not what they\u2019re doing is of value. And\u2014look\u2014working there is really hard. The problems are hard. They\u2019re complex. They\u2019re not easy to solve. Some of these targets where we\u2019re trying to collect intelligence are extraordinarily difficult. People operate in very dangerous places. The hours are long. The pressure on families is really tough.", " And so, if you think what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t matter, because the president of the United States is selectively listening, it has impact.

It\u2019s been reported that he\u2019s a leading candidate to potentially become secretary of state when Rex Tillerson leaves, which is the subject, of course, of a big Washington parlor game. ", " But Pompeo has personally been undertaking the presidential daily brief, by all accounts, as much as six days a week, he\u2019s leveraged that time with the president into a close relationship with the president. So, is that a normal role for the director of the CIA to be playing? Do you think that he has politicized the agency further by doing so?", " ", " I think that the relationship that Mike Pompeo has developed with the president is a very good thing. One of the most important things a director does is develop a relationship with the president that allows you to get your best information and your best analysis in front of the president. So, I actually believe that it\u2019s Mike\u2019s relationship with the president that has gotten the intelligence community and the CIA in the room almost every day of the week, and is getting them time, which gives the intelligence community\u2014Susan\u2014and the CIA the opportunity to tell the president what they think.", " And I think without that relationship that the two of them have\u2014which is why he\u2019s the leading candidate to replace Secretary Tillerson\u2014we might not be in the room at all. So, I think that is a very good thing. And one of the things that folks at CIA feel really good about is the fact that their director is getting them in the room every day.", " ", " Do you think the director is presenting objective, unbiased analysis of situations like the Russia situation or the Iran situation to the president?", " ", " So, I\u2019m not in the room.", " ", " No, I know.", " ", " Obviously, I\u2019m not in the room, but there\u2019s really three people in the room.

What I did for George Bush, there\u2019s a senior analyst who\u2019s doing that for President Trump. He\u2019s the one who actually does the briefing, and Mike Pompeo and Dan Coats, I would bet, do the color commentary, right? That\u2019s the way it worked with me and George Tenet. I was the play-by-play guy and George Tenet was the color commentator. ", " I\u2019m absolutely certain\u2014because I know the person who\u2019s briefing\u2014I mean, I grew up with that person, worked with that person, have a hundred percent confidence that that person is presenting the intelligence in a nonpolitical, nonpartisan, nonpolicy manner. What Mike Pompeo might say, or Dan Coats might say is\u2014no idea. ", " But I believe the views of the intelligence community are getting across. Whether the president is accepting them or not is really hard to say.", " ", " Well, his public statements indicate that he\u2019s not accepting them, at least in certain critical areas.", " ", " On certain cases, yes. Russia, for example.", " ", " Russia. Okay. So, let\u2019s talk about Russia. Dana Priest\u2014a terrific journalist whom you know\u2014just wrote a very critical and very interesting piece in ", "and she said Russia was an intelligence failure, the Russian intervention in our elections. That\u2019s not really the widely accepted narrative, but I thought it was a powerful piece. Do you agree with that?", " ", " So, she had a couple of different themes, right? And I\u2019d say charges, right? One was the intelligence failure. One was you didn\u2019t brief Congress soon enough, right?", " ", " Right.", " ", " On what you did know.", " ", " And then there\u2019s the question of the social media piece, and basically\u2014", " ", " Right. So, let\u2019s deal with just the intelligence failure piece. I think this is a legitimate question to ask. And I look at it from two perspectives. One, in the intelligence business, we think about warning in two ways: strategic warning\u2014Al Qaeda wants to attack us in the United States, right? And tactical warning: they\u2019re going to attack us next week using this method, right? Those are two different kinds of warning. ", " So, I have little doubt that we, the intelligence community, didn\u2019t see from a strategic sense this particular\u2014and I\u2019m talking about social media here, the weaponization of social media\u2014that we did see that coming. Susan, I went back and looked at all of the unclassified versions of the worldwide threat testimony that the DNI and the director of the agency and the director of DIA give every year, and I read all of those.", " I reread all of those. There\u2019s a cyber section in every one, right? And the warnings are about\u2014", " ", " I remember Panetta, right? \u201cThe danger of a cyber Pearl Harbor.\u201d", ": Right. \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d right. Attack on our infrastructure. I didn\u2019t see anywhere in there\u2014and this was criticism of myself, right, because I was deputy director of the CIA until August of 2013\u2014I didn\u2019t see anywhere in those worldwide threat testimonies a warning about the possible use of social media to attack us. So, I think it\u2019s a legitimate question. ", " And on the tactical question, my question is, when\u2014and I don\u2019t know the answer this\u2014my question is, when did the intelligence community see the Russians messing around with social media in the election?", " And my question\u2019s there because you remember the DNI\u2014the Director of National Intelligence\u2014and the Secretary of Homeland Security put out a public statement\u2014", " ", " On October 7.", " ", " Exactly. And it said two things. Right? The Russians used cyber to steal stuff from the Democratic National Committee and from John Podesta\u2014Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager\u2014and gave the embarrassing stuff to WikiLeaks, right? Which then used it against the secretary.", " And then, two, tried to get into voting systems in the states. It didn\u2019t mention anything about the use of social media to spread and amplify fake news. And so, I wonder, did they know about it at that point? Or did they not know about it at that point?", " ", " Well, you know, it\u2019s very interesting you raise this, because I think they didn\u2019t. Because I did a very interesting interview of The Global POLITICO with Jim Clapper, who was the DNI at the time, who was the signatory, or was the issuer of that statement, along with Jeh Johnson\u2014who I also interviewed on The Global POLITICO\u2014I asked Clapper\u2014this was quite recently, this fall\u2014\u201cWhat have you learned that you didn\u2019t know before the election?\u201d What have you learned from the disclosures that are coming out publicly, or in testimony and the like as this Russiagate investigation unfolds?", " That was what he spotlighted for me, in our conversation. Just this fall he said, I learned the extent to which they were active on these platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which was not something I really was aware of. And I thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty amazing. He was the Director of National Intelligence.\u201d", " Morrell: You know what\u2019s interesting is, if that\u2019s true\u2014and it certainly sounds like it is, based on your conversation with Jim, who is a wonderful man and is the best DNI that we\u2019ve ever had, in my view\u2014if that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s a failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11. Right?", " ", " That\u2019s right. And, by the way, another part of Dana\u2019s critique is relevant here, which is the blind spot, or the failure of imagination at a time when we\u2019ve invested literally billions of dollars\u2014you know far better than I do\u2014since 9/11, in our collection capabilities, in actually operationalizing the CIA, turning them into a fighting force; giving them capabilities you could have only dreamed of. ", " Are we too busy, basically, looking at satellite images of tanks when Facebook is the new Fulda Gap?", " ", " Let me say two things. One is, there\u2019s a little bit of a danger in\u2014and I\u2019m correcting myself here a little bit\u2014a little bit of a danger in overemphasizing the failure of imagination, which is an analytic thing. Right?", " ", " Correct.", " ", " So, it\u2019s a useful critique of analysts. But the other important players here are intelligence collectors, right? So, the failure to see this coming, and the failure to take some time before you actually see what\u2019s happening is also a collection failure. It means you haven\u2019t penetrated the right places with the right assets\u2014CIA and NSA are the two big ones here\u2014to tell you exactly what the Russians are doing. So, it\u2019s a couple of important failures there. ", " The other way to answer your question, Susan, is that post-9/11, there was a huge flow of resources to counterterrorism. Not surprising. I mean, we moved hundreds of people internally. The collection resources were focused on counterterrorism. CIA got back into the paramilitary business in a way that it hadn\u2019t been since the Office of Strategic Services days during World War II. ", " All understandable, but with the implication that we moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia. So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost. ", " One of the things I\u2019d like to point out is that\u2014the CIA\u2019s a large place and the total number of employees there is classified, but to put it into perspective for you, in 1991 we had x employees. By 2001\u201410 years later\u2014we had .75x, so a 25 percent decline. When I walked out the door in 2013, even with a significant ramp-up in resources post-9/11, we only had 1.1x. So, essentially the same number of employees in 2013 as we had in 1991, in a world that was much, much more complex, with many, many more issues.", " How do you cover all of that in the way you have to to protect the country? And the answer is, you can\u2019t. Right? You\u2019ve got to make choices. And when you make choices, you leave significant risk on the table. ", " ", " So, do you think that in making choices, we underestimated Russia and its return under Vladimir Putin?", " ", " I think yes. Right? I think in the early Putin days as president, and then certainly when Medvedev was president and Putin was prime minister, Russia was not what it is today. We were interacting with them in a much more normal way\u2014we being the United States and Europe. It was only when Putin came back the second time as president, that the behavior started to turn, and turned significantly back towards what was essentially Russian behavior during the Cold War, which is challenge the United States everywhere you can in the world, and do whatever you can to undermine what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. Do whatever you can to weaken them. ", " They\u2019re being extraordinarily aggressive with regard to that. And that was a change. That wasn\u2019t Vladimir Putin from day one. ", " ", " Well, that\u2019s very interesting you make that argument. My husband and I were stationed in Moscow during Putin\u2019s first term in office, and then back here for the second term of Bush\u2019s presidency on forward. And there\u2019s a real debate, I would say, among Russia hands about that argument that you just made. That\u2019s very interesting to me, because Russia did invade Georgia in 2008, before Putin returned officially to the presidency.", " And I think the Obama White House arguably staked its Russia policy on the view that you are expounding, that somehow Russia was more amenable to us, and then with Putin\u2019s return to power, that it changed in some marked way. ", " I\u2019m not sure that I agree with that, but it\u2019s interesting that you take a definitive position on it.", " ", " I think there\u2019s a debate, but I feel pretty comfortable with the position I\u2019ve taken. I think Georgia was a turning point. I think Georgia was a really important moment, and maybe that should have been the wakeup call, you know, that moment where he was willing to invade a neighbor. ", " ", " And also, what lessons he took or didn\u2019t take from that Western response to that.", " ", " Or lack of Western response to that, right? ", " ", " Yes.", " ", " Absolutely.", " ", " I think so. To me, that\u2019s a very key moment.", " ", " And, the two things we just talked about go in parallel, right? And are reinforcing to each other. So, he takes an aggressive step and he doesn\u2019t get any pushback; he doesn\u2019t get anything to deter him. Right? And that\u2019s been the history of this relationship, in my view, since Georgia. Right? Is, he does something that is damaging to our interests or the interests of our allies, and there\u2019s not a response, and so he keeps going, and he keeps going, and he keeps going. ", " ", " So, this is endlessly interesting to me to talk about Putin, but I want to cast it into the present a little bit more. So, he keeps going; he\u2019s not only invading Ukraine, but much more aggressive in intervening in the elections, for example, of other countries on the periphery of Russia and Eastern and Central Europe, aggressive measures against neighbors in the Baltics, for example, in Estonia.", "00 And so, that\u2019s where you get this argument from many of my Russia-hand friends that, of course, this wasn\u2019t something new, to intervene in the United States, and it\u2019s exactly what he did in Poland, or in other countries. So that\u2019s one bullet point on the question of our intelligence. ", " The other question is, did we do things to kind of unilaterally disarm from an intelligence point of view, on Russia?", " ", " Well, I think Russia was one of the places that suffered from the loss of resources as they flowed to counterterrorism\u2014no doubt in my mind. There were things with regard to Georgia, for example, that I can\u2019t talk about specifically, but things we could not tell the president about what was happening in Georgia at the particular time that they were doing what they were doing because we had turned off systems that used to be turned on, because now they were focused on other parts of the world. Right?", " ", " The eye had turned.", " ", " So, absolutely, that suffered. I think\u2014and there were also things that we were doing as a country that he was misreading\u2014Putin was misreading. So, I talked earlier about the importance of an intelligence officer being able to tell the president, \u201cHere\u2019s the other guy\u2019s view.\u201d Well, what\u2019s Putin\u2019s view of us? Right?", " Putin\u2019s view of us is that we want to undermine him, and that we are actively working to do so. Right? He really believes that. And he points to things that are absolutely true. The State Department pushing for democracy in Russia openly. And then he points to things that aren\u2019t true, like the CIA was behind the street protests in Kiev that led to all the problems in Ukraine. Right? ", " That\u2019s his worldview, is that we are trying to undermine him, and that we want him to go away, right? And so, when you think about it in those terms, what he\u2019s doing against us\u2014right? It\u2019s kind of interesting, right? It doesn\u2019t justify what he\u2019s doing, but it certainly puts it in perspective.", " ", " No, I think that\u2019s a great point to make, and I think it\u2019s so important. So, Russiagate? Or whatever we want to call it. I don\u2019t know if you have a better name for it than that. Based on your intelligence analyst hat, looking at the dots that are out there\u2014how do we construct a narrative around them that makes sense? Is there enough information to construct a narrative? What do you make of the evidence that\u2019s public, recognizing that it\u2019s a very small amount of the evidence, presumably?", " ", " The best place to start is with a caveat, is I have no insight into the FBI investigation or the two investigations being done by the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate. So, this is really me being an analyst, looking at everything that\u2019s available, right?", " The first thing I\u2019d say is that there may be a benign explanation for all of this. What might that be? The benign explanation is that Vladimir Putin, understanding who Donald Trump was as a person, understanding how narcissistic he is, played to Donald Trump by saying he was a great guy\u2014right? Had the potential to be a great leader, et cetera, et cetera. ", " And Trump responded exactly the way Putin wanted him to by reciprocating, right? Great leader, et cetera, et cetera. Right? Maybe what he did in Ukraine and Crimea was all right. Who are we to say? You know, Putin\u2019s killed all these people, but so do we. You know, try to put this in perspective. Right? All of these things that Trump said could have been simply in response to Putin playing him, and playing his personality. ", " You know, when all that happened, of course, the media and the Clinton campaign jumped all over Donald Trump, right?\u2014and said, \u201cBoy, look at what this guy\u2019s saying,\u201d right? \u201cThis is inconsistent with the world in which we live in.\u201d It is possible at that moment, that Steve Bannon and Steve Miller and Sebastian Gorka walked into Trump\u2019s office in Trump Tower and said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re being criticized for what you said about Putin and Russia, but, boss, you\u2019re right. Right? You\u2019re absolutely right, and let us give you the intellectual context in which to think about this. And the intellectual context in which to think about it is, we actually need Russia as a partner, to push back against the two biggest threats that we see.\u201d", " ", " Right. China, yes.", " ", " Bannon, Miller and Gorka. China and Islamic extremism. And, Russia, a white, Christian country, fits\u2014", " ", " Their worldview.", " ", " Their worldview. Right? So, Putin might have played him, and then Bannon gives him an intellectual framework to say, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Keep talking about this.\u201d So, that is the totally benign view.", " Am I open to the possibility that there is a malign view? Absolutely. I don\u2019t discard that. I\u2019ve been criticized by some people on the left for saying I don\u2019t see any evidence here of a crime. I still don\u2019t see any evidence of a crime. It doesn\u2019t mean there is any. I just don\u2019t see it.", " ", " Including evidence of obstruction of justice?", " ", " So, let\u2019s talk about what I think the possibilities are, going forward. So, I would not be surprised if Bob Mueller concludes that the Trump campaign did not violate the law with regard to its interactions with the Russians. I\u2019m really open to that possibility. Why? Because, as you know, ", ", every media outlet that is worth its salt has reporters digging into this, and they haven\u2019t found anything.", " And I think that, had there been something there, they would have found something. And I think Bob Mueller would have found it already and it would have leaked. ", " So, I\u2019m really open to the possibility that there\u2019s no there there on a crime being committed by the campaign and the Russians. Right? That interaction leading to criminal charges.", " The second point I\u2019d make is that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were single individuals who were associated with the campaign who violated the law with respect to their interactions with the Russians on the election. Paul Manafort comes to mind. I think he has little to no integrity. There\u2019s no way you spend that much time with the old Ukrainian government and not bump up against Russian intelligence officers a lot. ", " I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were single individuals who faced criminal charges here with regard to their interactions with the Russians, and Paul Manafort\u2019s a possibility. But that\u2019s different than a conspiracy by the campaign, right? ", " The third thing I\u2019d say is, every FBI investigation that I\u2019ve ever had visibility into or been involved in, the people who they\u2019re looking at actually don\u2019t end up getting charged with the crime they were being investigated for. They get charged with something else. Right? And that something else in this case could be the laundering of Russian organized crime funds. And if that was done by the Trump organization\u2014if that was done knowingly\u2014it\u2019s a criminal violation. ", "If it was done unwittingly, because you didn\u2019t do the due diligence that\u2019s required under U.S. law for where the money is coming from, from overseas\u2014it\u2019s a civil penalty. And the Trump organization gets fined. What the politics of all that is, I have no idea. That\u2019s the third thing I\u2019d say.", " The fourth thing I\u2019d say is, the obstruction of justice issue. In my view, when I read the statute, boy, it looks\u2014you know, it looks like you could make a case. Now, the hard part is intent. Right? You have to intend to violate the statute. You have to intend to obstruct justice. That\u2019s the difficult piece to prove here. ", " You need something on paper, or you need somebody who heard the president say something about what he was trying to do here, or you need him to tell you that. Right? Well, he\u2019s not going to do that. And so, while it looks like it to all of us, that that\u2019s what he was trying to do\u2014you\u2019ve got to get to that intent part, and that\u2019s what\u2019s hard from a criminal perspective.", " ", " So, well, it goes to Donald Trump\u2019s state of mind, which is the other question I would ask you, with your intelligence analyst hat on. If you were the presidential daily briefer for Emmanuel Macron, or Vladimir Putin, for that matter\u2014what would you tell that president about our president?", " ", " What I would say is\u2014you know, I worked for 33 years at CIA. I watched a lot of foreign leaders. There\u2019s a spectrum of narcissism among human beings. Right? ", " ", " Foreign leaders often\u2014leaders have a lot of it.", " ", " Leaders of any country, right? They have a lot of it. Right? They are one or two standard deviations to the right of the mean. President Trump is no different from that, and in fact, he might be three or four standard deviations out. Right?", " So, what I would say is, \u201cPlay to his narcissism. Play to his narcissism.\u201d I think some leaders have done that exceptionally well. I think Prime Minister Abe of Japan has done it. I think Xi Jinping has done it. I think Macron has done it. There are some leaders who simply can\u2019t bring themselves to do it, like Angela Merkel. She just\u2014bless her heart\u2014she can\u2019t bring herself to do it. ", " But, play to his narcissism. Tell him he\u2019s great. Tell him you want to help him. And then leave the details of the policy to your ministers. Right? So, from ministers to U.S. Cabinet officials, leave the details. Don\u2019t talk about details with the president, just\u2014", " ", " Pretend you agree. Well, is it narcissism? Is it something more than that, though? Do you believe there\u2019s some sort of an impairment?", " ", " I don\u2019t know. I think narcissism itself is an impairment. Right? ", " ", " Speaking of\u2014by the way, the mental state of people\u2014there\u2019s been a little bit of a controversy this year about Kim Jong Un and whether the United States government assesses him to be crazy in some way, or a rational actor.

Right? And I felt when I was in the job of deputy or acting director that I needed to answer it with a national security answer. So my answer was always terrorists with nuclear weapons. Right? That\u2019s what keeps me up at night. And it still does. I still worry about that.

And so, another interesting data point.", " ", " We don\u2019t know why she\u2019s leaving, right, but that would be an example of getting worn down to the point where you lose somebody of Dina\u2019s talent, worldview, perspective, that is consistent with, in my view, the right worldview, that the U.S. has to play a leadership role in the world\u2014that maybe she\u2019s gotten worn down.", " ", " Well, not to mention the fact, I have to say, every time I look at a picture of a Trump meeting with a major foreign leader, especially like in the Middle East, Dina\u2019s the only woman at the table. Always. Always. And so, who knows what that would be?", "So, a final thought as we leave this really stimulating and interesting conversation. We\u2019ve been pretty Russia-focused today, but I do love that you\u2019ve jumped on over to the side of the fence and after three decades in the most secretive and closed organization in the United States, you are now a host of your own podcast. You\u2019re a public commentator. You\u2019re a journalist. What\u2019s it like to be on the other side of the First Amendment?", " ", " I believe deeply in the role of the media. I just finished watching Ken Burns\u2019 ", " The Vietnam series\u2014I\u2019m halfway through.", " ", " I think it should be required watching for every American. Right? And what you see when you watch that is multiple presidents not only making the wrong decision, but actually lying to the American people. And the role of the media in making transparent the decisions the government is making and why they\u2019re making them is extraordinarily important to our democracy. And it is very, very important that that Fourth Estate be vibrant and strong, very, very important.", "And I\u2019m worried about that a little bit. My college son a few months ago sent me an email and said, \u201cDad, you need to read this book on Hugo Chavez.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou need to read it because the parallels between Chavez and Trump are striking.\u201d So I got the book and I read it. And there\u2019s some parallels, and there\u2019s some similarities, and there\u2019s as many differences, I thought. But there was something that really struck me, and it has to do with the media business.", " And what struck me was that, when Hugo Chavez first got elected there was no political opposition. It had faded away. There was no opposition leader to stand up and paint a different future for Venezuela, one that challenged Chavez\u2019s future. And, as a result of there being no political opposition, the Venezuelan media became the political opposition. And in becoming the political opposition, it lost all of its credibility with the Venezuelan people. Sound familiar?", " Yes.", " ", " So, I think that as important as the media\u2019s role is here\u2014and it\u2019s probably more important today than it ever has been, given where we are\u2014the media has to absolutely make certain that they are playing this straight. Right? And that they aren\u2019t taking sides in any way. ", " ", " You know, I\u2019m so glad you brought this up, and I think this is a very powerful point.

A year into his tenure, Trump\u2019s foreign policy remains as unpredictable and at times capricious as the man himself. \u201cPredicting Trump,\u201d deadpanned Dennis Ross, a longtime adviser on the region to presidents in both parties, \u201crequires more humility than anticipating developments in the Middle East.\u201d", "Even when it\u2019s clear what his advisers support and how they have counseled him, the president has repeatedly shown willingness to balk at their plans\u2014or to make his own policy declarations by Twitter fiat, as he seems to have done already several times in just the first few days of 2018, on subjects as varied as aid to Pakistan and the Palestinians and nuclear talks with North Korea.", "It hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention as it should amid the national debate over Trump\u2019s fitness for office occasioned by the publication of a scathing new insider book, but the story of Trump\u2019s Iran policy is a great example of how the president\u2019s willingness to flout the counsel of his own team can land him in a foreign policy mess, or exacerbate an existing one.", "Last year, both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis advocated that Trump remain in the Iran nuclear deal and attest to Iranian compliance with its terms. Both pointed out that nothing in the deal stopped Trump from taking tougher action on Iran outside the narrow terms of the arrangement, which is meant to halt the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But in October, Trump overruled them\u2014while leaving his actual policy an ambiguous quagmire. That\u2019s because he \u201cdecertified\u201d the deal and yet did not pull out of it, saying he would try to work with Congress and European allies to force new conditions on Iran.", "But little progress has been made with Congress or European nations, a broader policy review on how to counter Iran across the Middle East has still yet to be rolled out, and in the meantime, Iran has emerged as among the first genuine foreign policy tests of 2018.", "Over the holidays, a wave of protests broke out across the country, marking the most widespread public dissent in the Islamic Republic since the 2009 Green Movement that erupted after presidential elections that spring returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. Now, amid an ongoing crackdown that has seen mass arrests and at least a couple dozen protesters killed, Trump has publicly tweeted support for the dissenters. At the same time, his advisers have been meeting privately to try to figure out how to deal with the protests and the awkward timing problem: This coming Friday\u2019s congressionally mandated deadline for Trump either to once again certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal and waive sanctions, or follow through on his tough rhetoric and move forward with blowing up the deal, painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration with Iran and five other world powers.", "\u201cPrediction: Waivers will be issued, decertification will be made again,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a key outside adviser to the Trump administration on Iran. Like others, he expects a move on Capitol Hill for new legislation revisiting the deal as well as additional sanctions to punish the Iranian government for its latest crackdown, and the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was consulting last week with the White House on what language would look like.", "But Washington in the age of Trump is no longer certain of its judgment, or the predictive instincts that come from watching presidents of both parties up close grapple for decades with the dilemma of Iran. \u201cI saw a senior official just yesterday who still had no idea what Trump would do,\u201d a former top U.S. government adviser on Iran told me.", "\u201cThe real test comes this week,\u201d says Suzanne Maloney, a leading Iran expert who worked on the State Department policy planning staff in the final two years of the Bush administration and for ExxonMobil during Tillerson\u2019s tenure as its CEO. \u201cMy sense is that what\u2019s happening inside Iran plays directly into the narrative that consumes at least those who are advising Trump, which is that one can\u2019t do transactions with an inherently evil entity, and that fundamentally the problem is not about the nuclear program or about Iran\u2019s involvement in Syria or other places in the region. Fundamentally, the problem is the nature of the regime.\u201d", "\u201cAnd so, to the extent that the president hears that view echoed from Iranians on the streets, it may harden his perception and potentially tempt him to take very disruptive action,\u201d Maloney tells me in a new interview for The Global POLITICO, our weekly podcast on world affairs. \u201cI think it would be a big mistake, but that will be something that we\u2019ll have to contend with.\"", "***", "If Trump\u2019s foreign policy is unpredictable, events inside Iran have historically been even harder to predict. The Iranian Revolution in 1979 was so unexpected that the CIA famously concluded in an analysis just days before that the shah\u2019s regime was secure and nowhere near a \u201crevolutionary\u201d state. During the Bush administration, Maloney remembers, she waged a lonely, \u201ctearful\u201d battle to contradict her colleagues and present then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with an analysis predicting Ahmadinejad\u2019s initial presidential victory. Then Ahmadinejad won\u2014and Washington was surprised all over again by the reformist backlash to him that came a few years later.", "So it wasn\u2019t exactly shocking when this latest wave of protests inside Iran also erupted without anticipation, either to the government in Tehran that has seemed slow to respond or to those in Washington charged with making policy. \u201cWe never learn the lesson,\u201d Maloney says. \u201cWe are persistently surprised by developments in Iran.\u201d ", "Perhaps the real surprise is the incredible persistence and bravery with which thousands of Iranians have defied the conventional wisdom in Washington, and elsewhere, that the theocratic rule of the ayatollahs is stable and, four decades in, largely unchallenged. \u201cThe frame that many on both sides of the aisle here in Washington have had for some time is that Iran is fundamentally a stable place, that Iranians prefer evolution to revolution. They want democracy; they want change; but they\u2019re not willing to risk their lives and livelihoods on the streets,\u201d Maloney points out. \u201cThat may, in fact, characterize well the majority of Iranians. But, it certainly doesn\u2019t characterize the thousands who\u2019ve gone to the streets over the course of the past few days. So, humility is something we all have to keep in mind with respect to Iran.\u201d", "Someone who knows all too well about Iranian bravery in the face of repression is Maziar Bahari, the Iranian-born journalist and filmmaker who joined Maloney on this week\u2019s Global POLITICO. Bahari had returned to Tehran to cover the 2009 election and subsequent protests for ", " and the BBC; when protests over alleged vote-rigging broke out, he stayed to cover them\u2014then found himself dragged off to prison, where he was tortured and beaten in a failed effort by government interrogators to get him to confess he was part of a Western plot to instigate the uprising.", "Bahari, who chronicled his ordeal in a best-selling book ", " later made into a film by Jon Stewart, argued in our conversation that the latest demonstrations in Iran\u2014while \u201cthey have puzzled everyone in Iran and outside of Iran\u201d\u2014ought to represent a recognition that the government is much less stable than it might seem, that it will face such protests whenever there is even a bit of space for such demonstrations to occur. \u201cThe regime, the Iranian government, might be able to suppress the protest for a few days, maybe a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years,\u201d he says, \u201cbut because of these protests, unemployment, corruption, the ineffectual Islamic system that has been Iran for the past 40 years\u2014these will not go away. And as a result, people will come to the streets and demonstrate any time there is a measure of space.\u201d", "Though he understands them well by now, he has little patience for the often partisan and parochial political debates that tend to shape Washington\u2019s response to events inside Iran. In D.C., the fight over the last week has been dominated largely by pronouncements from the Trump administration\u2014including by the president himself and a toughly worded op-ed in the Washington Post by Vice President Mike Pence\u2014vowing not to make the mistake Obama did in 2009 and fail to voice strong public support for the protesters. Several former officials who supported Obama in 2009 in that decision have publicly renounced it this week, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as Ross and Maloney, who says it was a mistake to have been \u201cabdicating responsibility.\u201d", "Bahari remembers what it was like on the streets of Tehran when the protesters\u2014unlike today\u2019s group, a largely Westernized, urban elite\u2014realized Obama was not going to stick his neck out for them.", "\u201cWhether we like Mike Pence or not; whether we like Donald Trump or not\u2014they are president and vice president of the United States. And as such, Iranian protesters, Iranian people like to hear from them,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember being in the streets of Tehran in 2009, when millions of people came to the streets and were demonstrating peacefully, and they wanted their votes to be counted. And it was really disappointing for them not to hear from President Obama at that time.\u201d", "Besides, Bahari added, \u201cbeing anti-American is in the DNA of the Iranian government\u201d and they would go on to accuse the United States of fomenting those 2009 protests anyway\u2014which was, after all, what his interrogators were trying to get him to \u201cconfess.\u201d \u201cSo, whether the Americans are quiet or vocal or screaming, it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re going to accuse their opponents of being stooges of Americans and Israelis and the British.\u201d", "As he spoke, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of those protesters who had been arrested over the last week. Many will be tortured and beaten as Bahari was. Some will undoubtedly be forced to confess how they worked with Westerners to destabilize the regime.

It turned out to be White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon, not yet banished from Trump\u2019s inner circle, had a surprising story to tell the wonky scholar of American foreign policy: Mead, he said, was the reason President Andrew Jackson\u2019s portrait now occupied a controversial place of honor in Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office.", "Story Continued Below", "Bannon had seized on Mead\u2019s work as part of his war on the other factions inside Trump\u2019s White House, and especially the hyperentitled family members like son-in-law Jared Kushner and \u201cglobalists\u201d like national security adviser H.R. McMaster he viewed as selling out Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision to the more conventional course preferred by the Washington establishment. In the rumpled Mead and his writings about the \u201cJacksonian\u201d tradition in American foreign policy, Bannon saw a populist kindred spirit\u2014and a suitably rabble-rousing model for the anti-establishment course he hoped Trump would follow.", "Trump agreed, which is why the Jackson portrait went up and the president was visiting Old Hickory\u2019s Tennessee home within weeks of his inauguration, never mind the instant outcry that greeted Trump\u2019s embrace of a slave-holding, Native American-fighting early 19th century predecessor as his role model. \u201cThat\u2019s what Steve Bannon told me,\u201d Mead recalled in a new interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs. \u201cThere was this Jacksonian moment.\u201d", "Even now, exactly a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead says that while Bannon has been purged from the White House, Bannonism\u2014and by extension the bowdlerized, 21st century version of Jacksonianism he was peddling\u2014has not. If you want to understand Trump\u2019s otherwise incomprehensible presidency, Mead argues, you need to understand America\u2019s seventh president.", "\u201cThe Steve Bannon side of the Trump presidency remains very Jacksonian. Bannon isn\u2019t in the White House, and he\u2019s not welcome I think, but his influence is still felt,\u201d Mead says. \u201cTrump\u2019s base remains Jacksonian. And Trump knows how to play to this base. So even as Trump has kind of adjusted in some ways to the necessities of the Washington establishment and, you know, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t just completely reinvent American foreign policy,\u2019 he continues to orient in this way.\u201d", "After all, Mead notes, Bannon may be gone, but as for the president, \u201cHe still has a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in the Oval Office.\u201d", "***", " it wasn\u2019t just Steve Bannon who took a newfound interest in Andrew Jackson\u2014and Walter Russell Mead. Suddenly, old copies of Mead\u2019s 2001 book, ", ", were being pulled off shelves by those who hoped to understand Trump, and Mead\u2019s essays in places like ", " and ", " and columns in the ", " were soon required reading among those Republicans, like the young hard-liner Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who sought to advise Trump and harness his message of economic nationalism and deep skepticism of immigrants and internationalists. (\u201cInsights that have stood the test of time,\u201d Cotton said of Mead, recommending his book to listeners of The Global Politico last fall; the two have become so close that Mead attended Cotton\u2019s 40th birthday party last spring.)", "For Washington\u2019s political class, Mead provided an answer to explain the otherwise perplexing populist appeal of the brash billionaire. Jacksonianism, as Mead viewed it, was exactly the historical precedent to explain Trump, marrying grass-roots disdain for elites, deep suspicion of overseas entanglements\u2014and obsession with America power and sovereignty. \u201cHe is not the second coming of Andrew Jackson,\u201d Mead said when we talked on the eve of Trump\u2019s first anniversary in office this weekend. \u201cBut there was such a hunger in America for a Jacksonian figure that people were willing to project a lot of qualities onto this sort of very unlikely Queens real estate developer who becomes the folk hero of Americans who hate New York and are suspicious of Big Business.\u201d", "In explaining the historical antecedents for Trump\u2019s hostility toward free trade, establishment-bashing and embrace of a certain kind of chauvinist nationalism, Mead offered an intellectual framework to understand Trump at a time when others remained simply mystified by the president. Indeed, Mead found Trump\u2019s antagonism toward the fundamentals of the post-Cold War international order; rejection of alliances and allies; and visceral disregard for international institutions and the robust free trade made possible by it all perfectly consistent with the attributes of Jacksonianism he had first described more than a decade earlier.", "For \u201ca scholar of foreign policy,\u201d says Mead, who is today a distinguished fellow at the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute, watching Trump\u2019s rise was sort of an out-of-body experience, a once-in-a-career moment \u201cwhere these abstract typologies that you write about suddenly seems to be happening in front of you.\u201d", "Jackson is one of four American historical figures Mead sees as archetypes of American foreign policy\u2014but, like Trump today, he has historically been far from the mainstream. Ever since World War II, Mead argues, politicians coming from the more idealistic, democracy-promoting, free-trade-worshiping ranks of Wilsonians and Hamiltonians have reigned over Washington. Jacksonians and more libertarian-minded Jeffersonian realists have largely been relegated to the sidelines, or reluctantly enlisted in foreign adventures when they seemed justified by the bigger ideological struggle against communism in the Cold War.", "But with the Cold War over, that liberal internationalist approach finally flopped with the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Mead argues, giving Trump the political opening he seized. Bush and his neocons \u201chad little to no real success,\u201d Mead says, with their Wilsonian project of using American power to build a more democratic Middle East. Obama, while more cautious about democracy-building, got sucked in too, leaving \u201cwreckage\u201d abroad and dismayed voters at home. \u201cThe gap between the establishment predictions about where the world would go and then the reality of where the world is opened a gap that enabled Trump basically to run as the little boy saying the emperor has no clothes,\u201d Mead says.", "The problem, however, is that Trump was hardly prepared to govern\u2014which has largely been the story of his first year in office. \u201cHe ran essentially on a negative agenda, that the establishment didn\u2019t know what it was doing. And his proposals tended to be pretty vague and often contradictory,\u201d Mead says. \u201cSo, yeah, now he has the difficulty of, you know, \u2018How do you govern?\u2019 This is always the problem for populism: Once you\u2019re in office, what do you do?\u201d", "Trump\u2019s embrace of Jackson as a governing philosophy has been decidedly controversial. To critics, it\u2019s barely veiled racism, a signaling to Trump\u2019s overwhelmingly white political base that is hardly subtle considering Jackson\u2019s rapidly declining historical reputation. A slave owner and general once celebrated as the conquering hero of the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson is perhaps better known today as a fighter against Native Americans whose tactics were so brutal that the Obama administration announced in 2016 it was booting him from the $20 bill. When Trump recently hosted Native American leaders in the Oval Office and pictures circulated of them standing with the Jackson portrait in the background, Twitter was filled with commentary about the president\u2019s boorish slight of his guests.", "In our interview, Mead acknowledges the \u201cxenophobic\u201d side of Jacksonian populism and says that it has often been a \u201cwhites-only\u201d political movement, but he argues most mainstream scholars\u2014and politicians\u2014have made a mistake by seeking to condemn this key segment of the electorate rather than trying to understand it. \u201cAmerica wouldn\u2019t be a democracy without Jacksonian populism,\u201d Mead says, arguing that it is Jacksonians who tend to fight and win America\u2019s wars, regardless of how enthusiastic they are about starting them. \u201cIn its more negative moments, you can call it xenophobic. And yet somehow the health of our democracy historically has rested in many ways on exactly this sometimes quite problematic strain in American politics.\u201d", "Even now, a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead argues that many establishment types remain confounded by Trump and his erratic approach to foreign policy because they continue to ignore the political imperatives demanded by his Jacksonian base. For example, Mead argues that Trump\u2019s tough talk about the world and penchant for appointing top advisers from the ranks of former generals doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he will end up as a more militaristic president than others, but should be seen as effective political appeals to a base that respects the military more than other American institutions and sees the outside world as a source of threat and fear rather than opportunity.", "\u201cAndrew Jackson\u2019s actual foreign policy was a lot less inflammatory than his rhetoric. And I think Trump, for one thing, understands that Jacksonians like for America to sound tough. They don\u2019t like long, grinding wars, inconclusive wars. And, in fact, they would rather not fight wars unless America is attacked,\u201d Mead explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s logical in a way and it builds to his base for Trump to take a tough line, but he\u2019s been rather cautious about where does he actually commit troops and how much war is he willing to get into.\u201d", "Then again, Mead acknowledges, Trump\u2019s approach to the world really has been confusing during his first year in office\u2014at least in part because many of the president\u2019s top advisers, like McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Defense Secretary James Mattis, don\u2019t seem to share it.

On the other was Samantha Power, Obama\u2019s activist, human rights-minded ambassador to the United Nations, concluding eight years in the White House and in Turtle Bay", "of often futile pushing for more action to take on the planet\u2019s most intractable challenges.", "It was a \u201chuge fight,\u201d Rhodes recounts, \u201ca long debate about how bad this moment is.\u201d", "Rhodes and Obama wanted an upbeat speech. Power, however, wanted to sound the alarm about a world in crisis.", "\u201cOur perspectives are just fundamentally different,\u201d Power argues, a blunt acknowledgement of the gulf that separated Obama\u2019s team on some basic questions by the end. \u201cMy world is a world where we have 65 million displaced, Yemen and Syria and Iraq, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Burundi, South Sudan, Darfur, Afghanistan of course, Venezuela imploding. ... There are concerns about terrorism, there is a fear of the other, and all the trends on democracy, right now at least, are going in the wrong direction.\u201d", "Obama recognized the many afflictions still plaguing parts of the world that his successor would later dismissively call \u201cshithole countries.\u201d But to Obama, the world he would be leaving to his successor was, on the whole, more peaceful and less violent than it had ever been, and Power\u2019s objections notwithstanding, that is exactly the speech he gave the day after their argument. \u201cThe president is saying \u2018Right now, for all these problems, this is actually the best time to be alive in human history,\u2019\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cI think she felt as if that was potentially discordant with the mood.\u201d", "The fight in September 2016 is disclosed for the first time in a new documentary on the Obama foreign policy team that is being released this week, and it reveals an administration that by its final days was deeply conflicted on how to address persistent challenges like the ongoing Syrian civil war and found itself profoundly shocked and unprepared for the upset victory of Donald Trump just a few weeks later. The HBO film, \u201cThe Final Year,\u201d by documentarian Greg Barker, stars Rhodes and Power, who represented two opposing poles inside the Obama administration over the uses and limits of American power to shape events around the world\u2014a running battle between idealism and pragmatism that is, in the end, subsumed by their shared horror and dismay over Trump\u2019s election. ", "In Barker\u2019s telling, Trump\u2019s coming victory in the latter half of the film has something of a horror movie quality, as the blustery New York billionaire makes a few cameo appearances throughout a year of remarkable backstage access to the president and his top advisers, usually when Rhodes is dismissing any chance that Trump will win. The film\u2019s denouement, of course, is that election\u2014captured in a memorable scene at Power\u2019s New York apartment when she throws a party for all 37 female ambassadors to the U.N. as well as feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to celebrate what they all expected to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s inevitable victory. Instead, the night ended in tears, with Power\u2019s sleeping 4-year-old daughter sprawled across her lap \u201clike a pale, Irish statue.\u201d Recalling the party more than a year later, Power ruefully tells me, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of bad ideas in my life, though none as immortalized as that one.\u201d", "The normally voluble Rhodes, meanwhile, left literally speechless by the outcome, is shown sitting alone outside in the night as he repeatedly tries to come up with something to say to the camera that had followed him all year, and failing, for once, to find the right words\u2014or any words at all. When I asked him about it, he said that at the time it felt like he could offer nothing other than a \u201clame rationalization\u201d for why Trump had won. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said when we talked, \u201cthings are just terrible.\u201d", "That surprise ending to 2016 is really the starting point to the debate we\u2019re still having more than a year later: How do we evaluate Obama\u2019s legacy in the world when he appears to have been so politically repudiated at home, and the ultimate fate of so many of his signature diplomatic achievements, from the Iran nuclear deal to the Paris climate accord and Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, is now cast into doubt? Did Obama\u2019s missteps\u2014or even the failure of Obama and his aides to understand the rise of Trump\u2014somehow pave the way for a successor who has little in the way of fixed foreign policy principles except to emphasize how different they are from Obama\u2019s?", "After a year in office, in fact, perhaps the most reliable guide to Trump\u2019s unpredictable presidency may well be his oft-stated preference for doing exactly what Obama would not or could not on foreign policy. Consistent with his campaign rhetoric, Trump has withdrawn from the TPP and the Paris agreement and, just last week, once again refused to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, giving Congress and U.S. allies in Europe a deadline of May to revise its terms or he will abandon it altogether. Whenever he talks publicly, Trump seems to delight in Obama-bashing, and his foreign policy speeches are replete with references to the terrible hand he was dealt by Obama and the many mistakes of the predecessor he has said will go down in history as \u201cthe worst president ever.\u201d", "Given all that, it\u2019s fascinating and more than a bit awkward to listen to Power and Rhodes, in a joint interview for the new Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs, try to come to terms with the explosive consequences of Trump\u2019s presidency on all they spent eight years working for. Both are scathing when it comes to Trump\u2019s turn away from specific Obama priorities like the TPP, the Iran deal and the opening with Cuba that Rhodes personally negotiated, as well as what they see as his administration\u2019s broader attack on the international institutions, promotion of democratic values and Western alliances that have been at the heart of both parties\u2019 foreign policies since the end of the Cold War.", "\u201cWhat Trump has done is in some ways not surprising. He\u2019s partially rolled back Cuba, he\u2019s pulled out of Paris, he\u2019s threatened to kill the Iran deal but not done it. But what\u2019s been worse to watch, I think, is underneath that, the hollowing out of the State Department, the defunding of all the types of programs that Samantha and I fought to get money for \u2026 the kind of unseen elements of American foreign policy that underpin the liberal international order, that\u2019s where the year has been much worse than I imagined,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cI anticipated him taking aim at some of our legacy accomplishments, but it\u2019s more this disavowal of an entire approach to the world.\u201d", "For her part, Power sees Trump as the antithesis of Obama when it comes to foreign policy: \u201cholding our allies in contempt, ripping up international treaties, showing our word means nothing, and then demanding that people do what we say.\u201d She says Trump is \u201cjust draining money from the bank, with needless insults and gratuitous steps away from things that really seem derived more from a formula of how can we do the opposite of what Barack Obama did, than even a considered, coherent approach.\u201d", "She also has a few tough words for Trump\u2019s embattled secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. \u201cCan anybody articulate what our current secretary of state is trying to achieve in the world, beyond the number of jobs he\u2019s trying to cut at the State Department?\u201d Power told me. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d", "It is hard to disagree with any of this criticism, and yet I came away thinking they had still not fully come to terms with Trump\u2019s win\u2014and what their own \u201ccomplacency,\u201d as Power put it at one point, might have had to do with it.", "Rhodes had memorably spent much of the Obama presidency casting himself and the president he served in the role of scourge of the Washington foreign policy establishment, blaming them for decades of pointless, unsuccessful interventions in the Middle East, including, but not limited to, the Bush administration\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq. In a long New York Times Magazine ", " of him released in 2016, Rhodes dismissively called them \u201cThe Blob,\u201d and cast the Obama foreign policy challenge as one of repudiating their conventional wisdoms. But of course, Obama started out castigating Washington for many of the same policy failures that Trump would eventually blame on him, and the film ends with Obama acknowledging in a speech to veterans that he is the first U.S. president ever to serve two full terms in office with the country at war.", "So did The Blob look any better to Rhodes now, I asked, with Trump seeking to blow up both parties\u2019 settled beliefs about foreign policy? Perhaps he and Obama were closer than they thought to the Washington mainstream. And besides, I noted, many of the hawkish, national security-minded Republicans whom Rhodes once disdained have formed the core of the #NeverTrump resistance from within the president's own party. ", "Sure, he allows, \u201cThe Blob and I have more in common than some people might think\u201d\u2014even if he sticks to his view of the Iraq war as a foreign policy disaster that flowed from a Washington whose default setting is to advocate military intervention in response to foreign policy challenges. At least, as he put it to me, both the hawks of the George W. Bush administration and the doves of the Obama administration \u201cwere all for the liberal international order.\u201d ", "***", "If Trump\u2019s looming victory\u2014and the obliviousness of the protagonists to this impending catastrophe\u2014is the haunting theme of the film, Syria is its agonized subplot.", "Power made her name as a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of an account of the Balkans genocide, \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d and she describes herself as tormented and sleepless over the Obama administration\u2019s failure to stop the fighting in Syria. She fought and lost numerous battles inside the Obama White House over Syria, pushing efforts to arm Syrian rebels from early on and for more explicit U.S. military intervention\u2014steps Obama resisted throughout. Instead, Secretary of State John Kerry, a Power ally in the internal disputes, is shown in the film fruitlessly meeting over and over again with the Russians, the outside power that did choose to intervene, in a pointless effort to negotiate a peace in Syria before time runs out on the Obama administration.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no issue that we\u2019ve worked on where there\u2019s such a divergence,\u201d Power says at one point in the film. \u201cCertainly what is happening in Syria is beyond frustrating. There\u2019s no issue where my thoughts and ideas have made such a marginal impact on desperate people.\u201d", "Here her split with Obama and Rhodes was an enduring one. Rhodes had started out as an advocate of doing more in Syria as well, but by the end says he adopted Obama\u2019s view that the U.S. could do little to influence the outcome of a conflict that, while tragic, was ultimately not in the American national interest to try to resolve by force of arms. Not only that, but Rhodes said in our interview he thought Obama had even made a mistake by this standard in continuing the ongoing war in Afghanistan\u2014a conflict that is now in its 17th year to which President Trump has recently decided to send still more troops in essentially an open-ended commitment.", "\u201cI have to apply that lesson to everything,\u201d Rhodes told me, \u201cand I feel like there are diminishing returns about what we are accomplishing in Afghanistan.\u201d", "It can be hard even to have such a second-guessing conversation for the two Democrats amid the bigger disruptions of the Trump presidency. Their fights with each other were real and significant, reflecting enduring divides within their own party and the American public about the uses and abuses of American power. But Trump, with his crude portrayal of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d at home and a Darwinian world abroad abounding with bad deals, untrustworthy allies and scammers trying to take advantage of our generosity, has made that debate awfully hard to publicly surface.", "When I asked Power and Rhodes about the September 2016 fight recounted in the film over how optimistic a final speech Obama should present to the United Nations, for example, they were both struggling to fit it into today\u2019s context, the Trump context.", "\u201cHow do you meet the reality\u2014the negative reality in the world\u2014without actually becoming Donald Trump?\u201d Rhodes asked. \u201cYou can overstate the troubles in the world in a way that actually suits the Trumps of the world.\u201d", "Power had disagreed at the time, but now she and Rhodes did not seem so far apart after all.", "Recalling their fight, she said, \u201cHow do we meet people where they are, with that fear that we know that has been generated, in part by lies, and by our politics, but in part by actual legitimate fear and events, and how do we meet them where they are without indulging that fear, and without giving in to that cynicism, and that darkness?\u201d", "It was a good question, even if it was clear that we do not yet know how to answer it.

Still, he insists there are glimmers of hope that could be converted into a course of action by Republicans in Congress.

The conservative Daily Caller website even reported he had not won the job because the looks-obsessed new president considered him of insufficient stature for the post (though another site pointed out that Corker, at 5\u20197\u2019\u2019, is in fact the same height as Vladimir Putin).", "\n                            Bridget Mulcahy/Politico", "Regardless of the real reason he didn\u2019t get the nod, Corker, like many Republicans, disagrees strongly with Trump on key foreign policy issues.

A case study: Just last week, newly sworn-in Secretary of State Tillerson brought his choice for deputy, veteran Republican foreign policy hand and well-known neocon Elliott Abrams, to the White House to have him meet Trump for an appointment that seemed settled. According to several sources with whom I\u2019ve spoken, the Abrams choice, pushed by both Tillerson and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been held up for weeks by objections from Bannon \u2013 and was ultimately nixed by the president after Trump was reminded of Abrams\u2019s critical statements about him during the campaign.", "As for the national security adviser, many in the Washington foreign policy world \u2013 in both parties \u2013 have been deeply suspicious of Trump\u2019s reliance on Mike Flynn, the hawkish anti-Iran and seemingly pro-Russian former general whose potentially improper pre-inauguration discussions with the Russian ambassador are being investigated. But the establishment has worried not only about his Russia ties but also his fundamental competence and fitness for the job, blaming him for contributing to the disarray and confusion of the administration\u2019s early days with a lack of clear staffing and organization and a paranoid culture in which professionals are being kept out of key national security decisions.", "Still, Corker met with Flynn at the White House a few days before our interview and came away with a different view than he expected.

Bush\u2019s national security adviser during the tumultuous period of the end of the Cold War. \u201cIt\u2019s not what people thought, where he was going to be an autocrat,\u201d Corker adds, seeing early signs of Flynn \u201ctaking input\u201d from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Tillerson and \u201ccreating a real interagency process.\u201d", "But then again, Corker, like the rest of us, doesn\u2019t really know yet.", "\n                                            ", "\n                                        ", "\n                                            By ", "That becomes clear once again when we turn back to the question of Iran.

", "During Nixon\u2019s administration, I had been a member of the Cabinet as counselor to the president, among other roles, and", "one of the Nixon-led Cabinet meetings still remains vivid in my mind.", "Fresh from his historic triumph in 1972, in which he\u2019d won 49 out of 50 states, Nixon entered the Cabinet Room to rousing cheers and an extended standing ovation. But rather than enjoying the moment and expressing warm appreciation to his team, Nixon began a meandering yet colorful lecture with seemingly no clear point. He spoke of various British prime ministers and other men he admired, tossing in unusual comments, like, \u201cRichard Nixon doesn\u2019t shoot blanks\u201d and noting that Winston Churchill\u2019s father was a \u201cbrilliant man whose career was ruined by syphilis.\u201d Then he mentioned \u201cexhausted volcanoes,\u201d a phrase he said British politician Benjamin Disraeli had used to describe public servants drained of their energy and inspiration. ", "Story Continued Below", "As the session ended, Nixon exited the Cabinet Room to far more muted applause and a few confused looks as to exactly what had just transpired, leaving his powerful chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, to promptly\u2014and without preface\u2014ask each of the Cabinet members to tender their resignations in case the president chose to accept them. Moreover, Haldeman asked each Cabinet member to provide summaries of their responsibilities that could be helpful to whoever might replace them. I wasn\u2019t asked to resign but departed the Cabinet later, when Nixon asked me to serve as ambassador to NATO. That was the post I later took on when I came back to Washington right after Nixon\u2019s resignation to help my friend, Ford, with his whirlwind transition.", "At his first Cabinet meeting, Ford behaved in a completely opposite fashion of his predecessor. He thanked all of the Cabinet members who were there\u2014each of them were obviously Nixon holdovers\u2014for their service and then said he was counting on them to stay on. Going further to make his point absolutely clear, he said he would not accept any resignations that might be tendered. Of his predecessor, Ford expressed a surprising level of admiration and affection. In his first speech to the nation, he had closed by asking his fellow citizens to pray for Nixon and his family: \u201cMay our former president, who brought peace to millions, find it for himself.\u201d ", "But it was that very question\u2014how to bring peace to the long and bitter political battles of Watergate, which had been tearing the nation apart\u2014that soon dominated the administration. While Ford made clear at his first Cabinet meeting that any talk of a pardon for Nixon should not be discussed publicly, the idea clearly was on his mind. Those of us close enough to observe it ourselves could see how tormented Ford was by the decision. And when he finally made it, it caught many of us by surprise and even led to angry outbursts from people inside the administration, at least one of which I found myself on the receiving end of.", "On August 9, 1974, the day Ford had been sworn in, aides to Leon Jaworski, then the special prosecutor in the Watergate case, had drafted a memo weighing the pros and cons of prosecuting Nixon. \u201cIn our view,\u201d the memo argued, \u201cthere is clear evidence that Richard M. Nixon participated in a conspiracy to obstruct justice by concealing the identity of those responsible for the Watergate break-in and other criminal offenses.\u201d The memo continued: \u201cThere is a presumption (which in the past we have operated upon) that Richard M. Nixon, like every citizen, is subject to the rule of law. Accordingly, one begins with the premise that if there is sufficient evidence, Mr. Nixon should be indicted and prosecuted. The question then becomes whether the presumption for proceeding is outweighed by the factors mandating against indictment and prosecution.\u201d ", "The main arguments the aides cited in favor of Nixon\u2019s arrest, indictment and prosecution were: the \u201cprinciple of equal justice\u201d; that the country would remain divided without a final disposition of charges; that the lack of action might encourage a future president to commit acts of lawlessness; and that a resignation alone might not be \u201csufficient retribution\u201d for such criminal offenses. Among the factors cited that weighed against arrest, indictment and prosecution were: that the embarrassment and disgrace associated with resignation would be punishment enough; that prosecution would \u201caggravate\u201d the nation\u2019s divisions; and that pretrial publicity might make it hard, if not impossible, for Nixon to receive a fair trial. ", "From the outset, Ford indicated that he was sympathetic to the latter view. He knew a trial of a former president would not only be unprecedented, but also would reopen wounds and divisions over the Watergate scandal. Ford had asked White House counsel Phil Buchen to inquire of Jaworski just how much time a criminal prosecution would take. Jaworski responded that, with various legal considerations, it would be at least nine months before Nixon was even brought to trial. Then the trial itself, if it were to take place, would last an indeterminate amount of time, and could conceivably lead to additional unsavory revelations about the Nixon administration. It would surely be a protracted, drama-filled affair in which there would be very few, if any, \u201cwinners.\u201d Also driving Ford were the questions from the members of the media at his first press conference, which had taken place on August 28. Ford had prepared to field a wide variety of questions, from the pending negotiations with the Soviet Union on a nuclear arms agreement to the precarious situation in Cyprus. Instead, his encounter with the White House press corps was dominated by inquiries about Nixon and Watergate. Was this, Ford later asked an aide, what he was going to face every time he met with members of the media? ", "There was also a human element to consider. Ford, as noted, had made no secret of his sympathy for his longtime friend, who was in declining health, by some reports both mentally and physically. At the White House, we received periodic reports that the former president was despondent over his predicament. Kids were throwing what was euphemistically referred to as \u201cdog dirt\u201d\u2014actually dog excrement\u2014from the beach onto Nixon\u2019s property in San Clemente. Pat Nixon, too, felt under siege in the community. \u201cShe disappeared from public view,\u201d noted historian David Lester, \u201csecluded behind the high walls and impenetrable trees and shrubbery of the 5.9-acre estate where they had gone to live.\u201d Ford heard disturbing reports that Mrs. Nixon needed to wear wigs and disguises just to go out shopping. Adding to his problems, Nixon, soon after leaving office, suffered a blood clot in his leg, a painful ailment that he had experienced on other occasions. As his situation deteriorated, a physician who had examined Nixon advised reporters that the former president was \u201ca ravaged man who has lost the will to fight\u201d and characterized his condition as \u201ccritical.\u201d Nixon had never been known to pay much attention to his health, Ford, the former football player and excellent athlete, once mentioned to me. As a result, Nixon, who had been a workaholic, didn\u2019t have much reserve to rely on when he needed it. To Ford, pardoning Nixon was what he believed was the humanitarian\u2014and the Christian\u2014thing to do.", "On September 8, 1974, Ford delivered a 10-minute address to the nation, which he believed, or at least hoped, would put the Watergate scandal firmly in the past. It was a bit after 11 a.m. and was preceded by Sunday services at St. John\u2019s Church across Lafayette Square from the White House. From behind the Wilson desk and with thick, gold curtains and the leafy South Lawn as the backdrop, the president spoke to the nation in a calm, deliberate tone. \u201cI have learned already in this office that the difficult decisions always come to this desk,\u201d he began. Trying to get ahead of criticism about the timing of the decision\u2014one that came before Nixon had even been charged with a crime\u2014he said, \u201cTo procrastinate, to agonize and to wait for a more favorable turn of events that may never come or more compelling external pressures that may as well be wrong as right, is itself a decision of sorts and a weak and potentially dangerous course for a president to follow.\u201d Of the Nixon family, Ford said, \u201cTheirs is an American tragedy, in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that and, if I can, I must.\u201d ", "In Ford\u2019s mind, Nixon had not gotten off scot-free. Ford had come across a 1915 Supreme Court case, ", ", which ruled that a pardon carried an \u201cimputation of guilt,\u201d and, therefore, accepting a pardon was, as such, \u201can admission of guilt.\u201d For a time, to justify his stunning decision, Ford kept a clipping of the Burdick case\u2019s ruling in his wallet. ", "At the White House, \u201cangry calls, heavy and constant\u201d began jamming the switchboards. Throughout the rest of Ford\u2019s presidency, fomented by Nixon critics in the media, where they were thick in number, suspicion about the circumstances surrounding the pardon lingered. A whopping 71 percent polled by Time magazine believed then that Ford may not have told the country the whole truth about the circumstances of the pardon. ", "Many Republicans were angry at Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, and for not being truthful or forthcoming with those who had supported him. Had I been in Washington, D.C., and had Ford asked my opinion about a possible pardon, I\u2019m not sure what I would have counseled. That October, after I came back to the White House in my new position as his chief of staff, Ford expressed to me his interest in calling an ailing Nixon, who had been in the hospital. I argued against the call, telling Ford that I understood his sympathy for his predecessor but that Nixon had misled the American people regardless of his concern for what\u2019s right and wrong\u2014and I noted \u201che had damaged hundreds of human beings by betraying them. Further, he betrayed the goals that all of them were working for.\u201d I said that I personally had felt angry and betrayed. Ford listened carefully to this, and while he might have been caught off guard by my reaction, he certainly understood it.", "The president didn\u2019t call Nixon that evening. With his reputation hurt and the credibility of the presidency once again badly damaged, the president\u2019s already formidable hurdles to getting the country back on track became extraordinary. And despite Ford\u2019s completely honorable intentions, the ghosts of Watergate did not depart as easily or quickly as he had hoped.", "Ford\u2019s justification for his pardon decision also was coming under continuing scrutiny, buttressed by new reporting. Wildly inaccurate allegations, suspicions and rumors persisted of an alleged secret deal supposedly brokered by Al Haig, whom Ford had since nominated to serve as supreme allied commander in Europe, once he had left his post as White House chief of staff. In one major newspaper, Haig was quoted as warning Ford in late August that a pardon was essential to avoiding \u201ca personal and national tragedy\u201d\u2014an allusion to the possibility of a complete physical breakdown by Nixon. Ford\u2019s former press secretary Jerry terHorst claimed publicly that Ford spent too much time \u201cplacating the sensitive feelings\u201d of Haig, who was allegedly pushing for a pardon. ", "\n                            Click here to buy the book.", "For his part, Haig was justifiably angry that his conduct and integrity were being put into question. Shortly after I succeeded Haig as chief of staff, he telephoned me from his new post in Belgium in a heated mood. \u201cThis is going to get dirty,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll blow the place wide open if I have to and it\u2019ll be a goddamn bloody mess and no more of these second-rate people around the president are going to challenge my integrity and devotion to my country.\u201d ", "Haig, who had talked to Nixon regularly since Nixon\u2019s resignation, gave me, and in effect asked me to give Ford, the ominous-sounding warning that \u201cI\u2019ve got Nixon, [Leonard] Garment, [J. Fred] Buzhardt, [Ron] Ziegler and others with me and I\u2019ve got verbatim records and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I had no idea what he was talking about when he referenced this cast of Nixon advisers and lawyers. My guess was he thought the Ford forces, particularly Bob Hartmann, were trying to hang him out to dry unfairly, and he wanted Ford to know he wasn\u2019t going to put up with it. ", "Ford had his own view of what Haig might have been concerned about. He told me that when Nixon offered him the vice presidency in the Oval Office, Haig was present and that that meeting was probably taped. He indicated that Nixon had told Ford that John Connally, the former Texas governor whom Nixon deeply admired, would be his choice for the 1976 nomination. In that meeting, Ford apparently had agreed to support Connally, who at the time had become mired in an ethics investigation. The whole discussion, in which Nixon had in effect said another person would be a better candidate for president than the man he\u2019d just picked as vice president, might prove a little embarrassing if it was later revealed publicly. ", "In any event, I finally said to Haig, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve taken enough of this.\u201d Haig had always been friendly and cordial to me, and I understood he was agitated. I told him bluntly that I didn\u2019t want to get into the subject and that I thought he ought to talk directly to Ford. The unusual outburst from Haig seemed to be a sign of how much the pardon issue still hung, to use Ford\u2019s words, like a dagger over the White House, as well as the considerable stress Haig had been under. To make absolutely clear he had nothing to hide and nothing to apologize for, Ford agreed to the most unusual step of testifying before Congress as a sitting president. ", "Ford\u2019s bold, continuing efforts to pull his administration out of the Watergate thicket was a lingering frustration for him, particularly in that his new administration faced so many pressing national concerns\u2014foreign crises, arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and a sluggish economy that had begun to worsen. But he had already made the decision that would place an indelible mark on his presidential legacy, a sacrifice that risked his own future in order to salvage the nation from one of the most painful and divisive periods in our history. Yet as hard as Ford tried to exorcise the ghost of Watergate, it would continue to linger for the rest of his presidency.

", " ( ", ") ", " \u201cFor political junkies and those who just want to catch up, the Sunday shows still are relevant, but they\u2019re not the signature events they once were,\u201d Tom Brokaw, the NBC News veteran who briefly moderated \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 2008, said in an interview. \u201cI first appeared on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 during Watergate, and it was a secular mass in Washington; the faithful never missed it.\u201d ", " Political veterans, congressional aides, former administration officials and longtime journalists all attested to the Sunday shows\u2019 decline. The programs are no longer the agenda-setting platforms of days past, they said. Instead, the broadcasts have become a venue for lawmakers to push familiar talking points and for talking heads to exchange conventional wisdom. Occasionally there is an interview or discussion that will make headlines \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s endorsement of gay marriage, which preceded President Barack Obama\u2019s own announcement, comes to mind. But that has become the exception rather than the rule. ", " Not surprisingly, the few who adamantly insist that the programs are relevant are the hosts and producers. ", " \u201cI do not agree that \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 is not what it has always been, which is a driver of the conversation,\u201d said David Gregory, the current host, echoing remarks made by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos and CBS\u2019s Bob Schieffer. \u201cAdministration figures, politicians and candidates come to \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 because they know what \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 represents.\u201d ", " Increasingly, what \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and its competitors represent are still-powerful brands struggling to maintain influence in a radically changed media environment, where news consumption is more fast-paced and fractured than ever and \u201cthe news cycle\u201d these shows used to command no longer really exists. ", " ( ", ") ", " Since the death of former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Tim Russert in 2008, there has been much hemming and hawing over the quality of the Sunday show hosts, none of whom have a reputation for tough interviews. Gregory has particularly suffered in the press; on Monday, The Washington Post Style section published what amounts to the latest installment in the host\u2019s rolling public relations disaster under the headline, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With David Gregory?\u201d ", " Gregory doesn\u2019t put much stock in the criticism, saying, \u201cIf I could figure out why certain perceptions existed, I wouldn\u2019t have time to do my job.\u201d ", " But complaints about the hosts overlook a dire reality, which is that the changed media environment has dealt a severe blow to the Sunday institution itself. In an era of 24-hour news delivered through digital snippets, the historic influence of the weekend morning shows may now be irrecoverable. ", " The Obama administration has turned an especially cold shoulder to the programs. Past administrations would dole out key newsmakers almost every week. The George W. Bush administration frequently sent the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others on the show in an effort to shape the national conversation. ", " \u201cWhen I was at the White House and on the Hill, Sunday shows were either the exclamation point at the end of a week or the capital letter that began a new week. Today, they\u2019re part of the endless dot, dot, dots that are part of political coverage,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary. \u201cThere is so much news and so many outlets, even quality Sunday shows don\u2019t break through like they use to.\u201d ", " Journalists recognize the change as well. ", " \u201cThe news cycle moves so quickly and with so many diverse entry points for quality political news that it is difficult for the Sunday shows, as they once did, to \u2018drive\u2019 the week\u2019s political news,\u201d Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times, wrote in an email. \u201cA week is now eternity, after all.\u201d ", " That reality has radically altered the way politicians use the Sunday programs. In the past, the platform was so influential that presidential administrations and lawmakers met nearly every week to strategically plan out appearances, hoping to impact the latest political or policy debate. ", " ( ", ") ", " \u201cThere was a time when everything would stop on Friday afternoon and Cabinet members and senators would gather around a table and say, \u2018Who are we putting out on Sunday?\u2019\u201d one former Democratic White House official said. \u201cNow if you want to make news, you can tweet it, or you can call any number of outlets.\u201d ", " The options for influencing the news today are numerous: A politician can go on cable news, give a newspaper interview, stop by talk radio, hold a press conference or simply send out a tweet. And he or she can do any of those things on a Tuesday night or a Friday afternoon. The news will invariably percolate up the media chain \u2014 from the Twitter-chattering press corps to the front pages of leading news sites \u2014 and become fodder for next Sunday\u2019s roundtables. ", " Lacking for willing participants, the shows increasingly serve as a home for party spokesmen who seem to relish the national limelight. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) made a combined 38 appearances across the three shows in 2013. ", " Meanwhile, other lawmakers understand that while the Sunday shows are still a powerful platform, reaching a combined 9 million to 10 million viewers a week, they are no longer essential to their messaging strategy. ", " \u201cA generation ago, people would go on Sunday shows because they thought it would set the tone for the week,\u201d said Alex Conant, the press secretary for Sen. Marco Rubio, who has made two appearances so far in 2014. \u201cWhen we go on Sunday shows, it\u2019s more to talk to a big audience in a thoughtful way, rather than to generate Monday morning headlines.\u201d ", " That the Obama administration has been less proactive on Sundays may be a unique feature of this White House \u2014 \u201cthis president hasn\u2019t made great use of his Cabinet,\u201d the former White House official said \u2014 but it is also a byproduct of the new media environment. Obama\u2019s team has always put a premium on direct-to-voter messaging and, when it does do national media, often favors going outside the Beltway. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

I have to be me.\u201d ", "But Fabrizio, who couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, is more than a pollster, according to those who have worked with him and marveled at the accuracy of his surveys and messaging. Steve Schale, a longtime Florida strategist and Obama campaign adviser, says Fabrizio\u2019s a bad hire \u2014 for Democrats. ", "\u201cTony is flat-out one of the smartest dudes I know. He proved it with Rick Scott \u2014 much to my personal detriment, he knows how to take a deeply flawed candidate and sell them to the voters,\u201d Schale said. \u201cIf I was a Republican running for president or dogcatcher, I\u2019d want him in my corner.\u201d ", "\n                    ", "\n                    By ", "In hiring Fabrizio, a Fort Lauderdale resident, Trump has access to Florida\u2019s most sought-after Republican pollster and adviser. If Trump loses Florida, he more than likely loses his shot at the White House. Considering the high stakes and high quality of Fabrizio\u2019s work, his hiring by the Trump campaign was seen as a no-brainer. ", "\u201cThis is the best deal Trump ever made,\u201d said Chip Englander, former campaign manager for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, for which Fabrizio polled earlier this year. \u201cTony is a superstar.\u201d ", "Unlike many Republicans, Fabrizio refrained from taking direct personal shots at Trump during the primary. ", "Still, when he worked for Paul in August 2015, he poked fun at Trump\u2019s bad numbers with Hispanics and chided statistics guru Nate Silver on Twitter by saying: \u201cHow dare you question the power of the great Donald of Oz???\u201d He also praised a George Will column in The Washington Post that bashed Trump. ", "After Paul dropped out, Fabrizio began advocating Trump\u2019s candidacy on Twitter. ", "Like Trump, Fabrizio knows how to leverage controversy by playing rough. He was one of the masterminds behind the infamous Willie Horton ad that portrayed Democrat Michael Dukakis as soft on crime in the 1988 presidential election against George H.W. Bush. ", "\u201cWe knew people would go crazy,\u201d Fabrizio told the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times in a 2011 interview. \u201cThe networks had wanted to throw us off air, but we already paid them $1 million to run the ad. How many hundreds of millions of [dollars in] free air time did we get?\u201d ", "In a twist, Fabrizio in 2011 told Trump he wouldn\u2019t work on his presidential campaign if he ran in 2012. Fabrizio, courted by other campaigns, worked for Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s presidential campaign instead. ", "Over the decades, Fabrizio has worked for presidential candidates Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Perry and Paul; for former Sens. Connie Mack of Florida, Alfonse D\u2019Amato of New York and Bob Bennett of Utah; and for former Govs. Bob Riley of Alabama, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mike Foster of Louisiana. He has also advised the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and numerous political committees. ", "\n                    ", "A Brooklyn native, Fabrizio grew up on Long Island and now lives near another transplanted New Yorker, fellow political operative Roger Stone, a top Trump associate and backer whom Fabrizio met in 1978. Through Stone, Fabrizio met Trump adviser Paul Manafort in the 1990s, and the two have worked together on numerous projects. Manafort began advocating Fabrizio\u2019s hiring soon after he joined Trump\u2019s campaign in March. ", "As Manafort was hired, Stone was coming back into the Trump campaign\u2019s good graces. In August, Stone parted ways with the campaign when it refused to hire a pollster. Trump didn\u2019t need a pollster after all; however, the tycoon\u2019s general-election prospects have necessitated beefing up his team. ", "While working for Trump, Fabrizio will stay on DeSantis\u2019 Senate campaign, according to DeSantis\u2019 Senate campaign manager, Brad Herold, who called Fabrizio \u201cone of the smartest minds in Republican politics.\u201d Brian Hughes, campaign manager for one of DeSantis\u2019 rivals, Todd Wilcox, said the impact of Fabrizio shouldn\u2019t be underestimated by Democrats. ", "\u201cThe addition of Tony Fabrizio demonstrates a level of gravitas and political sophistication that should make Democrats lose sleep,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cTony\u2019s strategic expertise will yield a state-by-state plan that wins the White House and defends the down-ballot races.

", " To view foreign political schisms less in terms of ideology than pure power politics would be characteristic, Manafort\u2019s colleagues say, of such an experienced political mercenary \u2014 a deliberately secretive man who was advising Ferdinand Marcos a decade before Yanukovych even entered politics in the mid-1990s.

In 1989, Manafort was hauled in front of a congressional panel for allegedly working to steer funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development into a slum-like New Jersey real estate development. Manafort, caused a stir then on the Hill with a tart defense of his profession. \u201cYou might call it influence-peddling,\u201d he said, according to reports. \u201cI call it lobbying.\u201d ", " Stone, another named partner of the long since disbanded firm, described his former collaborator as \u201ccharming, entertaining, well-tailored and he certainly understands power and how it works.\u201d And Stone would know: Manafort, helped run Stone\u2019s campaign to lead the Young Republicans.

By contrast, the amount the PACs spent on donations and ads was about $955,000 \u2014 or less than 12 percent of their total fundraising haul.

I wanted to buy a lot,\u201d said McCutcheon, who was among the top donors to Backer-linked PACs during the midterms, giving at least $34,000. \u201cIf anybody was getting scammed, it would be me.

Singling out Erickson in particular, Backer pointed out that the pundit\u2019s own email list is routinely rented for fundraising by PACs, including some represented by Backer.

He started DB Capitol Strategies in 2010, not long after graduating from George Mason University School of Law, after a three-month stint working for a firm defending people against mortgage foreclosure, some of whom he said \u201cprobably knew exactly what they were doing and really deserved to be foreclosed upon.\u201d By contrast, he considers tea party PACs both a viable business proposition and a cause he can get behind. ", " \u201cThese guys need legal help, and they need to be able to afford that legal help \u2014 they don\u2019t have big money \u2014 and so there\u2019s not a market big enough there to justify a lot of lawyers practicing in that space,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I kind of found a niche that I work to, but also very much is my philosophy.\u201d ", " When POLITICO presented Backer with a printout listing all 40 committees he\u2019d registered in the past five years, he said \u201cMan, there\u2019s a lot of dead PACs on here,\u201d and began crossing off terminated entities, including a super PAC created to draft Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano for president.

But, as Fred Kaplan ", " in the March/April issue of Politico Magazine, lately the president has proved himself more of a realist, willing to negotiate with the likes of Iran and refusing to get sucked into a raging civil war in Syria, despite a death toll topping 100,000. So what really drives Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy\u2014the belief that he can and should make the world a better place or that America should intervene abroad only when the benefits to the United States are worth the costs?

But how far will Obama be willing to go to protect Ukrainian sovereignty? Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s national security adviser and an arch-realist, said in an interview with ", " that Obama\u2019s \u201ceminently sensible\u201d approach so far in dealing with Russia is yet more evidence that the 44th president is also a realist. \u201cRealism doesn\u2019t mean you immediately start an atomic war,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cYou first, discourage, deter, punish and isolate through other means \u2026 enough to make the Ukrainian adventure very costly to the Russians.\u201d We asked seven other foreign policy thinkers to weigh in on how Obama sees the world\u2014and what it means for the days ahead in Ukraine. ", " *** ", " ", " ", " By Dennis Ross ", " Vladimir Putin defines power in the old-fashioned way: If former Soviet republics with ethnic Russian minorities don\u2019t toe his line, he will either exploit separatist movements or simply move militarily to reincorporate these areas into Russia. Transnistria, Abkhazia and now Crimea are testimony to the Putin doctrine\u2014and he does not let international norms or even international agreements Russia has signed get in the way. ", " In responding to such an undisguised military aggression, both \u201cidealists\u201d and \u201crealists\u201d would feel compelled to impose a cost for such behavior. Idealists because an international norm is being violated, and collective security requires that such norms must not be violated with impunity. Realists because if we fail to impose a cost, Putin may not stop only in Crimea, and deterrence requires that Russia\u2019s leader must understand he will pay a price. ", " President Obama is now acting to mobilize a set of diplomatic and economic consequences. Is he doing so out of idealist or realist impulses? I, for one, don\u2019t know that any American president can ever be neatly characterized as a realist or idealist in foreign policy. George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cFreedom Agenda\u201d would certainly put him in the idealist category, yet he recognized limits and did not apply it to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, given U.S. interests in stability in the oil-rich kingdom and our need for Pakistani cooperation on Afghanistan and fighting terror more generally. Obama\u2019s hesitancy to intervene in Syria leads many, including ", ", to conclude that he is a traditional realist. And, there is much in Kaplan\u2019s article that supports his conclusion; I am sure if he were writing it now, he would seek to explain the president\u2019s response to Putin\u2019s move in Ukraine as one guided by realism. ", "By BEN JUDAH", "By PEMA LEVY", "By \n         ", " BARACK OBAMA", " But Obama, like his predecessors, cannot be characterized in such exclusive terms. When the president called for Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak to leave office, seeing him on the wrong side of the forces of history represented in Tahrir Square, that was not the position of a realist. Similarly, President Obama\u2019s intervention in Libya was driven very heavily by humanitarian instincts. It is true, as Kaplan says, that there was a division on whether we should intervene, but it was not between those who said go in heavy or not at all. I was a participant in those debates, and there were those who argued that we had no vital interests and should not intervene; those who argued that we could not allow a massacre to take place in Benghazi when we had the means to prevent it; and those who argued that we had moral and practical reasons to intervene\u2014particularly given the consequences of mass killings that would trigger a flood of Libyan refugees into Egypt and Tunisia at a time when both were in the early stages of their transitions. ", " The president opted to intervene while also deciding to manage our intervention in a way designed to keep it limited in kind, scope and responsibility. In explaining his decision, he spoke of Muammar al-Qaddafi\u2019s brutality and \u201ca looming humanitarian crisis.\u201d \u201cTo brush aside America\u2019s responsibility as a leader and\u2014more profoundly\u2014our responsibilities to our fellow human beings under such circumstances would have been a betrayal of who we are,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSome nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States of America is different.\u201d Those are not the words of a realist\u2014who see humanitarian interventions as moral crusades that drain American blood and treasure and make us less capable of intervening where our interests demand it. ", " So how does one square these words with the president\u2019s reluctance to intervene in Syria where there is not a looming humanitarian crisis but an existing humanitarian catastrophe that shows no sign of ending? Here Kaplan is closer to the truth. I would say that what guides Obama in his decision-making on interventions as much as anything is feasibility. Can we succeed at an acceptable cost? Can we limit our involvement? Do we have an exit strategy? Clearly, like any president, he has to evaluate those costs against what we have at stake. Those who tend toward realism evaluate stakes one way, and those who tend toward idealism evaluate them differently. ", " But decision-making does not take place in a vacuum. Context and legacy matter. Two wars, trillions of dollars spent and thousands of casualties for outcomes that the American public now question undoubtedly affect Obama\u2019s calculus. No wonder that feasibility and the nature of the threat to us weighs heavily on him. ", " The problem, of course, is that it is always easier to measure the costs of action\u2014they seem concrete and immediate. The costs of inaction are almost always more theoretical and abstract. Having stated that there will be consequences for Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine, the president understands that the costs of doing nothing would be high, and we must now demonstrate the meaning of those words\u2014even if that does not translate into military action. ", " In Syria, the costs of inaction always inclined me to favor a more activist approach for both moral and strategic reasons. When 40 percent of the Syrian population can be displaced and Bashar al-Assad can target and starve non-combatants as a deliberate policy with essentially no consequence, \u201cnever again\u201d and \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d look to be little more than slogans. Strategically, as long as Assad remains in Syria, he will be a magnet for every jihadi worldwide. It is only a matter of time before jihadi bases in a fragmented Syria will use their presence to attack not just Assad but U.S. interests, friends and even our homeland. While our options may not be good today, the landscape and our choices have consistently become worse over time\u2014and Obama, who takes the responsibility to protect the United States very seriously, will, I suspect, at some point evaluate feasibility and stakes differently over the coming months. Will our actions then be driven by idealism or realism\u2014or both?
