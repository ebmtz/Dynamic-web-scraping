She visited that office before going to her superiors but found it unhelpful, saying a staffer merely recited language from its website. She also knew that in order to file a complaint she would first have to go through at least 30 days of mediation and likely more. Last year, Gillibrand called that a \u201cdaunting requirement,\u201d while pushing to reform the compliance office.", "So the woman turned to Gillibrand\u2019s aides.

", "She recalled that Fassler reacted defensively about the office\u2019s handling of the allegations and told her that she had also committed fireable offenses during her time in the office. One comment by Fassler that particularly galled her, she said, was that investigation found that she had \u201cfed\u201d Malik alcohol while he was on duty as a driver. In her claim, she wrote that she and Malik had grabbed a quick drink in the courtyard of the Capitol late one afternoon to talk about the office. She was frustrated that Fassler was blaming her given that Malik is an adult capable of deciding what to consume.", "\u201cI felt as though I was being belittled, insulted and intimidated even when I was trying to quit,\u201d she wrote in her resignation letter.", "Gillibrand\u2019s office acknowledged the exchange but said Fassler was obligated to raise what it called \u201can unrelated office policy violation\u201d with the woman, referring to the alcohol incident.

In her final days at the office, the woman agonized over whether to send the letter to Gillibrand. Doing so would almost certainly burn bridges and likely hurt her professional prospects in the clubby world of national politics.

For years, the senator has positioned herself at the forefront of fighting sexual misconduct in the military and in Congress. She wrote in Fortune last April that \u201cCongress has a sexual harassment problem\u2014and isn\u2019t taking it seriously,\u201d and helped push through legislation to overhaul the institution\u2019s practices.

The first time a secret ballot was widely deployed was the presidential election of 1896\u2014also the first election in which someone was not murdered on Election Day, according to Harvard professor Jill Lepore. The two are not a coincidence: Since the earliest days of the republic, voting was almost entirely a collectivist act.

But Wallach\u2019s focus has shifted from diagnosis to cure, and he\u2019s now working with Travis County, where Austin is located, as a leading researcher on the newest innovation in voting technology: Cryptographic voting. ", "Wallach walks backward through the concept by offering a thought experiment. The most unimpeachable election technique would be to count the votes on an enormous corkboard; every voter would pin his or her vote, and the public would count the results together. Everyone would see the votes, and everyone would agree on the result. Besides the problem of privacy and intimidation (and, ostensibly, killings on Election Day), such a system is ungainly\u2014it\u2019s a lot of corkboard. But encrypting the vote would allow a public accounting while keeping the actual votes private: voters would make their selection on a digital processing machine; they\u2019d then receive an encrypted receipt, a random assortment of numbers and letters. Their vote would then be uploaded to a public bulletin board online; any voter could compare their encrypted vote to see if it matched the numbers and letters online. The vote itself would be scrambled and completely secret; a complex function, known as homomorphic cryptography, would count the votes without unencrypting the source. ", "\u201cCrypto,\u201d as it\u2019s known in the field, would secure our elections something close to permanently. But it would change fundamentally the way we vote. It would make the act of gawking at random source code a civic requirement. And it would abolish the concept of a countable \u201cballot,\u201d forcing us to trust that incomprehensible code is the equivalent of a ballot. Cryptographic voting is still years away from ready. But it also begs the question of whether the concept has simply transferred a technocratic leap of faith from one part of the electronic system to another one. It seemed difficult to believe, after a bruising decade of invisible votes and disappearing ballots, that voters would put their faith in something so abstract. After four explanations from Wallach, I was still dumbfounded. ", "Wallach and other researchers point to another safeguard that is closer to application-ready, a new method of auditing. The technique is called Risk Limited Auditing, statistical innovation worked out by Philip Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The auditing techniques of most states aren\u2019t sophisticated enough to detect a subtle attack\u2014every 100 th vote switched from Trump to Hillary Clinton, for instance. \u201cThe whole point of a Risk Limiting Audit is not to find the tally down to the last digit,\u201d explains Wallach. \u201cThe problem you\u2019re trying to figure out is if the error rate is big enough that I could change who won.\u201d RLA would enhance the auditing prospects of most states, 25 of which have inadequate auditing procedures, according to Verified Voting. Colorado is expected to implement RLA next year. ", "But there may be a simpler hack at hand. Appel, the Princeton cybersecurity expert\u2014master of numbers, merry prankster of machines\u2014proposes a radical idea to this 15-year nightmare: What if we took a page from the town criers of two centuries ago, and simply read the precinct results out loud? ", "\u201cThere\u2019s a very simple and old-fashioned recipe that we use in our American democracy,\u201d Appel says. \u201cThe vote totals in each polling place are announced at the time the polls closed, in the polling place, to all observers\u2014the poll workers, the party challengers, any citizen that\u2019s observing the closing of the polls.\u201d He goes on to describe how the totals in that precinct would be written on a piece of paper\u2014pencils do just fine\u2014then signed by the poll workers who have been operating that polling site. ", "\u201cAny citizen can independently add up the precinct -by - precinct totals,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a very important check. It\u2019s a way that with our precinct-based polling systems, we can have some assurance that hacked computers could not undetectably change the results of our election.\u201d ", "There could be a greater lesson in Appel\u2019s point. Technology didn\u2019t create the problem. Perhaps technology is intrinsic to the problem\u2014our lack of trust that has metastasized in a surveillance culture was bound to aggrandize the problems of voting, the most trusting civic act we know. It seems unlikely to expect a singular cure to the American presidential election, not because of the incomprehensibility of cryptography or the untrustworthiness of tech companies, but because there is no such thing as the singular election: 8,000 jurisdictions in a leaky mess of federalism and poorly spent dollars. The neat results and cable announcements on election night represent an optical illusion, like a series of ones and zeroes, whizzing beyond our apprehension. ", "Wallach\u2019s encomium on cryptography reminded me of another tech item: The concept of shared fate, sometimes referenced in drone research. Researchers have long suggested our planes and trains could be made safer were they run by highly precise robots, or drone pilots\u2014cool customers who don\u2019t have to save a burning plane while worrying about turbulence and screaming passengers. It may be one of the most enduring examples of psychology trumping technocracy: Even though systems would run better\u2014even save lives\u2014everyone knows this arrangement is unworkable. Humans require knowing that there\u2019s someone, like us, in the cockpit. We need to know we\u2019ll endure a shared fate. ", "If this century has shifted our trust from away from our neighbors toward machines, it might be time to switch back again. Eight countries in Europe that once flirted with digital voting have seen six go back to paper; Britain counted its Brexit votes by hand. Even if the vote were never hacked\u2014and it is an exceedingly implausible event\u2014the remotest possibility is an albatross on democracy and a boon for mischief-makers, and not just the cyber attackers. Trump\u2019s most recent jujitsu\u2014pointing out that by virtue of the fact that the election is hackable, it could be rigged against him\u2014illustrates this risk. Technology has amplified not only the threat of hacking, but the threat of a hack.

", " All three of the organizations sanctioned Friday have been previously sanctioned by the U.S. and in some cases by the United Nations. None of the 10 individuals have been previously sanctioned. ", " Administration officials could not say if any of them currently have any assets with U.S. financial institutions or would be immediately impacted by Friday\u2019s announcement, but said the goal was to send a signal to the international community. ", " The administration is confident that regardless of connections to the U.S., Friday\u2019s actions will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on their ability to operate. ", " \u2018\u201dI think more importantly, perhaps, than whether they have any assets in the U.S., these individuals are now known to the world to be representatives of KOMID, North Korea\u2019s primary arms dealer around the world. Their ability to access the financial system anywhere is going to be impaired by today\u2019s actions because banks everywhere will take note \u2026 and will make life quite difficult for any of these individuals to continue to work on behalf of KOMID or for that matter to have any sort of financial activity altogether,\u201d the official said.

We didn\u2019t have a lot of good cards to play, and they\u2019re playing their hand relatively well.\u201d ", " Healey said the administration is smart to make the issue less about the cyberattack itself, and more about the problem of North Korea generally by sanctioning individuals tied to the government as opposed to the attack. ", " That idea was echoed by New America Foundation strategist and senior fellow Peter Singer, who said even if the sanctions won\u2019t necessarily be felt in North Korea or won\u2019t bring about regime change, they do send an important message in terms of precedent. ", " \u201cThis is not solely about North Korea, it\u2019s about sending a signal to the rest of the world and rolling back the unfortunate precedent that Sony and the movie theaters [not initially releasing the film] set for us, which is there\u2019s no cost to a cyberattack,\u201d Singer said. \u201cSo even if this is not as effective against an economy that\u2019s already heavily sanctioned and is incredibly weak and individuals who don\u2019t travel around the world, if you\u2019re someone who \u2026 has broader interests or you\u2019re an individual who likes to go to the South of France or Maldives, these are the kind of consequences that might happen to you.\u201d ", " \u201cIt\u2019s precedent-setting in terms of both that we would react to a cyberattack on a private company and how we are reacting,\u201d Singer added. ", " The president is currently on a family vacation in Hawaii, but said in ", " to House Speaker John Boehner announcing the sanctions that they reflect a determination that the cyberattack was a threat to U.S. national security. ", " \u201cI have now determined that that the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087 and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d Obama wrote. ", " The FBI announced it had concluded North Korea was behind the attack, which wiped out Sony\u2019s servers and computer network for a week and dumped massive amounts of sensitive company data, emails and other intellectual property on the Internet, on Dec. 19. ", " Obama reiterated the government\u2019s determination of North Korea\u2019s responsibility at a press conference that day before leaving for his Hawaiian trip, and pledged a \u201cproportionate response.\u201d Friday\u2019s sanctions are the U.S. government\u2019s first declared response since that day. ", " In the interim, the cybersecurity community has expressed skepticism of North Korea\u2019s culpability based on the indicators the FBI cited as evidence for its conclusion, but officials and the FBI have remained firm that there is no evidence suggesting any other entity is behind the attack. ", " In Friday\u2019s call an official said the FBI is \u201cstanding by our assessment\u201d and has access to channels for intelligence that private security firms do not.

", " The plan says the 2025 target also puts the United States on a path toward deeper emissions reductions in the coming decades.

While that approach makes the talks more likely to succeed, it also means the end result will be less ambitious. Indeed, analysts agree that the final international pact almost certainly won\u2019t do enough on its own to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change.

At interim climate talks ", " ", " in Lima, Peru, negotiators set a goal of countries issuing the plans by the end of March if they can.

GLASSER", "POLITICO", "Whatever you think about President Donald Trump, his speech Friday announcing the rollback of President Barack Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba and castigating the Castro government for its human rights abuses, must surely rate as one of the most head-snapping of his young presidency. ", "Story Continued Below", "There he was lecturing the Cubans on \u201cimprisoning innocents,\u201d on harboring bad guys, supporting \u201cforced labor\u201d and general \u201cexploitation all around the globe.\u201d For any of America\u2019s past few decades, this might have passed for standard-issue rhetoric.", "But this is Trump, the same guy who has spent the first few months of his presidency praising dictators from China\u2019s Xi Jinping (\u201ca good man, a very good man\u201d) and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un (\u201ca very smart cookie\u201d) to Egypt\u2019s Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi (\u201che\u2019s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation\u201d) and Turkey\u2019s Recip Tayyip Erdogan, who received a fanfare-laden White House reception. And then, of course, there\u2019s his famous affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose \u201cstrength,\u201d toughness, leadership \u2014 and praise for Trump \u2014 have all come in for favorable notice.", "The message to the world\u2019s autocrats and dictators, strongmen and would-be tough guys couldn\u2019t have been more clear.", "So what to make of the Cuba speech, coming after all that? ", "\u201cIt just confirms one of the favorite arguments of America\u2019s critics: that our advocacy for freedom and democracy is just a weapon we use to beat up our enemies, not a principled policy we apply to everyone,\u201d says Tom Malinowski, this week\u2019s guest on The Global Politico. Malinowski spent the past few years pushing Obama from the inside on human rights as his assistant secretary of state; a former Washington director of Human Rights Watch, he is now leading the resistance from the outside to Trump and what he calls his \u201cobscene\u201d fondness for the world\u2019s tyrants.", "Not so long ago, Malinowski was caught up in the Obama administration\u2019s agonized internal debates. What to do about Syria and a civil war threatening millions of innocent civilians? How much do press allies like Turkey and Egypt amid internal crackdowns arresting thousands? What about Russia, and the ritualistic American complaints about the rollback of democratic freedoms that infuriated an increasingly aggressive Putin?", "As the top-ranking U.S. government official with human rights in his job title, he was often on the losing side, nudging a Democratic president who talked in sweeping terms of global freedoms but, in practice, became progressively more reluctant to act as their guarantor. \u201cEverybody was frustrated with where we were on Syria at the end of eight years of the Obama administration,\u201d Malinowski acknowledges. ", "But that was then. ", "Now, in the Trump presidency, it all seems rather beside the point, Malinowski argues in our extensive interview, which covered everything from those internal Obama battles and the nitty-gritty of what it\u2019s like to spend a career \u201carguing with dictators\u201d to his last-ditch effort to stop Trump from overturning sanctions on Russia in the days immediately after his inauguration. Trump, he says, isn\u2019t just making the sort of normal course correction that occurs when the White House changes hands. He\u2019s making \u201ca complete departure from decades of American tradition.\u201d ", "***", "Welcome back. I\u2019m Susan Glasser and this is the ", " and this is going to be a great episode, I think, of the ", " because my guest this week is Tom Malinowski, who is already making me laugh \u2014 and we haven\u2019t even started talking. So that bodes well. Tom most recently was the assistant secretary of state for Human Rights and that gives him a pretty unique perspective on the abrupt and even rapid switch in foreign policy that we\u2019re seeing between the Obama administration, in which Tom serviced since 2014, and the Trump administration.", "So I\u2019m just going to jump right in. You wrote a piece recently in ", ", which was really powerful explaining a little bit about the work that you do, and you talked about how presidents \u2014 when they leave in their farewell addresses \u2014 tend to sum up, and really to summon the values that are at the heart of American foreign policy. President Obama, in fact, said in his goodbye address that \u201cAmerica\u2019s rivals will never match our influence unless we give up what we stand for.\u201d And that seemed to me like already President Obama was anticipating this switch in foreign policy, anticipating a world in which Donald Trump would make his very first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, to a country that doesn\u2019t even allow women to drive.", "That it\u2019s not that you and others in the Obama administration didn\u2019t see pretty clearly what was going to happen, but trying to understand now what are the consequences of that? Has America gotten out of the human rights and values business? ", "Our president has, unfortunately. I don\u2019t think America has. I think that the United States of America has for a very long time had an idea of itself as a country that stands for something larger in the world than just our immediate self-enrichment or self-protection. That idea has inspired us in our moments of crisis from World War II to the Cold War. I think it has inspired people all over the world and sometimes, persuaded them to tolerate a bit more power from the United States than they might tolerate from other great powers [laughs] because we\u2019ve managed to convince them more often than not that America uses that power for the common good, for the betterment of the world.", "When we have not lived up to that ideal; when we have screwed up, as we have many, many times, the one thing that brings us back is the sense that we are supposed to do better. So, we judge ourselves in accordance with this very high standard. And all of our presidents really since Jimmy Carter at least have explicitly made the promotion of human rights and freedoms and democracy part of our foreign policy. We\u2019ve always debated how to do it, and I\u2019ve served under two presidents: President Clinton and President Obama, and we had all kinds of arguments. How do we do it in Saudi Arabia? Should we intervene in countries like Syria or Bosnia or Libya when people are in trouble? How do we deal with countries that are partners on terrorism or security but also abuse their people?", "And we have these arguments about the means, but we\u2019ve always agreed on the ends. Every president has believed that America is better off if people around the world have greater freedoms, and that is the radical shift that we\u2019re experiencing now. ", "Well, it\u2019s interpreting that you make this point; that we\u2019re now at a point where arguably the Trump administration or at least the president himself. Maybe not everybody in it. Obviously, there are some people, like U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who are pursuing their own more traditional version of American foreign policy at the moment, and we can talk about that. So you\u2019re making this argument basically that that\u2019s the disjuncture of President Trump?", "I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people, as I\u2019m sure you have around Washington, though, who think there is more continuity than people would like to acknowledge between President Obama and President Trump when it comes to this issue of imposing sort of an American vision of the world onto other countries. President Obama obviously had a different demeanor, but he, too, shared some attributes with President Trump [such as his] weariness about projecting values at the heart of our foreign policy. He was kind of a Democratic version of a realist. ", " I don\u2019t agree with that. I think there has always been a wariness in American foreign policy to varying degrees of imposing, interfering, getting ourselves embroiled in complicated foreign situations. Sometimes we do it. Sometimes we hold back. But it\u2019s all a debate about the means. President Obama embraced the Arab Spring. He spoke out in favor of dissidents in Egypt and Bahrain and Libya. He intervened militarily in Libya to support the revolution there. His initial speech in the region\u2014at the famous speech in Cairo ...", " The Cairo speech.", "was all about the potential for political transformation and how that\u2019s the key to fighting terrorism and extremism. And then in his farewell address, like that of every president since forever was, as you mentioned, a tribute to this quality of American leadership around the world. Now, some people criticized us in the Obama administration for not doing more in some places. Some people felt we did too much. But President Obama, like President Bush, like President Reagan, like President Clinton, believed that we would be better off if people in Saudi Arabia had the right to choose their leaders, if women had the right to drive. If folks in countries that are beset by extremism had peaceful ways of expressing their grievances. And what\u2019s very, very different\u2014it\u2019s not there\u2019s a different tone or a different way of doing things in this administration; it\u2019s that President Trump has explicitly said that he is just not interested in advancing this aim and by his words and actions.", "And almost more important, his body language: You can just tell that he has a clear preference for, admiration for strong men and dictators. My goodness, he even has explicitly praised the president of the Philippines campaign of murdering drug users and drug dealers in the thousands. This is, I have to say, just obscene and a complete departure from decades of American tradition. ", " It\u2019s hard to imagine who would be a successor to you as an assistant secretary in charge of Human Rights in the Trump administration. We can talk a little bit more later on what\u2019s going on inside the State Department since you\u2019ve left. But I want to keep on this Obama thing. Take us behind the curtain a little bit. You pointed out, obviously, there were many debates. One of the things that was striking was President Obama\u2019s own evolution. He is famous for this stirring rhetoric. He gives this Cairo speech. He\u2019s given many speeches that invoked the grandiose nature of American commitment to the world and its transformational view really of why what happens inside other countries matters to them and to the rest of us. And yet, dot, dot, dot.", "And yet, the Syria Civil War unfolded on his watch. Six years, hundreds of thousands dead. Millions of refugees. This is surely going to be a blot on President Obama\u2019s record. He had the ability to do many things he chose in the end not to do. It was a series of circular and for you, I\u2019m sure, very painful debates. You were supportive at various points in time of doing more. Give us a little bit of a window into what this abstract human rights debate looks like in practice. I mean, your job was to be the guy at the table standing up for those principles and yet, again and again, that collides with a lot of other competing realities for a president forced to make those decisions.", "It\u2019s complicated, in one word, our experience in Syria \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of having worked for President Obama. I think he championed freedom around the world. He championed our interests around the world. He demonstrated extraordinary integrity in doing so. In seriousness, obviously, two smart people agree on everything, one of them isn\u2019t thinking\u2014 that\u2019s the old clich\u00e9. And Syria is a place where I wish we had done more. And I think our experience in Syria is probably the most powerful recent argument for America caring about human rights in other countries. Because this was a small, a relatively unimportant country thousands and thousands of miles away. And one day, a bunch of teenagers; 14-, 15-year-old boys, spray some graffiti on a wall and they get picked up by the police and they get tortured and then the people of their town get pissed off and start demonstrating and then more people get arrested and then more people get angry.", "And before we know it, we have a revolution against a brutal dictator that ultimately results in millions of refugees walking to Europe, upending the politics of our closest allies, sparking in part this wave of right-wing populism that we\u2019re all struggling with right now. And, on top of that, the formation of ISIS, a terrorist movement that is worse than Al Qaeda. And all because of a dysfunctional relationship between a dictator and his people in a small country thousands of miles away. ", "So, however, folks think we should have dealt with that, and that\u2019s a really, really tough question \u2014 I think it is probably the most powerful proof that I can present that these issues should matter to the United States. ", "But you\u2019re in this job now. You were not in this position at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, but obviously, you came into the role much earlier in the game when there were more options available to the president and you and I talked throughout this period of time, including before you got the job. And you were very engaged with what are options that are real, that are concrete. How do I get support on Capitol Hill for taking various actions that might influence President Obama from your previous life as the Washington director of the Human Rights Watch, here. ", "You understood the different tools and levers available to lobby the president. You worked those. Your colleague, Samantha Power, obviously, pressed and pressed such that President Obama was reported to have essentially given up and rolled his eyes at her. What was it like? Why did President Obama, a man who, as you said, shares these values that you have? Why didn\u2019t he do more when we could have? Tell us what it was like when you were sitting at the table? ", " First of all, the debate about Syria was ultimately a debate about the hardest thing that a president has to do, and that is to make decisions about war and peace. Most of our \u2014 99 percent of our debates about human rights policy and foreign policy don\u2019t involve that kind of choice, and I think anybody who has not been the president needs to give some deference to the extraordinary burden that a preident who is command-in-chief and can send our men and women into battle has to bear. I can\u2019t speak for President Obama. I have, of course, listened to him many, many times, and I think his primary concern was rooted in our experience in Iraq. Rooted in a sense that we Americans sometimes have too much confidence in our ability to solve complicated problems in that part of the world, and sometimes we go in for the right reasons and we find ourselves stuck.", "And we find ourselves \u2014 I think he would argue, creating more problems than solving. And so, he asked a lot of, I think, legitimate questions. If we impose a no-fly zone. If we take the steps that some of us were recommending. What is the likely first, second, and third order effects?", " Was there a moment in time that you can look back on now and say, 'Wow, if only that particular meeting had gone differently?'", " I don\u2019t think there was, and I wasn\u2019t in meetings in the Oval Office at which ultimately these decisions were made. I think President Obama was simply never convinced that we could intervene against the Assad regime in a way that would resolve this situation without getting the United States of America stuck in another Middle Eastern conflict. Now, the irony is that we are now stuck in a difficult Middle Eastern conflict in Syria with not only daily airstrikes, but troops on the ground engaged in combat, which is far, far more than any proponent of humanitarian intervention Syria was proposing early on, and in my personal view, could have been avoided had we done a little bit more at an early point to stop that carnage. I cannot prove that I\u2019m right. ", "And the problem we are facing is the one that we must face today.", " I\u2019ve been particularly amazed at just how viscerally people in the region seem to take President Obama\u2019s views. There\u2019s nowhere in the world where the leaders have been so pro-Trump as in the Middle East and you go around \u2014you and I have both had this experience of talking with people in the region and there was just an absolute disregard for President Obama after eight years of this sort of grueling, trying to nudge things in a better direction at a time of arguably real unraveling in the Middle East. What do you attribute that to? Obviously, Europe has a very different point of view about Donald Trump but across the region \u2014 and this includes Israel as well as many of the Gulf States. There was a real disappointment in President Obama that was pretty palpable. Why do you think that is? Is it because he had pesky folks like you lecturing them about human rights?", " Well, it depends a lot on who you talk to. Eight years is a long time and the conflict in Syria, I think, took its toll on everybody. And it should have because it created so much harm, not just to the region but to the whole world, and everybody was frustrated with where we were on Syria at the end of the eight years of the Obama administration. But let\u2019s also be a little bit honest. The fundamental dispute that, for example, Saudi Arabia had with the Obama administration is that President Obama embraced the Arab Spring.", "And Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important priority in the last several years has not been to fight terrorism. It has not been to help the people of Syria. It has not even been to counter Iran. ", "It has been to push back these forces of rapid liberalization that the Arab Spring represented. And they never forgave us for the very simple statements that President Obama made in support of the Tahrir Square Revolution in Egypt. And by the same token, I think there are autocrats in the Middle East who see in the Trump administration a reflection of themselves. They see a president who mixes business and politics. A president who employs his family. A president who does not concern himself with values of democracy and freedom and rule of law. ", "A president whose former national security adviser could be put on one\u2019s payroll and I think there was a temporary moment in which a lot of autocratic leaders around the world breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of such an American administration. I also think that, as time goes by, they may get a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse. ", "Yeah, so tell us a little bit about that transition after this shocking election upset and it became clear to all of the tough customers in your human rights portfolio at the State Department that there was not going to be the Hillary Clinton administration that they had expected, but there was going to be a Donald Trump administration. You\u2019ve recounted one incident with a Central Asian diplomat basically chortling at this. You and your staff must have actually gotten a lot of pushback from people saying, 'Hey, there\u2019s going to be a new sheriff in town. Your finger wagging days are over.'", "Yeah, we knew the day after election day that there was really not much more that we could do and that was very, very sad and we heard about it from some of our interlocutors around the world. So you mentioned an ambassador from Central Asia who came by and saw one of my deputies and said, \u201cGosh, you guys must feel so stupid. All you\u2019ve been doing is talking democracy this and democracy that and free elections here and there, and now your own president-elect says that America\u2019s election was rigged and that 3 million people voted illegally. Gosh, you must feel so stupid.' ", "And so, I heard about this and I was a little bit pissed off. So I asked the guy to come and see me. And I said, 'I heard about what you said to my deputy. And I get where you\u2019re coming from. I know, given what Trump is saying, we\u2019re probably not going to be able to have some of the conversations with you guys that we had before about democracy. But I also want to ask you: How are you feeling?' Because again, this is a Central Asian country, and I said, 'You do realize that your country is not very important and that there\u2019s a lot of things that you like about' ...", "[Laughs] What talking from a diplomat. ", "Well, at this point, who cares? ", "Game over, yeah.", " 'You come from a small, relatively unimportant country, and you rely on the United States to back you up against your big neighbors, Russia and China. You do realize that the only reason we do that is because we have these principles. It\u2019s not because you really matter. And so, if America is going to have a transactional foreign policy where we align ourselves with big countries that can do stuff for us, you\u2019re probably going to be out of luck. How does that make you feel?'", "And he admitted that he was very, very nervous and then we had a much more honest conversation about the future. And Israel \u2014 my goodness. President Obama, I think, was pretty darn good to Israel in terms of aid and arms sales and backing them up at the U.N. \u2014 and in all kinds of other ways. But at the end of the day, Israel needs a United States of America that has authority in the world. If our relationship with our core European allies is shredded, that is not good for Israel. We\u2019re not going to be able to defend Israel if we are alone in the world. America First is not a great recipe for an effective partnership with Israel and protecting it against all of the threats that it faces. And virtually every country in the world, including the autocracies needs something from America that we give because we have a good heart, not just because we are self-interested. And I think \u2014 it\u2019s only been a few weeks and already some of the buyer\u2019s remorse may be setting in. ", "Well, what I\u2019m struck by is that, of course, these tensions always existed in American foreign policy and even in a democratic administration like the one you served in, it\u2019s not easy to balance those things. I\u2019m thinking of your own experience in Bahrain. Maybe we should talk about that when you were assistant secretary. Of course, that\u2019s a place that is very important to the Pentagon. It\u2019s very important to our strategic position in the Persian Gulf. The American 5th Fleet is headquartered there and what happened when you came to town and tried to meet with people they didn\u2019t want you to meet with.", "Nothing. What are you talking about? [Laughs] Our relationship with Bahrain is strong and solid and there\u2019s no problem. ", "Tom, you\u2019re not the assistant secretary.", "Oh, sorry. You\u2019re right..", "Put your other hat on, please.", "Well, there was that minor incident in which I was kicked out the country. I do recall now. Thank you for reminding me. So, yeah, Bahrain is an interesting case. It\u2019s important to us because we have a military base there, a very important strategic relationship. But it\u2019s also a country that is roughly evenly divided between Shia and Sunni. Actually, more Shia than Sunni \u2014 but it is ruled by a Sunni monarchy and naturally, the Shia majority would like to have more representation in the government. ", "We felt very, very strongly that it would be good for Bahrain and good for the Middle East as a whole for this country to live up to its stated commitment to political inclusion. To show this divide between Sunni and Shia can be overcome through democracy rather than something that can only be managed by one side dominating the other side. And so, we felt we had both security interests in a partnership with Bahrain but also security interests in nudging them toward greater democracy. ", "I went, interestingly, at their invitation, to go talk to them about this stuff and it was Ramadan and during Ramadan in Bahrain, there\u2019s a tradition of the Majlis where people, families, organizations, have receptions in their homes and you go and you pay your respects in the evening. And I started my trip by going to the Ramadan reception, the Majlis, of the main moderate Shia opposition party, Al-Wefaq, at which I had a conversation with the opposition leader, primarily about soccer and the World Cup, and we were laughing about that and pictures were snapped. ", "It showed up on social media and hard-liners in the Bahraini government flipped out, accusing me of meeting with the opposition before I met with the government, and I was PNGed by Twitter. PNG means \u201cpersona non-grata.\u201d", "When that happens to a diplomat, it\u2019s a big deal.", " It\u2019s a big deal. I think I am the first and probably still the only diplomat in the history of the world to have been PNGed by Twitter. It\u2019s a great honor. I\u2019m very proud. Thank you, Bahrain. ", "But now we live in the Trump era, so more Twitter PNGing is entirely possible. ", "It\u2019s entirely possible my record might be broken. But it was interesting. There was a little diplomatic crisis over this, as you can imagine. Our government didn\u2019t take kindly to that sort of treatment of a senior U.S. diplomat. A few months later, I went back and had a really good and warm conversation with the king of Bahrain and the crown prince and the whole government. I met the opposition again. We tried really, really hard to encourage a deal in which the opposition could run in freer elections in that country. Sadly, it failed.", "And here\u2019s what I think was interesting about this: There were a lot of people who were skeptical about what we were trying to do in Bahrain. Some of them felt that we really didn\u2019t have enough influence to really effectively promote democratic change in a country that was so arguably set in its autocratic ways. Other people argued, 'Well, we had influence but we just weren\u2019t using enough of it. We weren\u2019t trying hard enough.' Because it didn\u2019t seem like we were succeeding. Things remained bad. Now, Trump goes to Saudi Arabia. He meets with the king of Bahrain and instead of gently nudging him to respect human rights, he explicitly tells the king, 'We are not going to have this problem with you anymore. This is no longer an issue between us.'", "And within a few days, the government or Bahrain launches a much more violent and brutal and complete crackdown on dissent, free press, political opposition. And what that shows, to me, is that sometimes the measure of our success, when we promote these values overseas, is not a gloriously free and fair election, a glorious transformation to freedom and democracy, though sometimes that happens. Sometimes all we can do is just maintain a little bit of deterrence to keep the subject of human rights on the minds of the rulers in that country so that they feel like there are still some norms they can\u2019t break. There are still some lines that they can\u2019t cross. ", " So your role in the Obama administration was really \u2014 it was sort of like a journalist. I\u2019m thinking of that scene in ", "where the pesky kid gets beaten up by all of the other kids. That\u2019s usually the role of the journalist. But basically, the human rights guy at the table is kind of like that too. So when you don\u2019t have that guy around ...", "Well, it\u2019s not so much that human rights are cut when this is absent from our foreign policy. Things get a lot worse in the world. I think one of the ...", "Just to push back on that a little bit, when you were in this role did you feel like that they thought, 'Oh, here they go again. This is the price of doing business with the Americans that I have to have these people like Tom come and lecture me about the' ...", "Sometimes, but that\u2019s because I had the backing of the president and the secretary of state and the country and the Congress.", " That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That was the price of doing business with America was to listen to people like you. ", " But they were sensitive to what we had to say in most of these countries. There were a couple of places where I just felt like it\u2019s not worth going because all it would be is meeting with a bored official who just wants to get off ...", " Check a box?", "Check a box. But I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019d go to an autocratic country and have intense conversations, debates with presidents, the head of the secret police, the interior minister; conversations that would go on for hours in which they were striving with all of their might to try to justify themselves or to try to convince me that what they were doing was either different from what I thought or the right thing to do. And what that taught me \u2014 and I think this is a really important insight. Is that dictators are a lot more insecure about their legitimacy than elected leaders. ", "You get elected president of the United States or France, you don\u2019t have to be insecure about your legitimacy because it comes ...", "Well, we have one right now who is insecure, Tom, but ...", " Well, that\u2019s a unique circumstance but if you got elected fair and square, then you have a right to rule for your term. But most dictators know darn well that they\u2019re not legitimate so they desperately want our approval and they desperately want to avoid our disapproval. I was lobbied so many times by governments around the world to not issue public statements about their human rights record.", "They would send diplomats and say, 'Oh, Tom, I know you guys have these concerns but don\u2019t say anything publicly because it would be really counterproductive.' And every time they did that, it convinced me that we probably should issue that public statement because for whatever reason, they are really insecure about being called out. And when that stops \u2014 and this is, I think, maybe the silver lining in the current circumstances: that we are, for the next couple of years, going to be running a controlled experiment in what it means for the United States to be absent as a moral leader around the world. ", "The bad news is a lot of people are going to be harmed because of this. The good news, I hope, at the end of it is that we will see as clearly as we have never seen before the value of America playing that role because we will see the consequences of our absence. And if that\u2019s what we have to go through to understand clearly the value of America playing a principled role on the world stage and working with our allies to advance these values, then perhaps something good can come of this. ", "I always did think you had to be a pretty big optimist to take this kind of role and to take up human rights as your profession. Just quickly, because there\u2019s so much I want to ask you about what\u2019s happening right now. But why did you pick up human rights as your profession? It\u2019s an unusual career to make. There are a lot of people who talk about it but very few who actually spend their lives doing it. How did you come to this?", "Well, I think it\u2019s fun having arguments with dictators [laughs]. Very few get to do it as often as I have. ", " Well, and which dictator were you most interested to meet, by the way? ", " Well, that\u2019s a good question. I never got to spar with Putin. That would have been fun.", "I\u2019ve met Putin.", " ", " Well, you can tell me about that. But it\u2019s not ...", " I asked him about Chechnya, by the way. I was the skunk at the garden party in his first interview with Western reporters. And I was one of the most junior ones. This was in the spring of 2001. So they had gotten almost two-thirds of the way around the table before the question got to me, and no one had asked him about Chechnya and human rights, so I felt that I had to.", "Yeah, well, often, it\u2019s not the leader of the country that\u2019s most interesting. It could be the head of the police or even the head of the secret police and as you know from your Russian experience, often the smartest people in these countries are given the domestic internal security function. And it\u2019s interesting to me how folks like that often want to talk about what they do. I had a fascinating three-hour meeting with the head of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s secret police once before I was at the State Department. And we went at it on imprisoning dissidents, on torture and whether it was effective or not and he was as fascinated to meet me as I was fascinated to meet him.", "And do you ever convince somebody in a meeting like that? Of course not.", "But I always wanted to use those meetings to get it into the heads of these people that they are being watched, that somebody in the world who has power knows what they are doing, and that there may be at some point, as a consequence of those facts, consequences for that person if they cross a certain line. And again, taking that away, it\u2019s a radical change. ", "So I look back on being a diplomat and I think about all of the amazing, interesting conversations with leaders around the world and officials and how fascinating the issues were. Sometimes, I have to remind myself of the silly moments and how sometimes the dominant feeling you have is just being exhausted and you\u2019re going from meeting to meeting to meeting in a foreign country or perhaps doing what we used to call \u201cdiplomatic speed dating\u201d at the U.N., where you have 10 meetings a day with different countries for seven or eight days straight.", " This is every September when the U.N. General Assembly meets.", "That\u2019s right, and I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I probably had a lot of meetings with government ministers from other countries where I just didn\u2019t even know the name of the person I was meeting with \u2014 and it was on my briefing paper, but you forget. And a funny version of this happened at the U.N. when I was scheduled to meet \u2014 it was on my schedule \u2014 with the president of Burkina Faso, President Compaor\u00e9, the now former leader of that country, and he\u2019d been in power for decades and was trying to extend his stay by another term, contrary to his constitution. And back in that time, we had a policy of encouraging leaders all over the world to respect their constitutions; to leave when their term limits were up.", "And so I show up at his suite outside his door, and I see this gentleman walking down the hall toward us, and he sees me and he greets me, and says, 'Oh, are you here to see me?' And I said, 'Yes.' And I looked at him and I had once briefly met President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso and this did not look like President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, but I wasn\u2019t sure. So he led me into the suite and we sat down and we started this bilateral meeting. And I\u2019m still not sure who this man is and it is important to know because usually, you\u2019re talking about policy. 'Your government should pull its troops out of here or your government should release that political prisoner.'", "But here, I\u2019m talking about you, Mr. President, should leave office and so the personal pronoun becomes very important! And I\u2019m struggling for about five minutes, and then I notice to my relief, that he\u2019s wearing a small U.N. nametag, and I strained my eyes to look at it without appearing to strain my eyes to look at it and I noticed that it\u2019s the foreign minister of Burkina Faso and not the president. And I managed to adjust quickly enough to say that \"he\" should leave office rather than \"you, Sir.\" ", " Did the president even show up? ", "No, he never did.", "And did he leave office?", "He was made to leave office by his people. Had he listened to us, he would be in a much better shape right now. ", " Right, he was in a spate of coups, as I remember what happened a few years ago.", "And I thought to myself, You know, we are sometimes arrogant as Americans. I wonder if any visiting diplomat ever comes to Washington and sits down with our secretary of state and he\u2019s wondering to himself, 'Is this Kerry? Or is this Obama? Is this Obama? Who is this?'", "Is this Biden [laughter]?", "But you started this because you had a fascination with dictators and with autocratic societies.", "No, no, no. I skipped to something that was fun about it. I am interested in political change in autocratic societies. I was born in Poland when it was a Communist country. I was very inspired watching it as a kid in the Solidarity Revolution move toward democracy. I\u2019ve seen in my own experience the role that America plays in people\u2019s imaginations around the world, and so it gives me a lot of pride now. Especially as an immigrant to America to now ...", "And you came here when?", " I was 6 years old, and I do have that kind of immigrants' \u2014 the simple love of this country. And the idea that I could get on a plane and speak to a foreign leader with all of the might and majesty of the United States of America behind me, as a representative of our president, on behalf of our values. That makes me feel \u2014it was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever had a chance to do. And you\u2019ve asked some questions that suggest that this is a frustrating line of work to be in and actually, I don\u2019t see it that way. I think foreign policy, in general, is frustrating. Most of what we try to do that\u2019s interesting in the world, whether it\u2019s on human rights or countering proliferation or terrorism. Most of the stuff fails most of the time. I always said to my team at the State Department that it\u2019s kind of like baseball and if you\u2019re successful 30 percent of the time, you\u2019re going to the hall of fame because that\u2019s a .300 average.", "I also used to tell the folks in the Human Rights Bureau, which is what I ran \u2014 that 'you guys work for the part of the State Department that loses the most battles of any other part of the State Department.' And I pause and let that sink in and then I\u2019d say, 'You also work for the part of the State Department that wins the most battles of any other part of the organization. Now, how can that be? Because you pick the most battles of anyone. You\u2019re working on these really hard issues that inherently involve friction between us and those in the diplomatic apparatus who are mostly focused on maintaining relations with other states.' ", "And inherently, it causes friction between the United States and those other states. And so it\u2019s hard and you have to fight all the time. But we do win a lot of these fights as a country and when we do, it\u2019s one of the most satisfying things in the world. ", "So what on Earth is going on with these folks? If you had to fight a lot of fights in the previous administration, what is happening to your former colleagues now? What did you tell them as you left and left them to Donald Trump?", "You make it sound as if ...", "I know you didn\u2019t have a choice but to leave. ", " Yeah, that\u2019s true. I had to abandon ship. I told them ...", "And you were there right up until January 20th, I should note. ", "I did, and I probably spoke to almost everybody on my large team about the difficulties ahead and I told them invariably that they should stay if they were career civil servants or foreign service officers, that they should do their best to do their duty under a new president. That there would be a lot of good people coming in with Trump that probably disagreed with him on a lot of stuff, and that there would probably be opportunities to make things better. And if they got to a point where that wasn\u2019t possible; well, then they could reevaluate. ", "Right now, I think they\u2019re all in a really, really tough spot. And I don\u2019t just mean people in the Human Rights Bureau but our entire diplomatic family. I think the choice that our career diplomats are facing right now is basically this: No. 1, you can try to make things better at the margins, while explaining to your foreign counterparts that they need to bear with us. As Secretary Mattis did on a recent trip to Australia. Or you can try to lay low and work on some country or program that the president hopefully is not going to notice. And there\u2019s a lot the State Department does every day that Donald Trump is not going to think about.Or you can resign. ", "We saw a resignation just this last week with the number two \u2014 the acting ambassador in Beijing, who resigned citing the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Do you think we should expect more of that?", "I fear more of that. For the sake of the country, I hope nobody resigns because rebuilding a professional foreign and civil service is going to be really, really difficult if it, in fact, is eroded by this craziness. So I hope for our sake that folks find a way to stay. But obviously, if you are the person in that position, you have to also think about your own life and career and your own conscience. ", "Were there ways that you thought about at the time to sort of Trump-proof the system when it came to human rights? We can talk about your views on Russia. It\u2019s been reported that you and a colleague went up to Capitol Hill to talk to Sen. Cardin, who has been a big supporter of sanctions against Russia and human rights policy to talk about what could happen in order not to have the Trump administration lift sanctions on Russia. Tell us a little bit about that effort and why you think he hasn\u2019t lifted sanctions on Russia yet and then we can talk about other kinds of issues like that, where it may make a difference. ", " I think he wanted to lift sanctions. He said he did. It wasn\u2019t a surprise when we learned in the first few days of the new administration that his team was asking for options. ", "That\u2019s right. You and I talked about it at the time.", "That\u2019s right, and again, I was shocked in a way, because I thought it was a terrible idea but I was not surprised because after all, it was what he said he would do. ", " And in your view, this is very much connected with his affinity with Putin? ", "I do. I don\u2019t know about collusion. I don\u2019t know if there was a deal, but I actually think even if there was, it goes beyond that. I think Trump is basically driven by a desire to be liked and not to be disapproved of. And the Saudis and the Emiratis like him and they don\u2019t wag their fingers at him. Putin said nice things about him and our European allies that have bled and sacrificed with us in every war since the beginning of the last century; he senses that they disapprove of him and so, therefore, they\u2019re bad.", "I don\u2019t think it goes that much beyond that. I also think just Putin and Trump in some ways are similar characters. They both have authoritarian instincts. So I think there is a mutual sympathy there. I think he also likes big countries more than small countries and when you see the world in transactional terms, Russia is a much more important potential friend than say, Lithuania. Russia can do a lot more for us or to us than Lithuania. So it makes sense from that point of view. ", "So you went up to see Cardin. What was the goal of that?", "I told Sen. Cardin and others on Capitol Hill that I had heard that they were indeed moving in this direction. That they should exercise their authority to call in State Department officials for briefings to ask them what\u2019s going on. And at that point, the State Department would then tell them what\u2019s going on. And I encouraged them to move forward legislation that would codify into law the sanctions that President Obama had imposed by executive order, which Sen. Cardin, with a large bipartisan group of co-sponsors; Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain proceeded to do. ", "The think the very clear message that the Trump administration got from the Congress at that point and then the firing of Gen. Mike Flynn and the growing pressure of the Russia investigation combined to stay the president\u2019s hand.", "Was that the only issue that you felt was warranting of that level of kind of emergency attention at that point in time? Were there other issues in that transition period that you thought, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do something about now to make sure we don\u2019t get a bad outcome.\u201d ", "Well, Russia was the main thing and a number of us also endeavored to make sure that any evidence that had been gathered by our intelligence community of inappropriate behavior of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, that that evidence be preserved, that it be shared with appropriately cleared members of Congress.", " What does that mean? That you endeavored to make sure that people on Capitol Hill had copies of this? ", "Yeah, absolutely and again, we\u2019re not talking about leaks here. We\u2019re talking about senior members of Congress who had a right to know and who had access, but who needed to know what to ask for and so that was done and I think it was the right thing to do. After, of course, then after President Trump took over, there were a number of executive orders from the awful Muslim travel and refugee ban that a number of us rallied to try to oppose. There were other things that had been suggested that didn\u2019t happen. The planned designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, for example. ", "Which I think was also headed off by a lot of smart, external advocacy. ", " Right, so basically, finding out about that quickly and flagging it for people. ", "Yeah, that\u2019s right. ", "So that\u2019s a sort of a form of external resistance, if you will. ", "Yeah, perfectly appropriate. It\u2019s how the policy debate always goes, except, in this case, we felt that there were moves afoot that went well beyond the norms of what Republican or Democratic administrations would have considered appropriate in the past. ", "So that Muslim Brotherhood thing is one thing. The Russia thing is another. Are there a couple of other examples that you think are outside the norm? ", "I think the biggest thing and they tried to do it was the travel ban, which I thought was transparently an effort to limit travel to and immigration to the United States from Muslim majority countries that did not do business with the Trump organization. And I mean that literally because that was the distinction. He did not do this to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates or to Egypt or to countries which were on his nice list because he had these relationships.", "Well, look, this is obviously, a good example also of where it\u2019s not just Congress who are an external advocacy but the court\u2019s system is clearly going to make that decision. ", "Well, ultimately the courts did and I think, again, silver linings. I think we had an effort by a president to do something that was un-American and unconstitutional and that sent a very terrible message to the world about our own commitment to democracy and the rule of law. But then, our institutions responded marvelously. And in that case, the courts have so far prevented the president from implementing this order and I hope the rest of the world sees that as an example of what is good and strong about American democracy. ", "Well, as I said, you are definitely a glass-half-full optimist. The rest of the world is experiencing a lot of schadenfreude these days when it comes to what\u2019s happening inside the United States. But let me close by putting it back on you for a little bit of a lightning round. We are kind of distracted here in Washington by this sort of spectacle of the Trump White House and the leaks and who is up and who is down. What are a couple of places in the world that you think we should be paying more attention where we\u2019re not so distracted? Are there things that we\u2019re missing because of this big set of stories here at home? I\u2019m thinking this unraveling of Turkey is one good example of one place that has been on a kind of alarming trajectory. Are there other things you\u2019re watching? ", " I think even those of us who have spent years thinking primarily about foreign policy are focused mostly right now on what\u2019s going on in our own country.And I find myself picking up the newspaper and reading about something that\u2019s happening in Bahrain, or in Burma, or in Sri Lanka, or Ethiopia, or in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, countries that I care deeply about and I\u2019ve worked on and I think are important to the United States. And yet, I feel like, 'You know what? We\u2019ve got to take care of our business here because if America \u2014 there are things happening in the United States right now that make it impossible for the United States to effectively promote peace, democracy, rule of law, stability, around the world.'", "Our strength comes first and foremost from the example that we set and the questions about the integrity of our own democracy have to be settled, I think, before we can effectively play that role again. And yet, our State Department, our Defense Department, they still have to try to maintain a holding pattern in situations of crisis around the world. So yeah, no one is paying attention to Burma. No one is paying attention to Sri Lanka. How much time are we even spending on Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have been huge priorities for the United States? There\u2019s a humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic. The Ukraine. I think we have a Ukraine policy, but we used to have a State Department that was intensely engaged in trying to help that critical country in crisis build a stronger, more stable democracy. We were helping them on anti-corruption.", "We were helping them build up better rule of law. We were talking to them about protecting their media space against Russian propaganda. But not only does there seem to be no intention to do that sort of thing right now. There\u2019s really nobody to do it because we don\u2019t have any senior diplomats. ", "Strobe Talbott was my guest on the podcast a couple of weeks back and quoted a high-level Asian diplomat visitor to his office as saying, \u201cYes, I\u2019m here because Washington, DC is now the epicenter of political instability in the world.\u201d It\u2019s hard for us maybe to adjust to that fact but I guess it\u2019s a new normal. So what\u2019s next for you, Tom?", "Well, I just got back from an epic one-month vacation in Vietnam and Papua, New Guinea.", " And I should say, you look very tan and fit in the way that people who have unplugged from demanding 24-hour-a-day jobs do.", "Well, thank you. I tried to find a place that was the furthest away from all of this that I could find and I was off the internet and unplugged. ", " No Twitter?", " No Twitter, but of course, the moment we emerged from the jungle, I just had to find out what was going on with Comey.", "I was going to say, so you missed the Comey firing.", " Yes, I did. I emerged to Twitter from an Island off the coast of Papua, New Guinea, where there was no electricity, water, or internet.

If Trump tried to unravel it, Zarif said in the interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs, Iran would consider everything from \u201cwalking away from the deal to somehow accommodating Europe.\u201d", "Spend an hour with Zarif, the American-educated diplomat who brokered the agreement two years ago with Barack Obama\u2019s administration and five other major world powers, and it\u2019s clear that he thinks Iran bested Trump at the U.N. over the past couple weeks.", "After all,", "Trump publicly widened the rift with European allies even as his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson failed to persuade them privately\u2014or even make a coherent case\u2014for blowing up the nuclear accord, potentially doing long-term damage to the U.S. ability to cut deals with any number of global bad actors. \u201cThe Europeans have made it very clear to us and to the United States that they intend to do their utmost to ensure survival of the deal,\u201d Zarif said, using some of his strongest public language yet for a series of backstage meetings that made clear what a striking gap Trump has opened up between the Americans and their closest allies.", "Zarif\u2019s stinging comments about Trump\u2019s efforts come at a key decision point on Iran for the president and Tillerson. While the Iran deal crisis has been publicly overshadowed in recent days by the president\u2019s war of words with nuclear-armed North Korea, it has provoked a major behind-the-scenes battle pitting an increasingly isolated Tillerson against other Trump advisers ahead of an October 15 deadline for the president to certify Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal\u2014or send the issue back to Congress.", "Tillerson, whom Trump publicly smacked down on Twitter Sunday over his efforts to open back-channel talks with the North Koreans, has waged a lonely fight against \u201cdecertification\u201d of the Iran deal as well, according to several of those I spoke with who have been briefed on the internal debates and expect the president to overrule the secretary on this too. ", "\u201cTillerson is still trying to convince Trump,\u201d said a key outside adviser to the White House.

", "Decertification by itself would not rip up the deal and Zarif noted that the Republican-controlled Congress could decide\u2014as it has in the past\u2014not to take any action following through on Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Doing nothing would effectively leave the deal in place, Zarif argues, and besides is essentially what he calls an \u201cinternal\u201d U.S. affair, since technically the nuclear accord is a U.N. Security Council resolution and not a congressional one anyway.", "\u201cIt\u2019s up to Congress to adopt any decision, or not to adopt any decision, and I believe in the past a Republican Congress had this idea to let the nuclear agreement stay, as did our Parliament,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cIt had decided in the past not to take action; it can decide again.\u201d", "Throughout the lengthy conversation in the wood-paneled reception room of the faded Upper East Side mansion that serves as Iran\u2019s U.N. headquarters, Zarif was unsparing in his critique of Trump.

You\u2019ve seen U.S. allies saying that the United States is not a reliable partner.\u201d", "But it was equally striking what Zarif did not say. There was no Kim Jong Un-like retaliatory rhetoric, no \u201cDeath to America\u201d-type rants so familiar from past Iranian leaders. Instead, both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani were relatively restrained in their immediate response to Trump\u2019s U.N. speech\u2014Rouhani chose only to add three sentences to his U.N. address that did not mention Trump by name while warning of the hot-headed actions of a \u201crogue newcomer,\u201d and Zarif tweeted that it was \u201cunworthy of a reply.\u201d", "As much as anything, their response seemed to reflect Zarif\u2019s determination not to undercut the strong position the Iranians believe Trump has placed them in. \u201cThey think Trump has played into their hands the way he has gone after the deal,\u201d said another former U.S. official who has spoken with Zarif in recent days.", "At one point, I asked him whether Iran would also walk away from the deal if Trump went ahead with his threat to do so.", "\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Zarif said, at least not right away, what with Europe indicating it will stick with it and with Congress yet to act. \u201cWe will wait.\u201d", "***", "Ever since becoming President Rouhani\u2019s foreign minister four years ago, Javad Zarif\u2014a fluent English speaker whose international relations training came at the same Colorado graduate school that also turned out future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\u2014has been the West\u2019s favored Iranian interlocutor.", "He and Rouhani, who was just reelected to another presidential term, are seen as Iran\u2019s leading moderates, and both have staked their jobs on the survival and success of the nuclear deal they struck with the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain, France and Germany in 2015. Zarif today remains the \u201cunflappable,\u201d \u201cunflustered,\u201d \u201csmart and charming\u201d but also persnickety and at times even \u201cpetulant\u201d negotiator who haggled with the Americans over every detail, as a onetime aide to his negotiating partner, former Secretary of State John Kerry, described him to me the other day.", "But he is also seen as \u201cthe master of reading what people here\u2014in his mind\u2014ought to hear,\u201d said another former senior U.S official whose brief included Iran. \u201cHe is smart, worldly and comes across as eminently reasonable.\u201d", "There\u2019s just one problem, the official said: \u201cToo bad he doesn\u2019t make Iran\u2019s policies, especially in its region.\u201d", "That view is widespread in Washington, where most analysts consider hard-liners associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards the true decision-makers in Iran. Even supporters of the Iran nuclear deal find Zarif at times a frustrating adversary\u2014and most debate in the U.S. foreign policy circles of both parties tends to be over how to punish Iran\u2019s bad behavior, not whether it exists.", "All of which makes it more than a little jarring to talk about the politics of the Iran deal with Zarif in the midst of this latest crisis: He is the man in the middle of the international efforts to save the deal he cut, but appears to hold little sway over most of the other disputes that Washington and others have with his country, from the ongoing development of ballistic missiles that could eventually be used to deliver a nuclear warhead to backing for the murderous regime of Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad and support for Shiite proxy militias across the region.", "On the one hand, Zarif clearly has a strong case to make for his grievance about Trump\u2019s questioning of the nuclear deal. ", "The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly certified that Iran is complying with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the nuclear deal is formally known. Even Trump officials such as Tillerson and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford have publicly acknowledged in recent days that Iran is not only in \u201ctechnical compliance\u201d but that undoing the deal now would, as Dunford put it in congressional testimony, undercut future diplomacy with North Korea and others.", "\u201cIt makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there is a material breach, would have an impact on others\u2019 willingness to sign agreements,\u201d Dunford said, in a little-noticed rebuke of the president last week.", "But if Zarif is on solid ground on the letter of the nuclear deal itself, he\u2019s much shakier when it comes to defending Iran\u2019s actual behavior.", "Trump and American foreign policy hands in both parties view Iran as a destabilizing factor in the Middle East, allied with Russia and other problematic allies like Syria\u2019s Assad. Didn\u2019t he regret the enormous death toll in the Syrian civil war, I asked Zarif, where Iranian fighters and proxy militias have fought alongside Russians to keep Assad in power even as nearly half a million Syrians have been killed and millions more have been displaced from their homes?", "Zarif would hardly answer, instead deflecting blame on those who failed to consider conditions for peace talks he laid out four years ago.", "And what about Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on his own people, a repeatedly documented fact even after Assad cut a deal with the international community to supposedly remove those weapons?", "Iran, a victim of major chemical attacks by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, has long spoken out against the use of such weapons in other contexts. But in this, Zarif merely restated Iran\u2019s talking points, demanding a U.N. investigation and blaming \u201cthe United States and its allies\u201d who \u201cprevented\u201d it.", "He did not say, in our interview or in others he held over the past couple weeks, why Iran is still developing longer-range ballistic missiles\u2014only that doing so does not violate the technical language of the nuclear agreement.", "And more broadly, he left me uncertain as to why he would not consider negotiations with Trump at all\u2014given that Iran also has many grievances, including what it sees, with some legitimacy, as less-than-robust U.S. compliance with those aspects of the deal that are supposed to offer economic benefits to Iran.", " \u201cI think they don\u2019t quite know what to do with Trump other than just basically say no to everything,\u201d said one of the former U.S. officials who has spoken to Zarif in recent days.", "***", "In the end, the fight over the Iran deal may well depend on how correctly Zarif, his country\u2019s designated America-whisperer, reads the volatile new president.", "And he claims to have a pretty good fix on the place.", "\u201cI predicted Trump\u2019s victory,\u201d he tells me after we finished recording the podcast.

", "And I don\u2019t know about you\u2014you spent a lot of time there, too\u2014I don\u2019t recognize that Russia, you know. The Russia I know is a lot more like ", ", mixed with some James Bond stuff, right? It\u2019s a lot of things. And I think I sometimes overcompensate in the other direction, where I\u2019m like, you guys are just not that good. They\u2019re not that competent. ", "Well, this is a great starting point, actually, for our first segment of our conversation today, which is about the Russia as it actually is, and what do we really think about Vladimir Putin now that he has just gotten another six-year term? He\u2019s already been in power for 18 years. He\u2019s already, in fact, become the longest-serving Russian leader since Josef Stalin. ", "Here, in the West, the impression that people have is that Putin runs the whole country. This is not so, at all.", "\u2026people so easily accept this myth about this great and horrible Putin.", "I was in Russia a few months ago talking to Russians, both those who I would say are more supportive of the government and those who aren\u2019t. And all of them, to a man and woman, said, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand why you Americans are so obsessed with what Russia may or may not have done.\u201d They said, \u201cYou\u2019ve now made us into this colossus, as if we kind of control what\u2019s happening in the United States. You\u2019re really attributing to our leadership, to the Kremlin, to Putin, whatever, much greater power than we think they have.\u201d\u2026 So there\u2019s a real puzzlement there about the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.", "So I picked out a few of our interviews over the last year on The Global Politico", "that really go to this question of, are we really talking about Russia as it actually exists today? And it was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Russian wealthiest man\u2014he was then imprisoned by Vladimir Putin\u2014now a dissident who lives in London. He called it this \u201cmyth of the great and horrible Putin.\u201d", " Which is so interesting because he lost a decade of his life to this horrible Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin was, in fact, very horrible to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Vladimir Putin is horrible in a lot of ways, but here if you read the discussion or you listen to the discussion about Russia, you\u2019re not hearing about those ways. And, again, I think as you and I have talked about a lot, it\u2019s a lot about how we imagine our adversary as Americans; and for somebody to be able to come in and mess with our elections, or to stymie us in geopolitics and take over our traditional kind of\u2014I hate to use this term\u2014spheres of influence, they have to be a really mighty enemy, right? ", "They have to be really, really good. Otherwise are we not very good if we\u2019re stymied by some kind of tin-pot dictator, banana republic, where things are kind of held together with shoelaces and gum?", "Well, one of the things that you pointed out already that I think really drives a lot of this is that Americans tend to forget that while it\u2019s an authoritarian political system, it\u2019s still a political system, and Vladimir Putin is often responding to his internal need to maintain himself and his government and his regime in power, and there\u2019s another clip from Khodorkovsky where he made that point, where he said, Look, this is Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign platform, America-bashing. When he\u2019s fighting in Syria; when he\u2019s fighting in Ukraine\u2014he\u2019s fighting against the big bad West. It\u2019s a war between Russia and the West; it\u2019s not a war between Russians and Ukrainians.", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a very key thing to understand. When you\u2019re in Russia, what you hear about is, did Putin do this for external consumption or internal consumption? And a lot of I think what we don\u2019t understand is that a lot of times the song is not about us. A lot of times it\u2019s done for an internal audience, to shore up his domestic support. I mean, I think it\u2019s really telling that much of the Russian news today is not really about what\u2019s happening in Russia, not about a stagnant economy, not about corruption, not about rotten infrastructure. It\u2019s about the West, or about Russia\u2019s exploits abroad. ", "And it\u2019s about this bait-and-switch of\u2014you know, Putin\u2019s original contract with the Russian people was, you guys get wealthy or you become better off; I\u2019ll help you do that, but you in return, you stay out of politics, and you leave that to me.", "I called that his Make Russia Great Again strategy.", " Right. And then, when he returned to power in 2012, widely seen as an illegitimate return to power for his third term as president, he took on a more ideological, more revanchist kind of approach, and it became about, the economy\u2019s not doing great, but that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019re an empire again; we\u2019re great again. We are challenging the West; we are not dancing to their tune. We are not being humiliated by them and told what to do.", "And it\u2019s amazing how much it really resonates with Russians, how much it\u2019s important to them, the same way it\u2019s important to Americans to live in a great power.", "Well, and it\u2019s interesting because that was a theme of Vladimir Putin from the very beginning. So, I was there in Moscow for the first four years, basically, of Putin\u2019s presidency, when he certainly didn\u2019t have the international capabilities that he has now to basically intervene in the war in Syria, to intervene and to create a civil war on the ground in Ukraine. Back in the early 2000s, Russia really was much more of a basket case. In fact, people were still debating over, could they repay the Soviet debt in time. People were still debating over what kind of identity Putin would bring to the office of the president. ", "Well, again, it was an identity crisis, basically. We weren\u2019t sure what had happened in the first 10 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but we were pretty sure we didn\u2019t like it. And Putin came in and he played off of those feelings of insecurity and instability on the part of the Russian people. He said things are going to be stable again. But the thing that I remember so vividly that\u2019s relevant to today\u2019s conversation was that at the beginning Putin really was about restoring the Russian state internally, rebuilding power in the Kremlin. He used to call it the vertical of ", "\u2014basically, the vertical of power. And looking internally, consolidating authority; eliminating the democracy that had taken hold, if tenuously, in the first 10 years.", " Getting the oligarchs under control.", " Absolutely. Bring oligarchs under control; bring the media under control. So that was the story of the four-year period when I was there. I think what we missed, or that Putin wasn\u2019t yet ready for, was this much more internationally aggressive leader that we have today. He\u2019s now taken over Crimea\u2014that was the first armed annexation of territory since the end of World War II. ", "So, my question to you is, going forward, do you believe that now that Putin has another six-year term under his belt, is he going to be more aggressive again, internationally? Is he going to aggressively seek to revise international borders, to challenge the United States and the West elsewhere?", "I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes. I remember in 2012-2013 when the Russian economy started its kind of long decline, Russians who were very smart watching what was happening and very in tune with what has happening politically were saying, as Russia gets poorer internally, it\u2019s going to become more aggressive externally. ", "And I think that has very much been borne out since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine. Then you have Syria; you have the meddling in elections all over Europe and in the U.S., most recently being the Catalan independence movement. So, there\u2019s no referendum issue too small for Putin to get his hands in and try to kind of chip away at the transatlantic alliance, or order. ", "I think Syria and the Middle East are going to be a very interesting area to watch. Russia is now heading up the peace talks in Syria, bringing both the Turks and the Iranians to the table. America is not in those conversations at all anymore. We used to be helping to run the Geneva talks; now they\u2019ve been moved to Astana in Central Asia, in a former Soviet republic. ", "Russia talks to all sides. In the Middle East, it\u2019s seen now\u2014instead of the U.S., it\u2019s seen as the kind of reliable ally. ", "And by the way, just this week, I should point out, you have this incredible visual image of Donald Trump saying on the one hand, \u201cI want to get out of Syria immediately, as soon as possible,\u201d never mind what his advisers said or what the American policy has been. The same day, you have this incredible visual of Vladimir Putin convening regional leaders. To me, that was almost the visual representation of the post-American world order.", " Absolutely. And it\u2019s also kind of an embodiment of what Vladimir Putin wants to be and how he wants to be seen, both domestically and abroad. He wants to be seen as the great diplomat and peacemaker, and also aggressor. So, somebody who is really good with all the tools in that toolbox, that he can go to war if necessary and push back, but he is primarily the only adult in the room. ", "He\u2019s not going to start crazy, stupid wars like the Americans did in Iraq, which is constantly brought up by the Russians, when they admonished the Americans. He can convene all sides and be seen as an honest broker who actually follows through. ", " So, I think this notion of Vladimir Putin exactly as he wants to be seen is a great pivot to how he is seen in the United States today, and this Russiagate investigation. Because we\u2019re talking about Russia right now, but an awful lot of what passes for Russia conversation in Washington today, in American politics, is really not about Russia; it\u2019s about Russiagate, or whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s about the Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S. elections, the ongoing investigations of it by the Senate Intelligence Committee and, in particular, by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. ", "\"It was the hacking\u2026So, that\u2019s when the hairs really went up on the back of our necks. \u2026", "\u201cA lot of us had this Spidey sense and concerns all through \u201916 that the Russians were playing by a new playbook now, but we did not truly understand the totality of the effort\u2026\u2019", " \u201cIt\u2019s a failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11. Right? \u2026", "\u201cWe moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia. So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost.\u201d", "This, of course, from the very beginning of this Global Politico", "podcast has been a subject of ongoing and recurring conversations, both because it radically affects how Vladimir Putin is seen in the United States\u2014how does he want to be seen? Why did he intervene in our elections? Did he get what he wanted with Donald Trump? And then again, the seriousness of this investigation. We\u2019ve learned an awful lot in the course of the last year.", "When we started out at The Global Politico, we would have been astonished to know a lot of the information that has subsequently come out about contacts between the Trump campaign and various Russian envoys, emissaries, spies, and the like. We would be amazed to have learned, for example, about that summer 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Russians were openly promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to President Trump\u2019s own son and his top campaign officials. ", "So, let\u2019s talk Russiagate for a few minutes, and also what the Obama and Trump administrations did and didn\u2019t do about that. When I had Victoria Nuland on this show, she talked about the \u201cSpidey sense\u201d of the Russia experts inside the U.S. government, and how the hairs on the back of their necks were standing up when they started to realize in 2016 that Russia was running the same play inside the United States that it had run in many Eastern European countries already, intervening in their politics, and yet we didn\u2019t seem to recognize it. ", "So, I think\u2014again, this goes back to the idea of who is a worthy adversary to the U.S. I think the level of disbelief was also driven in fact by\u2014well, we\u2019re not Germany and we\u2019re not France and we\u2019re certainly not Hungary\u2014this can\u2019t happen here. And, in fact, it did. And as we\u2019re realizing also, with all the disclosures about Cambridge Analytica and the role that Facebook played, and earlier, the revelations about the role that Twitter played, and just the role of political advertising\u2014we\u2019re realizing that in some ways the Russians played the role of terrorists. They used our system, our own tools, against us. They were able to manipulate these openings on these platforms into pretty deft weapons.", " You know, I mean, I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because I\u2019ve been so struck by that. At the height of the Cold War, imagine that you told KGB agent Vladimir Putin or any of his bosses, \u201cAmerica itself is going to invent a tool by which you can have direct access to basically every single American\u2014certainly, every single American you\u2019d like to reach. It\u2019s basically going to be so cheap as to be free.

Which is kind of how\u2014", " It would have been a KGB officer\u2019s dream.", " I mean, I\u2019ve spoken to former NSA head Michael Hayden about this, and he said, \u201cYou know, the best covert operations they don\u2019t create facts or divisions on the ground. They exacerbate the ones that are already there.\u201d And in some ways, 2016 was perfect. It was this kind of perfect storm, and the Russians just were able to push it in just the right direction. ", "I think what we still don\u2019t know\u2014to me, this is the most interesting question, and also the question that probably is completely unanswerable, is what impact did it have on the election? Did people stay home and not vote because they were Bernie supporters, and they were disgusted by what came out in the DNC hack? Did people come out and vote more for Trump because they saw these ads saying that Hillary was going to let in all these Muslims? Right? Or all these illegal immigrants.", "It\u2019s so hard to gauge, right, because everybody\u2019s decision to vote is so multifaceted and multifactorial. And that\u2019s, I think, part of the brilliance of this operation. And also because it was an operation that was, as one former Obama official said, was like throwing spaghetti at the wall. They were trying all kinds of different things, and I think this is what we also\u2014just going back to what we don\u2019t understand about the Russians\u2014we think of it as because the way we Americans would do it, we would have a clear hierarchy, a clear plan; there would be, kind of everybody would be unified in their mission and their idea of what everybody\u2019s doing. ", "But in fact, in Russia, one hand didn\u2019t know what the other hand was doing, and there was a lot of turf battles going on. As we now know from some terrific reporting from Russian reporters\u2014what\u2019s left of them\u2014and the fact that actually the Russians\u2019 strength was in their disorganization, in their flexibility, in their high appetite for risk, and the fact that they were willing to try crazy things and pivot as the situation merited. That that was actually their strength.", "Right, well, combined with the still unknown questions of how much help they received in targeting and distributing this information, either by the Trump campaign or those associated with it. And that, of course, is what still remains up in the air, and your point\u2014", "But also, the other thing is that that\u2019s also hard to determine, right? Even if they did have help from the Trump organization, and it seems that the Trump organization was happy to take help from anybody. The question is, was that the deciding factor? Or, because of the internet, in addition to, like if you went back to 1983 and talked to KGB agent Vladimir Putin, and you\u2019re like, on top of this tool they\u2019re going to call Facebook, they\u2019re also going to invent this thing called the internet, and they\u2019re going to put all their political information on line.

But we\u2019re still talking about the narrow question of the 2016 election and were votes swayed, and in some ways it\u2019s very unknowable. There\u2019s two other elements of this we haven\u2019t really talked about. ", "Number one, which is how much will it directly reach the level of criminal activity? How much will it directly reach the level\u2014", " And it already has, as we\u2019ve seen.", " Exactly. So, Mueller has already issued criminal indictments; there have already been guilty pleas in the case. But it still hasn\u2019t fundamentally yet answered the question of to what extent U.S. persons, and specifically those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself\u2014did they know about this, and were they involved in it? So, that\u2019s where we all sense there is a potential political explosion coming down the road.", "And then there\u2019s this question of: And so what? What is the United States supposed to do about this? And did the Obama administration handle it correctly? Was it proactive and aggressive enough in responding to it? And then of course, what\u2019s happened since then? You and I are talking on a day when there are a whole wave of new sanctions that have been finally released that target Putin\u2019s inner circle in response to this, but for God\u2019s sakes, we\u2019re talking about this is the spring of 2018, and this intervention occurred starting in late 2014, according to Bob Mueller.", " And, as some people have pointed out, by the time these sanctions came out, mostly against oligarchs, they have had plenty of time to restructure their assets in a way where they\u2019ll be minimally affected by the sanctions.", "Still, I think it\u2019s quite a strong signal, and I think the kind of underexplored and under-noticed area that I think a lot of this will come down to is the money aspect. You know, it\u2019s a truism in journalism, and it\u2019s truer than ever\u2014follow the money. And there was a story you and I talked about that came out last month on a weekend, pretty unnoticed, the Reuters investigation that rich Russians bought about $100 million of Trump property in south Florida alone. And this has been kind of bandied about on political talk shows here, about whether or not basically Donald Trump was essentially a laundromat for dirty Russian money because he didn\u2019t ask too many questions, and needed the money because American banks wouldn\u2019t lend to him.", "But, given how\u2014and this was one of the first ways that contemporary Russians took advantage of the American political system is, they make their money at home and then get it out of the country into the West, using all the things we invented almost for them. You know, LLCs, American law firms buying their property for them that are then protected by attorney-client privilege. You know, LLCs that buy LLCs that buy LLCs that buy some property in Trump Tower.", " Right. So you could never track it back.", " And if you don\u2019t have\u2014I\u2019ve been joking with some journalist friends that if I had a superpower I\u2019d want subpoena power, because otherwise it\u2019s really impossible to follow the money these days, and I think that\u2019s one of the avenues that is going to become more kind of fleshed out and filled in as the Mueller investigation continues, I hope, because I think there\u2019s going to be a lot there.", "So, one of the things since we\u2019ve been talking about Russia and the Russiagate investigation on The Global Politico", "one of the interesting things is that the politics surrounding it, on both right and left, have gotten scrambled, and you have this element of what I would call Muller-denialism that exists on the left as well as the right, people saying basically Russiagate is a distraction; it\u2019s not that serious; we shouldn\u2019t care about it; we should really focus either on the actual threats from Russia or on the problems of President Trump from the point of view of the left don\u2019t have to do with Russia; they have to do with what Trump is doing in the United States.", "Where do you come down on that debate, because it\u2019s a pretty fierce one already?", "Yes, and it has been from the moment it kind of broke. You know, I\u2019m kind of of two minds about it. I think that the debate around it has gotten so politicized and if you\u2019re in one camp you have to say and believe the following things, and if you\u2019re in the other you have to say and believe another set of facts, or beliefs. ", "And I think the problem lies in the fact that it has become about Trump, and Trump and Republicans feel this, and so they push back. They feel, maybe correctly, that this is Democrats kind of wanting a do-over, or at the very least, undermining Trump\u2019s legitimacy. And unfortunately, yes, it is about Trump, because it was an election in which he won in a really strange way. He lost the popular vote by a massive amount of votes and then squeaked through in these areas that were completely unexpected\u2014you know, they were the blue Democratic wall in the upper Midwest.", "So, it is about Trump, but I think the media and Democrats have\u2014and I hate to lump them together\u2014but, I think they have kind of failed to make the debate not about Trump, but about national security, about the integrity of our elections, about the fact that they\u2019ll do this to anybody, they\u2019ll do this to Republicans, too, if they find that they\u2019re being too hawkish on Russia, or if they want to just stir up more chaos.", "I remember watching the Roy Moore election in Alabama, and I just thought, this is so perfect, right? All of America is watching this race in Alabama, while Russia\u2019s just cleaning up in the Middle East, at very low cost, very low cost. Like, all of our fears of intervention in Syria, Russia has shown that you can do quite effectively with very few men on the ground and very little money, actually. So, and meddling in the Catalan independence movement. ", " Right. Still a distraction.", "Right. We just become\u2014because we\u2019re prone to it the same way the Russians are prone to it\u2014we\u2019re a big country with imperial ambitions and this kind of imperialness in our DNA the way that Russians are, and it\u2019s very easy for us to turn inward and become obsessed with our own internal struggles, and not notice that the Russian thief is out back cleaning out your chicken coop. I don\u2019t know where that analogy came from, but there it is.", "Well, all right. So, let\u2019s talk about Trump. It is about Trump. And I think that\u2019s sort of our third and final aspect of our conversation today, because you can\u2019t really talk about Russia and Trump without talking about what is inside his mind.

Donald Trump has never to this day said something publicly critical of Vladimir Putin.", " As someone pointed out to me the other day, he is literally meaner to Meryl Streep than he is to Vladimir Putin, which is really quite something. And, on one hand I think Corker is absolutely right. I think he has an abiding fascination with and admiration for strongmen. He has been similarly kind to President Xi of China, Duterte of the Philippines, Erdogan of Turkey; he thinks that that\u2019s a good way to run a country, you know. He has attempted kind of a much paler version of what these guys do, of undermining the independent press. When SNL was mean to him in the very beginning of his administration, he publicly called into question NBC\u2019s broadcasting license. Very similar to those guys.", "That said, Erdogan, Xi, and Duterte did not intervene in the 2016 election with the overt goal of helping him win\u2014right?

And so you have this relatively hawkish foreign policy on Russia that\u2019s more or less supported by Democrats and Republicans. And you have the spectacle of the national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, before he was unceremoniously dumped by Trump. His last words out the door this week were a warning that the United States had failed to, in his view, adequately respond to the Russian provocations.", ": Or Rex Tillerson.

Or that he does these things\u2014again, you and I have talked about this a lot, about this split between the Trump administration, which says, do not congratulate when you talk to Putin. ", ": These are the famous talking points that were leaked to the ", " and probably sped up the firing of H.R. McMaster, probably. ", " This was the call that Trump made to Putin after his\u2014quote/unquote\u2014election on March 18", ", where he squeaked by with a nail-biting 77 percent of the vote, and it, again, came after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent. And the note said that the talking point said, \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d in capital letters. What does Trump do? He congratulates Putin.", "Not only that, but he invites him to the White House for a meeting.", "Well, then we find this out from the Russians.", " Right. And it\u2019s always\u2014", "We keep finding out\u2014the Russians are\u2014so, this is what I was getting to. Then Trump congratulates him. The talking points say, please scold him for the poisoning. He doesn\u2019t scold him. In fact, he invites him to a White House visit\u2014not just a visit. And the Russians are very ably playing off of this split. You know, he\u2019s basically given them a big opening to walk right into, and they\u2019re very ably playing the administration off the president that heads it to their own advantage, because the Russians, like the Chinese, love protocol. ", "All of these state visits are very important to them; the optics are very important to them, especially for Vladimir Putin, who wants to make Russia great again, who wants Russia to be seen as a peer to the U. S., and not as a junior partner in the relationship that is to be punished for things. What better image is there for him, after all of these diplomatic expulsions, after all of these sanctions, after\u2014again\u2014a poisoning on U.K. territory with a crazy nerve agent\u2014that he gets a photo op with the president of the U.S., in the White House that the president of the U.S. invited him to? But there is nothing more legitimizing than that, for the Russians. They\u2019re getting exactly what they want out of it.", "Even if the meeting never occurs, the timing of the leak, coming from the Russians, was very clearly weaponizing information that Trump himself had handed them. Why did they do it?", "It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve done it.", "And they did it to make it clear to people like us who are paying attention that Donald Trump is not on the same page with the tough policies coming out of his administration, number one. ", "Number two, that Donald Trump continues almost to this day to be privately acting in a very conciliatory fashion towards Vladimir Putin, and in fact, even seeking his approval. And Trump followed it up, by the way, rather than being ashamed or trying to hide this, what did Trump do? I think it\u2019s very notable that he spoke out publicly later and basically not only he confirmed it by saying, \u201cWell, yeah, shouldn\u2019t we get along with Russia?\u201d which is what he\u2019s been saying ever since the campaign.", " That\u2019s right. ", " He\u2019s never changed his rhetoric. If you actually look at what Trump himself is saying.", " It\u2019s one of the very few things on which he\u2019s been absolutely consistent. Last summer, when Congress passed\u2014this completely broken Congress passed with a veto-proof majority a mandate for new Russia sanctions, and Trump made several public statements about it saying he doesn\u2019t like this bill; he doesn\u2019t want to do sanctions against Russia. ", "The Russian political media made so much hay of it! I mean, all Russian politicians up and down the power vertical, all of Russian TV, was crowing about how the president of the U.S. wants to be friends, but the deep state is hamstringing him, and is just pointlessly against Russia, just irrationally against Russia.", " Well, this leads to the bigger-frame question. If we agree, as it seems that we do, that Trump has never wavered in either his admiration for Putin or desire somehow to reset relations, even though politically that\u2019s become very unrealistic, where does that leave the two countries? There\u2019s been this long debate that actually predates Donald Trump, but has certainly flared up anew since the election, over whether or not we are in a state of essentially a new Cold War with Russia. And everybody has a point of view on it. ", "I\u2019ve written a long piece about it. My basic takeaway is that the terminology isn\u2019t all that helpful because the first Cold War was plenty bad, and it existed in a totally different both media and information and military context, where there could be clear dividing lines between Russia and the West in a way that the current world is no longer so neat.", "[INDISCERNIBLE 00:41:02]", "And there were kind of rules and protocols of what you do, especially by the latter phase of the Cold War.", " Well, that\u2019s right. But even if you don\u2019t like the terminology, as I know\u2014clearly, the situation between the two countries is as hostile, if not more so, than at any period since the late Cold War. Arguably, during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev, we were on much better terms as a country during the, say, the George H.W. Bush administration, even during the second Reagan administration. On much better terms with the Soviet Union than we are with Russia today. ", "So, how do you view that? I mean, how scared should we be by this level of hostility?", "Personally, I\u2019m very scared. And the one question I\u2019ll add to the outstanding questions is Donald Trump\u2019s motivations. You know, for this consistently laudatory rhetoric toward Russia and Putin, and I think we still don\u2019t know the answer to that. But about the\u2014", "Why are you very scared?", " The reason I\u2019m scared is because, like I said, I think in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just\u2014the way things were done. On the Soviet side and on the Russian side. Now, you have kind of flimsier systems in place. There are fewer rules. And you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful. Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent.", "And I worry that they\u2019re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage. I also worry that Putin\u2014you know, this isn\u2019t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs.", "And this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he\u2019s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist. And I worry that in this showdown Putin\u2019s going to outmaneuver Trump and the U.S.", " Well, you know, it\u2019s interesting. Before he was thrown out, H. R. McMasters authored a new National Security Strategy for the United States. And it\u2019s actually very similar to the new national defense strategy penned by Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense. And they lump Russia together with China and basically say the age of counterterrorism, post-9/11 obsession is over, and we have to return and renew a focus as a country on the challenges that count from great powers Russia and China, that we\u2019re in a new era of competition with Russia and China.", "And arguably, that\u2019s an era that began before Donald Trump; it\u2019s likely to continue after Trump has left office, whenever that is. And so what I\u2019m struck by is that Americans\u2014even if you put aside this question of Donald Trump\u2014they\u2019re not really prepared for that kind of a confrontation, and right now, of course, you don\u2019t really have a president who is leading or shaping that. Barack Obama didn\u2019t buy into that either, by the way. Many of his advisers did, but Barack Obama demeaned and belittled Russia and basically dismissed them as insignificant in the sweep of history, a finished and doomed former superpower. Maybe that\u2019s a bit of the problem. ", "Right. So, the issue is, do we really buy and accept this notion that, rather than America as the one superpower going forward, we have entered the post-American age, the age when we will struggle\u2014not that we won\u2019t be a power, but that when we will struggle and compete with other powers like China and Russia for dominance? ", " Well, this has been a thing that Vladimir Putin has been remarkably consistent about, and in 2007, when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference, he said that basically the liberal order that was established in 1991 at the end of the Cold War is over, and we don\u2019t agree to it, and we want to rediscuss and renegotiate the terms of surrender. ", "Yes, so now we\u2019re relitigating. ", "Yes, no more unipolar world, where America calls all the shots with no friction, because we\u2019ve seen\u2014I mean, this was happening in 2007, again, four years after the invasion of Iraq and six years after the invasion of Afghanistan. And one of which\u2014the invasion of Iraq\u2014Putin was firmly against, and at that point he had been kind of proven right. Things had spiraled out of control in Iraq. And he said, you know, that\u2019s it. No more\u2014you guys can\u2019t just go around doing whatever you want, especially you can\u2019t call the shots on who gets to rule which country.", "And I think that\u2019s what Syria\u2019s about; it\u2019s kind of drawing a line and saying, \u201cAmerica cannot say so-and-so must go. It\u2019s just not within their power. And we have something to say about that, too, and we will push back in a very real way.\u201d ", " So, welcome to the future\u2026", "He\u2019s achieved it, yes.", " We will compete with Russia and China for influence, authority, power and advantage, whether military or economic.", "I mean, and I think it\u2019s helpful to\u2014getting back to your very first question about the often ignorant way in which Russia is discussed in Washington\u2014I think it\u2019s not just about pride of intellect and expertise; it\u2019s about accurately diagnosing the problem and knowing what it is you\u2019re dealing with, right? You don\u2019t want to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy.", "And I think we have to understand that Russia is going to continue throwing sand in the gears, or weightier objects, and that they\u2019re going to be a force that is constantly going to push back\u2014often just to push back. ", "And that\u2019s because it really brings us right back to the modern version of Kremlinology, which is, what\u2019s inside the head of Vladimir Putin, what\u2019s inside the head of Donald Trump at this key moment in time. And I\u2019ll leave the final word, actually, to another friend of ours, Anne Applebaum, in a conversation that she and I had a few months ago on The Global Politico", "She said, Well, we actually have a clearer sense at this point in time of what Russia\u2019s intentions are than we do of what Washington and what Donald Trump is going to do about it. \u201cImagine if we were fighting the Cold War all over again, except only one side was fighting it.\u201d And I think that\u2019s an important question to leave us with.

After the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, leaped to their defense, Trump hit back in a Sunday tweetstorm that included blaming Corker for the Iran deal he had voted against. By Sunday evening, the Senate\u2019s top foreign policy leader was calling the president of the United States a risk to put the country \u201con the path to World War III\u201d and deriding his White House as \u201cadult day care.\u201d ", "The interview with Cotton took place before this latest explosive twist, but even then it was clear a new rift of significance was opening up inside the Republican foreign policy world. I spoke with Cotton Thursday, the day after Tillerson\u2019s unusual press conference to deny press reports he was considering quitting, and just a couple hours after Cotton was summoned to the White House for a private Oval Office meeting with Trump to discuss the Iran strategy. In the interview, Cotton did not really try to paper over the rift or offer the usual assurances that it would all be papered over. Instead, when I asked him directly whether there would be resignations, Cotton did not say there wouldn\u2019t be, only that he did not believe they were \u201cimminent.\u201d ", "Cotton, an ambitious Harvard graduate and veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who has only just turned 40 as he serves his first Senate term, was similarly coy when I asked at the end of our conversation whether he would consider leaving the Senate for a major Trump administration post should one become available, saying only that he liked his current job in the Senate.

When I listed the areas he seemed to disagree with Trump on \u2013 a long list that covered everything from Russia policy to blowing up trade deals \u2013 Corker at the time fretted about a head-on collision with such a confrontational figure as Trump.

Corker, who recently decided not to run for reelection, has been acting like a man liberated to speak his mind about Trump, as his explosive interview last night with the ", " showed, and he now seems entirely unwilling to back down from the confrontation he once feared. ", "Which makes it all the more interesting to talk Trump and foreign policy for an hour with Cotton amid the escalating feud. ", "Because Cotton today is one of the few Senate Republicans who pay close attention to foreign policy who is still out there making Corker\u2019s initial case for engagement with Trump, and he insists it\u2019s paying off with substantive shifts in Trump\u2019s thinking on subjects as varied as how to deal with Russia and the continuation of the war in Afghanistan. ", "Screen out some of the inflammatory rhetoric, Cotton maintains, and \u201cI would submit that his foreign policy, over these first nine months in office, is much more in keeping with the bipartisan tradition of foreign policy, starting with Truman in 1945 and going through George Bush in 2009, than President Obama\u2019s policy was,\u201d Cotton says. \u201cIn almost every area, in his own way, with his own rhetoric, he has reasserted American leadership, and he\u2019s willing to confront threats before they gather.\u201d ", "In the interview, Cotton argues that Trump\u2019s national security team \u201cchanged for the better on two occasions\u201d so far in his short tenure. The first came when Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and brought in Cotton\u2019s recommendation, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. The second came when the president fired his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replaced him with John Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general also touted by Cotton. \u201cI can see that from where I sit and the kind of interactions we have with the White House and my office, before and after both of those,\u201d he says. ", "Cotton also says the fact that the two generals are both steeped in the military chain of command is a plus when dealing with the prickly president.", "\u201cThey understand they\u2019re not the president,\u201d Cotton says in what seems at least an implicit nod to the view among the commentariat that the generals are there to oversee, or even constrain, Trump, from his own worst impulses. \u201cDonald Trump is the president. Their job is to advise. His job is to decide. Their job is to make sure he has the best facts, the best thinking, presented to him in an orderly fashion and ready for decision. But he decides and they move out and execute. ", "As for substantive policy shifts, Cotton cites Afghanistan, where McMaster, Mattis and Tillerson spent months persuading Trump \u2013 against all his instincts, as the president later publicly acknowledged \u2013 to double-down on the war that just hit the 16-year mark this week by sending several thousand additional troops. ", "\u201cThat\u2019s the way the policymaking process should work,\u201d Cotton says in a response that seems worth quoting in full: ", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a cabinet member, when you\u2019re a senior advisor in the White House, and the president is right, you should help him achieve his objectives and run with his thinking. When you think the president is wrong, you have a duty to try to present to him the best facts and the best thinking to help him see it in a different light. Maybe you can, but if he doesn\u2019t, and he says, \u2018No, I want to do it my way,\u2019 then your job is to move out and execute. And if you feel strongly enough, then you have to resign. \u201c", "Which, of course, brings us right back to the present moment \u2013 and the rift that the Iran deal seems to have opened up on Trump\u2019s already conflicted team.", "Until now, Trump has shied away from outright confrontation with the experienced hands he\u2019s hired to oversee his national security policy. But the Iran deal now seems to have finally forced a public rupture. ", "Cotton, who has repeatedly consulted with Trump and other top White House officials in recent days, appears to be on the winning side, pushing Trump to adopt the formula his administration has now settled on of refusing to re-certify the Iran deal to Congress but holding off \u2013 for now \u2013 asking Congress to blow it up by imposing new sanctions. Iran \u201cis on the president\u2019s mind right now, probably more than anything,\u201d Cotton says, and he says he believes Trump will take the step of not certifying as a way to send \u201ca very important signal to Congress and to our E.U. plus three partners and to Iran that this president is not going to abide by a disastrous nuclear deal.\u201d ", "Beyond the rhetoric, though, Cotton acknowledges the idea is not \u201cto re-impose sanctions immediately\u201d \u2013 an act that would be tantamount to blowing up the agreement \u2013 but instead give \u201ccoercive diplomacy\u201d time to work. Cotton envisions Trump using the threat of imminent congressional action \u2013 Cotton declines to say how long, but suggests a deadline of \u201cweeks or months\u201d \u2013 to get U.S. allies in Europe and the Mideast on board with a plan to revisit the deal with Iran and secure more concessions on areas such as Iranian ballistic missile development, which is continuing and outside the deal right now; and ending the so-called \u201csunset clause\u201d after which Iran might be free to resume its nuclear program.", "Tillerson and Mattis have reportedly signed off on the final plan, which Trump is supposed to make public in a speech this week in advance of an October 15 deadline for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the deal to Congress, as he is legally required to do every 60 days. But multiple sources have said that Tillerson privately lobbied Trump hard in favor of certification at least one more time, while Mattis, queried directly about this in his Senate testimony the other day, went public with his view that the deal in its current form remains \u201cin the national interest\u201d \u2013 precisely the opposite of what Trump is set to declare this week.", "Cotton gave a lengthy address at the Council on Foreign Relations the same day as Mattis\u2019 testimony taking the opposite view \u2013 and a link to it was soon tweeted out approvingly by an Iran deal hardliner inside the administration, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. ", "I asked Cotton about that Mattis statement, and how Trump should proceed given the obvious \u2013 and clearly consequential \u2013 moment of potential rift with the Pentagon chief. Even before last week\u2019s all but open break with Tillerson, Trump had often expressed frustration over the secretary of state, but he has yet to really feud with Mattis almost alone among his top officials. ", "\u201cOn that specific point, I simply disagree with him,\u201d Cotton told me of Mattis. \u201cAt root, though, we don\u2019t have secretaries of state and secretaries of defense to make these decisions. We elect a president, who\u2019s democratically accountable to the American people. And they say, in baseball, that the longest 18 inches is the difference between the assistant coach\u2019s seat on the bench and the manager\u2019s seat.

He didn\u2019t publicly blast Trump\u2014he called him on the phone.", "When Trump, to his surprise, picked up, Clapper recounted, \u201cI attempted to impart to him what a national treasure he was inheriting in the form of the U.S. intelligence community, that was standing by to do everything it could to help him and support him in the very difficult job he was taking on, where information\u2014and, specifically, intelligence\u2014was going to be invaluable in helping him make decisions and gauge risk. And so, I, again, felt I couldn\u2019t let that pass, and I needed to attempt to defend the community.\u201d", "Clapper told me his own realization about Russia\u2019s attack on the U.S., combined with Trump\u2019s refusal to accept it, had prompted his turn toward public activism. He described the election hacking as his \u201cwake-up call,\u201d and said he had concluded that Russia remains a \u201cprofound threat\u201d to the United States to which Trump\u2019s administration has so far shown \u201cindifference.\u201d", "In our conversation, Clapper contrasted Trump\u2019s focus on undermining the Iran nuclear deal forged by Obama, despite international observers\u2019 repeated finding that Iran is in compliance with the deal, with what appears to be indifference toward more significant Russian arms-control violations of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. \u201cIf you look at what Russia is trying to do to undermine us, and the modernization of their strategic nuclear forces\u2014and they only have one adversary in mind when they do that\u2014I just find it worrisome, bothersome, that there isn\u2019t more focus on the threat posed by Russia,\u201d he said.", "But Clapper doesn\u2019t comment about just Trump and Russia these days. ", "He also ranged widely from his worries about the standoff with North Korea to last week\u2019s Communist Party Congress in China to the recent controversy involving White House chief of staff John Kelly and whether it signals an overreliance by Trump on current and former generals in positions meant for civilians.", "\u201cI just thought it was terrible,\u201d he said, referring to the public fight between the White House and a military wife who lost her husband in an attack in Niger and said she was offended by Trump in a condolence call. Kelly, in the course of that fight, complained bitterly about a congresswoman who listened in on the Trump call, even misrepresenting a speech she had given, and appearing to lecture Americans on why only that small percentage of citizens who have served in the military could understand the nature of their sacrifice. ", "He took particular issue with White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 comment that Kelly\u2019s word about the congresswoman should not be second-guessed because he had been a four-star general, a remark Clapper called \u201cabsurd.\u201d ", "\u201cOnce you\u2019re out of uniform and you\u2019re in a political position\u2014which he\u2019s in\u2014people do listen to that, but I don\u2019t believe that entitles any of us to being unquestioned. It would have been great for me in the 16 years that I served in civilian capacities after I left the military if, well, I got a pass. No one is ever going to question anything I said or did. Well, they certainly did, and that is appropriate in our system,\u201d Clapper said.", "More generally, I asked whether Clapper\u2014who retired from the military in 1995 but still carries the bearing of his three decades in the Air Force\u2014worried about the Trump era as the new age of militarized government, not only with Kelly as chief of staff but also a sitting lieutenant general, H.R. McMaster, as national security adviser, and a former general, James Mattis, as defense secretary. Clapper said that while he has \u201ca visceral aversion\u201d to generals \u201cfilling these political, civilian positions,\u201d he\u2019s nonetheless \u201cglad they\u2019re there.\u201d ", "In particular, he added, Mattis \u201ccarries perhaps a greater burden than any of his predecessors.\u201d The comment sounded ominous, but it remained spymaster-cryptic; when I pressed for explanation, Clapper didn\u2019t offer any. ", "He did, however, suggest that Mattis will have a tough task ahead with Pyongyang, where Clapper\u2014who early in his intelligence career served as an analyst responsible for North Korea\u2014said he fears that \u201csome of this intemperate, bellicose rhetoric\u201d between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could lead to a \u201ccataclysmic\u201d war.", "The risk, he said, came primarily from Kim miscalculating as a result of Trump\u2019s heated words.", "\u201cKim Jong Un doesn\u2019t have any advisers that are going to give him objective counsel. He\u2019s surrounded by medal-bedecked sycophants, who dutifully follow him around like puppy dogs with their notebooks open, ascribing his every utterance, and pushing back against the great leader is not a way to get ahead,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cAnd so I do wonder what Kim Jong Un\u2019s ignition point is, when some insult that\u2019s been hurled at him by the president will just ignite him.\u201d", "***", "Inevitably, though, any conversation with James Clapper these days begins and ends with Trump and Russia. ", "I asked him as our interview neared an end to put his intelligence analyst hat on and answer perhaps Washington\u2019s No. 1 parlor game question: Does he think Trump will serve out his full term?", "Yes, Clapper answered, \u201cI do. I think it would take a lot to remove him from office. The 25th Amendment that people bring up is a very, very high bar for removal, and appropriately so. And if that were to happen\u2014and let\u2019s just say for the sake of discussion there were an impeachment, even less likely a conviction\u2014all that would serve to do is heighten the polarization and the divisiveness, because the base will never accept that, and that would just feed the conspiracy theories.\u201d ", "In the end, he is still more intelligence analyst than advocate. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Clapper concluded, \u201cthat an outcome like that\u2014the president\u2019s removal\u2014would be a good thing.\u201d", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    Updated ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                                ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

In an important prerequisite for this job, he has developed a trust and rapport with Clinton, which had a lot to do with his unexpectedly strong showing in the veepstakes. There\u2019s some thought that Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor and state attorney general who left as Obama\u2019s homeland security secretary after years of waiting to be attorney general, might want back in from her current job running the University of California system.

Jennifer Granholm, who previously served as her state\u2019s attorney general, is seen as a possibility, as is Tony West, the former No. 3 in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, and Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general under Bill Clinton. There\u2019s also some speculation that Vilsack, who\u2019s a lawyer but has never held a position focused on the law in government, could fit here. Preet Bharara, the hard-charging United States attorney in New York, has long been seen as having his eyes on this job \u2014 but people close to Clinton point out that he might have proved himself a little too hard-charging and independent to be someone she\u2019d want in this job.", "\n                            Tom Perez is seen as a likely candidate to become Clinton's Attorney General.", "John Podesta got pulled back in as an adviser to Obama, and then as Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.

Steve Beshear, who oversaw one of the most successful state implementations in a reliably Republican state, could be a possibility, though some around Clinton suggest that this might be a good spot to lean more toward an inside player than a familiar face.

In effect, he\u2019s a Republican president with a very un-Republican foreign policy, and he\u2019s outlined a set of global shifts that are not only at odds with GOP orthodoxy but often in conflict with each other.", "Something, Corker says, has got to give: \u201cThe challenge is going to be\u2026 so you want to do deals, deals, deals.

McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has so far criticized Trump publicly on a proposed torture executive order, considering lifting sanctions on Russia, his temporary refugee ban, and the apparently botched U.S. special forces raid in Yemen\u2014putting him in a running smackdown with the president on Twitter and cable TV.", "But Corker, who has made it his mission as chairman to reinsert Congress in foreign policy decisions from which the Hill has increasingly been cut out in recent decades, is eager to find another course.", "\u201cI wish some of the things that were said and tweeted didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says, and he was quicker than many Hill Republicans to publicly criticize Trump\u2019s \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d temporary refugee ban (a statement that drew an angry phone call from the White House within 20 minutes of him issuing it on a Sunday afternoon, Corker says). Still, he insists there are glimmers of hope that could be converted into a course of action by Republicans in Congress.

In other words, he\u2019s an increasingly rare species on Capitol Hill, and he largely stayed out of the divisive 2016 presidential race. He never formally endorsed Trump but he wasn\u2019t a #NeverTrumper either \u2013 and he even met Trump briefly to discuss the vice presidential nod before withdrawing from consideration. In the fall, he joined in the chorus of criticism after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape became public, saying an apology was in order.", "Soon after Trump\u2019s election upset, Corker ended up on the short list for secretary of state, pushed by fellow senators who saw him as confirmable when compared with bombthrowers like Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton also in the mix, and he was summoned to the gilded tower in New York for a Tuesday, Nov. 29 meeting with Trump and key advisers like Vice President Mike Pence and chief ideologist Steve Bannon.", "At the interview, Corker found himself doing a quick survey of global hot spots with the president-elect.

I did find myself in most cases \u2013 in almost every case but maybe one \u2013 offering an alternative view,\u201d Corker says of his conversation with Trump.", "Participating in Trump\u2019s reality-show contest for the job, which ultimately went to ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, was clearly a bruising experience. Conservative websites attacked Corker for not sufficiently opposing President Obama\u2019s Iran deal; they argued he had in fact facilitated its passage by the procedural way it was handled in the Senate, a charge he insists in our interview is nonsense (\u201cit\u2019s almost as if some people want to make things up\u201d). The conservative Daily Caller website even reported he had not won the job because the looks-obsessed new president considered him of insufficient stature for the post (though another site pointed out that Corker, at 5\u20197\u2019\u2019, is in fact the same height as Vladimir Putin).", "\n                            Bridget Mulcahy/Politico", "Regardless of the real reason he didn\u2019t get the nod, Corker, like many Republicans, disagrees strongly with Trump on key foreign policy issues. The matter of what to do about Russia, and in particular Trump\u2019s persistent compliments for its tough-guy leader, is perhaps most vexing.", "\u201cThe Russia issue is the one that has most unsettled people,\u201d Corker says, and he wants to make clear that no matter what Trump says, \u201cI do not see Russia as a friend of the United States in any form or fashion.\u201d", "So what\u2019s up with the Trump-Putin mutual admiration society? Corker says he thinks the American president does in fact have \u201ca degree of admiration for a strongman. I\u2019m sorry. I think that part is somewhat real,\u201d though he argues that the allure of a new friendly relationship with Russia may be as much about Trump\u2019s expansive self-perception as a figure who can achieve what other American presidents have not.", "Still, he fears that his colleagues like McCain and Graham, though he doesn\u2019t name them, will end up fighting ineffectively with Trump by challenging him frontally. \u201cIs that really the best way to approach a double-down kind of president? Or is it best to help the team and others evolve to a different place? Is that a better approach? That\u2019s the approach right now that I\u2019m taking.\u201d", "But like the rest of Washington, Corker is still figuring out who\u2019s actually in charge in the Trump White House and how to get things done given the multiple power centers that seem to be shaping foreign policy. A case study: Just last week, newly sworn-in Secretary of State Tillerson brought his choice for deputy, veteran Republican foreign policy hand and well-known neocon Elliott Abrams, to the White House to have him meet Trump for an appointment that seemed settled. According to several sources with whom I\u2019ve spoken, the Abrams choice, pushed by both Tillerson and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been held up for weeks by objections from Bannon \u2013 and was ultimately nixed by the president after Trump was reminded of Abrams\u2019s critical statements about him during the campaign.", "As for the national security adviser, many in the Washington foreign policy world \u2013 in both parties \u2013 have been deeply suspicious of Trump\u2019s reliance on Mike Flynn, the hawkish anti-Iran and seemingly pro-Russian former general whose potentially improper pre-inauguration discussions with the Russian ambassador are being investigated. But the establishment has worried not only about his Russia ties but also his fundamental competence and fitness for the job, blaming him for contributing to the disarray and confusion of the administration\u2019s early days with a lack of clear staffing and organization and a paranoid culture in which professionals are being kept out of key national security decisions.", "Still, Corker met with Flynn at the White House a few days before our interview and came away with a different view than he expected. ", "\u201cLook, I see a person who\u2019s setting up shop much like Brent Scowcroft did,\u201d Corker says, invoking the mild-mannered former military man revered by the foreign policy set for his disciplined, well-ordered tenure as George H.W. Bush\u2019s national security adviser during the tumultuous period of the end of the Cold War. \u201cIt\u2019s not what people thought, where he was going to be an autocrat,\u201d Corker adds, seeing early signs of Flynn \u201ctaking input\u201d from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Tillerson and \u201ccreating a real interagency process.\u201d", "But then again, Corker, like the rest of us, doesn\u2019t really know yet.", "\n                                            ", "\n                                        ", "\n                                            By ", "That becomes clear once again when we turn back to the question of Iran.

But that\u2019s a course not even favored these days by the Republicans on Capitol Hill and Israelis like Netanyahu, who had been its staunchest foes while Obama was pushing it.", "Will Trump go along with what even his would-be supporters think is the wisest course, of pressuring the Iranians rather than walking away from the agreement?

", " Of course, it remains an open question whether the Republicans will stay on pace with the fast-moving Democrats in 2016, when many of the Obama alumni consider joining Team Hillary or other campaigns, national and local, with new innovations to match. ", " But the story of how the Republicans came to embrace technology is arguably one of the hidden keys to the party\u2019s success in the 2014 midterms. It didn\u2019t create the wave that elevated so many Republicans, but it may well have ensured that candidates like Gillespie were able to make the most of it. One challenge for the GOP\u2019s continued success, many strategists believe, will be whether the party\u2019s underfunded insurgents can learn from races, like Gillespie\u2019s, that used technology in a smart, cost-effective way. ", " Over the final two months of the campaign, POLITICO got an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Gillespie\u2019s state-of-the-art digital operation that helped him become this cycle\u2019s most striking almost-winner. From the start it was a fittingly obsessive focus for the operation of a campaign insider: Gillespie had been chairman of the Republican National Committee under Bush and watched the party\u2019s historic tech advantage slip away; now, himself a candidate, he pumped out thousands of social media posts, translated his campaign website into six different languages spoken across the state, targeted voters with hundreds of tailored online ads and mined the national party\u2019s real-time database to find and contact more than 1 million potential supporters through old-fashioned door knocks and phone calls. ", " It almost worked. ", " *** ", " As the RNC chairman during Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, Gillespie saw firsthand what microtargeting could accomplish by sending out different messages to different potential voters. ", " \u201cAt that point, buying time on the Golf Channel was seen as a big thing,\u201d he recalled, as if remembering one of Harry Truman\u2019s whistle stops. ", " Just 10 years later, campaigns like the one Gillespie just mounted for Senate have a rapidly proliferating array of sophisticated new methods for connecting with voters, from streaming video ads on Hulu and YouTube to reaching people on their smart phones, mobile apps and tablets. Add in Facebook, Twitter and other social media, and candidates now have the ability to bypass reporters and speak directly to voters. ", " For Gillespie, technology was primed to be a great equalizer as he entered the Senate race in January, with Warner having already banked $7 million. Polls from the get-go put the Republican down more than 20 points against his Democratic rival, a popular former governor. He was also running in a state where TV advertising can be inefficient at best \u2014 there are eight different markets, crossing borders like North Carolina, West Virginia and Tennessee, as well as the pricey Washington, D.C., market, where two-thirds of viewers aren\u2019t even in Virginia.

A few days earlier the group had posted horrific video of the beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, and calls for a severe response were growing fast. The United States was already conducting limited air strikes in Iraq to try to halt the group\u2019s alarming spread across the country, but Obama\u2019s advisers now were recommending more controversial strikes across the border in Syria. ", " Yet Obama, who had fended off calls for military action in the region for more than two years at such meetings despite pleas from his advisers, was still frustrated with his options. While he grasped the urgency of the ISIL threat, Obama said, he still wasn\u2019t convinced he had a coherent plan to justify action in Syria. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet,\u201d he had said a day earlier, drawing chortles from his critics. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019ve got clear plans.\u201d In private, he reiterated that view to his national security team. ", "Story Continued Below", " After the meeting, Secretary of State John Kerry called together his top aides and asked them to work through the weekend to produce a memo that would answer Obama\u2019s question. The document \u2014 which spelled out a comprehensive strategy that included military, diplomatic, humanitarian and communication efforts \u2014 argued that Syria and Iraq could not be treated as two separate theaters, and helped to sell the reluctant president on strikes in Syria, which began two weeks later. Obama called the war he\u2019d been so wary of starting a \u201crelentless effort\u201d to help ensure that \u201cthose who offer only hate and destruction [are] vanquished from the Earth.\u201d ", " ( ", ") ", " But two months later, Obama is once again seeking strategic clarity amid mixed results on the ground and a rising call of complaints that he launched the war without fully committing to doing what was necessary to win it. Even as Obama dispatched another 1,500 troops to Iraq Friday, nearly doubling the existing force \u2014 and with a new senior general headed to the country soon, according to a Defense Department source \u2014 coalition allies and his own secretary of defense are warning that his war plan needs a rethink. ", " That problem has been compounded \u2014 according to interviews in recent days with more than a dozen current and former administration officials, experts and diplomats \u2014 by a lack of senior officials with deep expertise in Iraq and Syria and by a policymaking process hounded by rivalries and unclear leadership. Kerry\u2019s State Department has clashed with the Pentagon, Congress is complaining about not being consulted \u2013 and officials say there\u2019s no clear very senior owner of the war in the White House since the president finally made the call to embark on it. ", " \u201cNo one\u2019s in charge of the policy. That\u2019s a really big problem,\u201d said one former U.S. government official with detailed knowledge of the ISIL fight. ", " In Obama\u2019s first term, that person was Vice President Joe Biden: \u201cJoe, you do Iraq,\u201d Obama told Biden in mid-2009. But Biden\u2019s role has receded since the December 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. As a result, when ISIL rampaged through Iraq earlier this year, U.S. policy toward the country it occupied at the cost of so much blood and treasure just a decade ago was managed by a mid-level State Department official \u2014 former George W. Bush aide Brett McGurk, who had been called back into service by a shorthanded administration desperate for his detailed knowledge of Iraq\u2019s political dynamics. ", " ( ", ") ", " The September appointment of retired Marine General John Allen as a special State Department envoy to manage the anti-ISIL coalition added gravitas and experience, and in the seven weeks since McGurk and Allen have traveled to 13 foreign capitals seeking allies and troop commitments to aid the American effort, with the pair becoming the unlikely public face of a war that no one else seems to own. ", " Allen\u2019s naming added a new player with influence but not true authority and rankled turf-conscious Defense Department officials who didn\u2019t hide their annoyance that a senior general had joined the effort outside the military chain of command. Several people interviewed described a slow-moving process involving endless meetings and deliberation without action, along with basic uncertainty about who in the administration is really in charge. ", " Asked about this, a top administration official argued that any complex policy \u2013 never mind one that involves a multi-front war in two countries \u2013 includes many voices. \u201cAs with any issue you\u2019ll find multiple people who do multiple aspects,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find one who runs China.\u201d ", " Regardless of who\u2019s running it, few dispute that Obama\u2019s war against ISIL is off to a frustratingly slow start. After hundreds of U.S. airstrikes, the militant group still holds vast swaths of territory in both civil war-torn Syria and Iraq, including Iraq\u2019s second-largest city of Mosul. Dozens of American strikes have failed to rescue the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane along the Turkish border; a planned program to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIL has yet to commence; and members of Congress from both parties, along with foreign allies, complain that the campaign appears half-hearted and more about containing ISIL than truly destroying it, as the president has vowed. ", " ( ", ") ", " After weeks of such complaints, Obama\u2019s Friday announcement of the 1,500 additional troops to Iraq seemed to implicitly acknowledge the criticism and a weekend airstrike appears to have hit senior ISIL figures, possibly even the group\u2019s self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. (A Pentagon official could not confirm those reports on Sunday.) But some military planners continue to insist that defeating ISIL will eventually require placing thousands of American troops near the battlefront, in the form of Special Forces and forward air controllers who can designate highly accurate air strike targets. ", " \u201cThere are obviously differing views on the policy,\u201d a former senior U.S. commander said in an interview. \u201cShould there or not be joint tactical air controllers on the ground? Should there be special forces liaisons or forward adviser teams?\u201d ", " \u201cNo one\u2019s in charge of the policy. That\u2019s a really big problem,\u201d said one former U.S. government official with detailed knowledge of the ISIL fight. ", " As for Syria, Obama has called for the departure of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, but he has not made Assad a target of the military campaign, insisting the fight for now is limited to taking out ISIL \u2014 despite the pleas of America\u2019s Sunni allies in the region and moderate Syrian rebels who are being enlisted as ground forces in the anti-ISIL fight. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently sent Obama his own memo asking what one Defense Department official calls \u201chard questions about the degree to which our strategy needs to change.\u201d In particular, Hagel urged more clarity on U.S. policy toward Assad. This followed remarks by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey publicly differing with the White House on whether U.S. ground troops might eventually be needed to defeat ISIL. ", " As Obama grasps for a winning policy, he is hamstrung by an expertise deficit on the two countries it now finds itself bombing. After U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011, the Obama team failed to maintain a deep roster of officials fluent in the country\u2019s complex sectarian and tribal relationships. In the past two years, meanwhile, Obama\u2019s two top Syria hands \u2014 Ambassador Robert Ford and State Department adviser Fred Hof \u2014 departed in frustration over what they have described as a hapless U.S. policy, taking their granular knowledge of the Syrian opposition with them. ", " President Obama meets with members of the recently formed special presidential envoy for the coalition to counter the Islamic State group and some of his advisers. | Doug Mills/The New York Times ", "\n  ", " ", " The current U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Stuart E. Jones, arrived in June from a posting in Amman, Jordan. His predecessor served less than two years in the country. The State Department\u2019s new top Syria official, Daniel Rubenstein, arrived in March from Jerusalem. Meanwhile, there is no senior U.S. military commander in Iraq today. The air campaign is managed from Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, by Centcom chief Lloyd Austin \u2014 although that will soon change, according to a Defense Department official. The Pentagon plans to send a three-star general to Iraq soon to manage the effort from there. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point of maturity where we need a command structure,\u201d the official said. ", " Back in Washington, the Iraq account in the White House technically belongs to a relatively junior national security aide, Andrew Kim. Biden stepped back from his lead role months ago, before the rise of ISIL, in part because the White House wanted to begin normalizing its relationship with Baghdad. But Biden still makes regular phone calls to senior Iraqi leaders\u2014including two in three days last month to Iraq\u2019s new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, one of them hours before Abadi\u2019s October 20 visit to Tehran.

Yesterday, we rolled out part one, a frank and at times disturbing conversation with six bad-ass women who\u2019ve worked in the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the State Department in recent years. They talked about men watching porn on their office computers, Special Forces dudes walking around the office in their underwear. \u2018We thought It was just the cost of doing business in the Pentagon,\u2019 said one of the women. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to it, I hope you will. ", "And now, today\u2019s episode takes us back to the Pentagon \u2014 and the Bad Old Days if you will, when there really weren\u2019t ANY women in national security, as in zero, zip, nada. Congresswoman Pat Schroeder was a key figure in changing that, she served in Congress for 24 years, even ran for president. A Colorado Democrat, she was on the Armed Services Committee, and she joined us on a recent visit to Washington to talk about what it was like to wage that lonely crusade in the 80s and 90s\u2014and all the resistance she faced. Then we\u2019ll hear from Deborah James, the second woman secretary of the Air Force. She served under President Obama, and actually was involved in some horrific cases while she was there \u2014 including disciplining a retired four-star general who forced a subordinate to have sex. Why didn\u2019t that case go national when all these other sensational new allegations are? We\u2019ll talk about that and more\u2026 but first: former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. ", "Story Continued Below", " I\u2019m former congresswoman Pat Schroeder. I was on the Armed Services Committee for all 24 years I was in Congress. So I saw lots of women have all sorts of problems.", "Well, that\u2019s right and especially in this national security world, as we were talking about, women are a minority of a minority and have been for a long time. So you have the broader problems of the political world that you operated in and of course, Congress, which is not exactly a bastion of progressive thinking, either, then or now. But then how does the national security space specifically do you think differ from those other areas?", "Well, first of all, it\u2019s been a very hard, hard pull for these young lionesses. I was the one who pushed to get them into the different academies, which people didn\u2019t want to do, and obviously, those are their sacred spots and worked very hard to try and get them to have all sorts of slots. I\u2019m a pilot, so I couldn\u2019t see any reason they couldn\u2019t fly and there isn\u2019t any reason they can\u2019t fly. They deal with gravity better than men. That\u2019s a dirty old secret but nevertheless, same with getting them into space. They didn\u2019t want to send them into space. They didn\u2019t want to send them anywhere and I had all sorts of horrible experiences coming from Colorado. The speaker put me on the board of overseers at the Air Force Academy. And the Air Force Academy is probably the most advanced of the services, anyway. So they invited me out, land at the Air Force Academy, drags in these young men and he sits there like this and he says, \u201cTell this woman what you think of her idea to let girls in here.\u201d", "\u201cGo ahead, speak freely.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it might be better if you left.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. Speak freely in front of me. Go ahead, tell them.\u201d So obviously, even the young men knew that all the way through the top command, this was something we imposed on them. This was like some kind of an experiment or some terrible thing. And it was interesting because the young man would say things like, \u201cWell, they could wear their hair long.\u201d And I\u2019d say, \u201cDo you want to wear your hair longer?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDoes it interfere with the mission?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, they can wear earrings. Does it interfere with the mission? Do you want to wear it here?\u201d We would just go on and on and they couldn\u2019t\u2014", " And this was in the 1980s? ", " Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So this was right before we finally got permission to get them into the academies. So then, one of the things that really troubled me was we did get them in the academies and the Air Force Academy asked that I not be put back on the board. They really were not fond of my term.", " Were there other women on the board?", " No, no. And so then I start watching what\u2019s happening to this incoming class and they\u2019re all suffering from amenorrhea. And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh, my goodness, this did not happen when they desegregated Harvard and Yale. So the pressure must be horrendous and you begin to think, \u201cOh, gracious.\u201d ", "And my favorite story just to end on the Air Force Academy is I\u2019m on the floor one day and I get this call, \u201cGo talk to colonel so-and-so from the Air Force Academy.\u201d I get on the phone in a cloakroom and he says, \u201cDamn you. It finally happened. We knew it would happen.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, could you back up and tell me what \u2018it\u2019 is?\u201d \u201cA cadet six months pregnant. We\u2019ve thrown her out.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, well, was there anyone else implicated?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cNo, none of the males are implicated.\u201d And I said, \u201cWould you please look out the window? Is there a star over the Air Force Academy? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this in several thousand years.\u201d", "Well, he threw the phone down and that was the end of it. So they never thought I was very funny. But that type of tension was just incredible that these young lionesses went through. You saw it also, the harassment that you got, Tailhook being one of the many things. I got very involved in the Tailhook thing because there was this one wonderful young woman finally willing to come forward. And as the military women would tell me on the side, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know our options. We know our options stink. Oh, yeah. We could go report it. Who do you report it to? The head of your command, he may be the one harassing you or he may be the one who thinks it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d So where do you go with these stories? And this young woman\u2019s father and grandfather had both been in the Navy and they were like, \u201cNavy men aren\u2019t to act that way and we\u2019re going to stand behind you,\u201d and took on the whole Tailhook thing. Which was very brave of her. ", "This was in 1986?", " Right, and on and on it went. But the Tailhook thing had been running for years with huge numbers of women being assaulted, not just military women. Anybody that happened to be walking through that hallway.", "Did things get better as a result of all the attention to Tailhook? One thing that depressingly is striking to me is that we have had these repeated public moments of scandal around sexual harassment. There was Tailhook and then there was Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. There have been just in the last few years in the media, these enormous stories about Bill Cosby and O\u2019Reilly and the like and yet, it\u2019s not clear to me that these have been anything other than sort of episodic moments. ", " Well, and the hope that so many of us had would be that the younger generation, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem and then suddenly, you read all about what\u2019s going on out in Silicon Valley, which would tend to be younger. So you take deep breaths and say, \u201cHow do we keep working on this?\u201d I think eventually, a lot of the women have really shown their courage in all of this and eventually, it starts to change. But there was such a feeling of, \u201cWe don\u2019t want women.\u201d One of the most surprising things that ever happened to me as I was doing a morning show on ABC where I was talking about getting women into all of the slots that they qualified for. ", "And when I got done, the cameraman came from behind the camera and starts beating me up, and I\u2019m like\u2014well, they pulled him off. And the powers that be said, \u201cOh, my gosh. He\u2019s six months from retirement.\u201d ", "You mean he was yelling at you and\u2014", " Oh, he was hitting me, yes.", "He was actually hitting you? He was actually\u2014", "He didn\u2019t hurt me because people immediately grabbed him, but\u2014", " Here in Washington? ", "Here in Washington at the ABC bureau down there across from the Mayflower Hotel and I was like, \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t do anything. I do not want to be the one that keeps him from his retirement six months from now, for crying out loud.\u201d But to think that that so rankled him what I was saying about women being able to contribute is amazing. I think we also don\u2019t know the history of women. I kept saying to people, \u201cDo you know that there are women soldiers buried\u2014Revolutionary soldiers buried at West Point?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, they cross-dressed and you know what? When they were discovered, Washington insisted they be paid the same because they fought the same.\u201d", " Can I ask you about the response in the political and national security establishment? So a lot of this activism that you were undertaking on behalf of getting women into positions in the military, getting women into positions in our national security establishment. It was occurring in the 1980s and the 1990s when there\u2019s first two Republican presidents and a Democratic president. That power establishment, how resistant were they? How much did women who entered that world find it welcoming or not? People say, \u201cOh, well, there was Jeane Kirkpatrick in the Reagan administration.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine that she was really partnering with you on these issues.", "No. It was fairly lonely. I found that a lot of women in the women\u2019s movement, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the military, their response was, \u201cWhy do you want women in the military anyway? We\u2019re for peace.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m for peace, too, but there are people who want to make this their career and I think they might make it a better military if they were in it.\u201d So we were having a big fight with Bella Abzug", "about it. \u201cWhy do you keep pressing away on this? Why don\u2019t we work over here in this area?\u201d", "But that was a key point, actually. Because I think that probably went on for a long time and it explains why even those women who did enter national security didn\u2019t necessarily have the same infrastructure of support.", "They didn\u2019t. They absolutely didn\u2019t and don\u2019t let anyone tell you they did because I kept trying to get it and you can\u2019t think of a women\u2019s convention where this really came up. It was always like, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll get to it but we\u2019re really not for that.\u201d ", "What about the nexus between sex and sexual harassment and the institutionalized sexism and gender discrimination, right? We all understand there is a connection here. But in some ways, we tend to treat these as separate problems. How much, once you got women into these academies, once you fought to get them into positions, did you immediately then begin hearing from them about incidents of sexual harassment or outright sexual assault? ", " Well, I did from a lot of them and I think one of the interesting things that when the U.N. had that International Year of the Woman, there was a Dr. Elise Boulding who did this very interesting study and I think she was absolutely right. She talked about you can\u2019t really change an institution until you have a critical mass of women. This idea that you put one woman on the board and everything will change. No.", "The tipping point.", "Exactly, you put one woman and everything\u2019s going to\u2014no, no, no. And it\u2019s not like two are going to do it, either. You\u2019ve got to have a critical mass. So clearly, with women going into the military, we\u2019re nowhere near a critical mass nor any of these schools and we\u2019re dealing with the same people who fought violently not to let them in. The second thing is if you go back and look, DOD, they studied women in the military more than any other group that\u2019s ever come into the military and they always did very well. In fact, they did wonderfully well. So they never knew what to do. It was like, \u201cDamn. Well, we\u2019ll study again next year. Maybe it will come out worse next year.\u201d ", "They used to say, \u201cWell, women will get pregnant. They\u2019re going to miss a lot of time and on and on and on.\u201d They found that what often happened was that young men would be involved in motorcycle accidents and so forth and so on and actually, young men were missing more days than young women. So no matter where you looked at it, they couldn\u2019t find a way to get rid of them. ", " That\u2019s a good way of putting it. Do you have any specific memories of any women that you connected with who brought their stories of harassment to you or that you tried to intervene on their behalf?", " Oh, yes. I worked obviously, with the young woman on Tailhook who brought hers. I had then lots of different instances. One of my favorite\u2014Carter, I believe, put in the first woman secretary of the Air Force. And I had an Air Force installation in my district then I came home one weekend and this group of young women came and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all junior officers and we\u2019re supposed to go to the officers club\u201d\u2014because that\u2019s where you get your credentials and you schmooze. \u201cBut they keep having these topless go-go dancers and everything there.\u201d ", "At the officers club?", "At the officers club and it\u2019s really hard. So I said, \u201cOh, my god. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d So I get a hold of my friend who is secretary of the Air Force and she says, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m putting an order out immediately.\u201d So I think I\u2019m probably the smartest person on the planet and I\u2019ve solved this, bam, bam, which you almost never do. About six months later, they come back to the office and they say, \u201cI thought you were going to fix this. What\u2019s happened?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s happened?\u201d I call my friend, the secretary, and she says-- she convenes all of the people around her, all the uniform guys and she said, \u201cWhat happened to that order?\u201d And they said, \u201cOh, we thought you were kidding.\u201d They didn\u2019t send it out. Well, they did then. That was the end of it. ", "But that tells you how entrenched it was in their thinking, that, \u201cOh, she must be kidding. She certainly wouldn\u2019t expect us to take out the topless go-go dancers in the officers club.\u201d Glasser: How did they feel about you in this activism on the Armed Services Committee? ", "Oh, they didn\u2019t like it at all.", "Were there other women on the committee at that time?", "Yeah. The first year I was there, the Republicans put on a woman, Marjorie Holt. ", "And then, later on, several other women came on. Actually, I don\u2019t think we ever had more than three. But no, I think they all thought I was nuts. \u201cWhy are you causing all this trouble?\u201d It was always, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing the important things?\u201d And I would be like, \u201cAnd what are they?\u201d \u201cOh, well, how many carriers we should have.\u201d And I would go, \u201cI think I could do both.\u201d ", "Was there a big change with the Clinton Administration coming in? ", "Well, they certainly appointed a lot more women at the top. That really helped. I think of the bit, if they put out an order, they thought it was kidding. That ended. They believed it. Yeah, I think it really begins to help and you also had a couple of classes from these different academies graduating and moving into the mainstream. The other thing I found that really started to make a difference was some of these admirals and generals and everything, their daughters decided they wanted to go to the Academy or they wanted to be in the military. And I remember one admiral who just fought me tooth and nail about women on ships. \u201cOh, no. You can\u2019t have women on ships. No. It\u2019s a tight quarter. Oh, my God. The sex, it will be awful.\u201d And I kept saying to him, they have coed dorms at places and this all works out. ", "And let me tell you how they have locks on the door. Anyway, so one year, he comes for the presentation at the beginning, and all of a sudden, he\u2019s for women on ships. And I thought, \u201cWell, do I embarrass him in front of everybody and say, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d So afterward, I go in the cloakroom and I said to him, \u201cI think this was a change in your position. Am I correct?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, you got me.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, my daughter went into the DC PD, the Washington Police Department. She\u2019d be so much safer on a ship.\u201d And I got to rethinking all of this, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, is that what it takes?\u201d ", "The ultimate politics is personal, right? Well, I know you have to run but I\u2019m also asking everybody if they have any sort of \u201cMe Too\u201d story of their own to share with all those. In your long career in politics, did anyone ever grab you and kiss you? Did anyone ever\u2014", "Well, of course, I think everybody\u2019s got stories about wonderful Strom Thurmond because he was older and he could get away with it, you know?", "Well, you saw what happened to former President George H.W. Bush, though. To me, that was that Thurmond-like behavior, right? So did you get your butt pinched by Strom Thurmond? ", " I think everybody did. But most of them stayed away because I was fairly clear where I was. I was the dragon lady. They weren\u2019t going to deal with\u2014", "Right, in public? Absolutely.", " But there were some women members who did have trouble with others. ", " Did you feel like they saw you and other women as a support group up on the Hill?", "They thought we should be cheerleaders, in many instances, for what they were. There were some that were very good. You always hate to talk in a big generality, but there were some that didn\u2019t get it and probably still don\u2019t get. And who knows what will happen. Look at this week where Congressman Tim Murphy has to resign because while he\u2019s terribly anti-abortion, he has his mistress get an abortion. I mean, really?

Funny.", "They used to say that in the cloakroom? Amazing. ", " Not all of them, but some. ", "Well, I have to say it\u2019s been a real honor to have a chance to talk with former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, who was a legendary figure when I first came to Washington, when I graduated from college and started working here as a reporter and I think we often lose the context and the history of how long we\u2019ve been talking about things like this.

It\u2019s my great honor to be joined for this part of our conversation in our special episode of The ", " and the ", " podcast with Deborah James, who was the second woman to serve as secretary of the Air Force. Thank you so much for joining us today.", " Thank you, Susan.", "Well, this is really\u2014I\u2019m just overwhelmed by all of the thoughtful reflection and conversation, and national conversation, really, that has been spurred over the last few weeks by these revelations about Harvey Weinstein, about powerful figures in the media. Just the other day, we had the British minister of defense resigning after he was faced with public accusations of harassment, and said he couldn\u2019t be sure there wouldn\u2019t be more coming out. ", "My guess is, on some level, none of this is a surprise to you. You\u2019ve been living with it privately and professionally for a long time, seeing this play out. But the public aspect of it might be a little bit of a stunner. How has this national conversation impacted you? What have you been thinking about?", "Well, on the one hand, it\u2019s a shame that we continue to have episodes like this, and we really have had, as you point out, a rash of episodes, a rash of revelations in recent weeks and months. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not all that much of a surprise to me. I think this issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, it has been with us for a long period of time. It\u2019s been with us forever, and the more that we talk about it, I think the more possibility of this really being a game-changing moment in history, where maybe we can get on a different trajectory.", "But, on the other hand, I\u2019ve been around enough, scandals happen, things get publicized, everyone rushes to the scandal, but eventually, something else overtakes the public discourse, and we forget. And then we have to repeat when another scandal erupts. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen to us again. I hope real change can be forthcoming.", " Well, it\u2019s interesting that you raise that. I think there are so many smart women I\u2019ve spoken with, especially in the national security space, and they\u2019re on the one hand feeling it\u2019s about time to have this national conversation but it is definitely tempered by a concern that we\u2019ve been through not one, but many scandals before without it changing many of the structural issues. And I was struck by how many scandals didn\u2019t turn into a national conversation, including ones that you yourself oversaw disciplinary action in.", "Just a few months ago, you were then at that time still the secretary of the Air Force. There was an Air Force action that you participated in which you stripped a retired four-star general of two ranks and docked him about $60,000 per year in pension payments after determining that he had coerced sex with a subordinate officer three times and told her that he would\u2014quote\u2014deny it until the day he died. I\u2019m reading from a USA Today story.", "You know, I was so impressed, on the one hand with how you handled that. You wrote: \u201cYou are hereby reprimanded!\u201d in exclamation points on December 6, 2016. \u201cYour conduct is disgraceful, and but for the statute of limitations bar to prosecution, would be more appropriately addressed through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\u201d", "But there was no big national outcry around this. Tell us about that case and others that you handled as the secretary, and what it tells you about our overall state of willingness to address sexual misconduct.", " That case, I believe, was one of the most senior uniformed military officers who was ever disciplined. That case was a retired four-star general from the Air Force, as you point out. I think the higher you are in a leadership position, whether you\u2019re in the uniform military, whether you\u2019re in the civilian part of government, whether you\u2019re in business, whatever your industry may be, you\u2019re in a special position of trust. And so, you all the more have to adhere to the rules, have to demonstrate dignity and respect to all.", "So, in this case the victim came forward years after the fact, and indeed, as you pointed out, there had been statute of limitation issues, which essentially made the Uniform Code of Military Justice not workable in this case. And so we went through the whole process. ", "There was a significant investigation. A lot of time and effort went into it. It was fully coordinated. I heard all the viewpoints, including from the accused, as well as from the victim, and at the end of the day I made the decision to hold this person accountable the best way I could with the tools that I still had left in my toolbox.", "Again, the higher you are, the greater position of trust that you are privileged to serve in, and if you misuse that trust there needs to be accountability.", "What do you think, and what did you learn in the course of this case and others that you were privy to as secretary? What did you learn about the culture inside the Pentagon and inside the U.S. military when it comes to questions around abuse of power and sexual coercion? We all know intuitively that there have been scandals inside the uniform military. How does it connect with our broader national security conversation?", " Well, I\u2019m not so sure there are more scandals within the uniform military than there are in many other walks of life in the United States, and indeed, around the world. I\u2019m not necessarily convinced of that, but of course, my life\u2019s work has been focused on the military and national security.", " And women are very underrepresented in senior positions in all of these places.", "Women are underrepresented. If you go way back in my personal career, I started early on, on Capitol Hill for the House Armed Services Committee, and at the time I joined the professional staff, there was only one or two at best other women who were professional staff members. So, I was young and I was one of a very few in that type of a national security job. ", "I went on to the Pentagon, and was an assistant secretary of defense when I was in my thirties. So once again, I was rather young; I was one of a few at that point. This was the \u201890s in the Clinton administration. And then most recently, I returned to government as the secretary of the Air Force.", "This was, of course, an even more senior job. There were more women in the environment, but still, underrepresented. And if you take that to the uniform military side, women have attained the highest ranks on both the enlisted and the officer side, but there are still not that many. It is still an underrepresented, even though we\u2019re 50 percent of the population.", "Well, so, let\u2019s talk about that. Yesterday we had this very frank conversation with some of your peers, or younger women who worked in the national security field, and we got very real; we got very personal. Like you, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ve all spent the last few weeks in a way excavating our own past, as well as looking at the broader policy discussion. ", "And, thinking about those things when we were young and coming up, especially when you were one of only one or two people on, say, the Armed Services Committee staff, what I was blown away by was every single person around the table had incidents that in hindsight, or in today\u2019s climate, would be viewed as harassment, or at the least, a hostile environment\u2014women changing their appearance, or saying, \u201cOh, gee, I can\u2019t wear skirts to the office. I\u2019m afraid of that assistant secretary.\u201d ", "Tell us a little bit about your own experience coming through a profession where there were so few other similarly-situated women. Did you ever feel those, or encounter those kind of incidents?", "When I was in my twenties and thirties, I did encounter some of those types of incidents. My incidents were more when I was on Capitol Hill as a young staffer, and into my early thirties. By the time I reached the Pentagon, I will say I did not encounter those instances, because by the time I reached the Pentagon, I myself was in a position of authority and power, and I was a bit older\u2014though I was still fairly young\u2014for that level of a job. ", "Youth is not always part of the explanation, but with youth usually comes a lack of authority, a lack of power, a lack of experience, and so people who are older, people who do have that authority and power, can fail in their own integrity, and take advantage of that, and they can press, and they can see what the traffic will bear, so to speak.", "And so I have my own stories of that, but they come more from Congress and they come more from my international travels when I was with the Congress. So, it\u2019s not just in the United States, as I said, you will encounter this all over the world. And I think young women\u2014young men, as well\u2014but, youth and a lack of power, it tends to happen more. Not exclusively, but more.", " Yes. We talked about that, that that is one of the things that makes this national security or foreign policy field different than women encounter these problems in every profession, but this is a specificity of our Washington world, which is traveling internationally to places that have even more problems with this. Several of the women recounted being afraid, literally afraid on some of these foreign trips where they\u2019re representing the United States, or the U.S. Congress, and they felt that they were potentially going to be preyed upon, or also felt a problem with members of Congress not wanting to travel with them, that it could affect their careers negatively. Did you ever experience that, this ceiling? I mean, now, people are afraid a little bit that there could be a backlash\u2014right?\u2014and that the response to, \u201cOh my goodness, there\u2019s all these accusations of sexual harassment. I shouldn\u2019t be alone with a woman,\u201d the Mike Pence rule.", " I never feared for my safety, per se, certainly not with any of the U.S. colleagues, be they superiors or peers of mine. I never feared for my safety, but I\u2019ve been in uncomfortable situations which I handled in my own way. What I never did then is what some of the women are now doing today. I never spoke out then. And this is why I say, at a level, or at a point in time where there really is this critical mass of women who are having the courage to come out and speak about these things, we have at least the potential to have this be a game-changing moment. ", "This has been going on for a long time, but to the extent people like me\u2014and I\u2019m complicit in this\u2014the fact that we said nothing, the fact that we dealt with it in our own way\u2014perhaps in retrospect that was wrong of us to do. But, as you point out, particularly when you\u2019re younger you don\u2019t know quite what to do. You just try to get through it. You don\u2019t succumb to it, hopefully, but you just carry forth and you do the best you can and you ignore it. That was the way I approached it, because I didn\u2019t want to be the one to make an accusation and possibly have it blow back on me, which is why this continues to be a very underreported crime and inappropriate types of behavior.", " You know, a couple weeks ago in this whole controversy\u2014I\u2019m sure you remember\u2014with White House chief of staff, General John Kelly, he was talking about the Gold Star families. And he made a point that I think caused a lot of women here in Washington to really do a double-take in the course of that, where he seemed to be bemoaning a past where he said women were \u201csacred.\u201d And a lot of people were surprised by that comment, thinking that the good old days maybe weren\u2019t so good for women.", "But I\u2019m wondering, was that attitude prevalent in the Pentagon at the upper levels? You know, it has historically been a somewhat isolated and insulated male-dominated, warrior culture.", "In the Air Force, in the area that I focused on most recently in government, I didn\u2019t hear talk like this. As a matter of fact, we\u2014during the period that I served\u2014opened up the remaining, that previously had been closed, jobs to women. Now, the Air Force had always been the most open service; it was a little bit more difficult for the Marine Corps, and, of course, Kelly is a Marine retired general. It was a little bit more difficult for the Army. It was probably the easiest for the Air Force to open up those remaining jobs.", "But if you go back in time, in the 1990s, for example, I was in the Pentagon at the time that we collectively opened up combat aircraft to women, and combat naval vessels to women, as well. That was much more I would say gut-wrenching from my memories. So, the leaders of that era, who were at that time four-star generals, were much more of the ilk of, say, my father, the type of thing that my father would say, and my father might have said something like, \u201cWomen are sacred.\u201d My father\u2014God rest his soul\u2014was born in the year 1923. ", "So, this is also a generational thing. And it is my hope that the more that we bring women into these different types of specialties, and particularly if we can reach a critical mass\u2014not just a handful, but a critical mass of women, and men see that they\u2019re doing the job\u2014these attitudes will change. ", "Were there things that you tried to do that you were surprised or frustrated that you couldn\u2019t get done when it came to empowering women more within the military?", " As the secretary of a military service, we are privileged when we are in these jobs to be able to give out promotion instructions to promotion boards. And these are portrayed as your individual instructions. But with that said, there are a lot of parameters. And I had hoped to be able to put more about the importance of diversity and inclusion into those promotion instructions to try to bring up more people of diverse backgrounds and diverse ethnicities, and gender, and so on. I had hoped to put more in those promotion instructions, but found that I was legally constrained and that it was really quite modest, what I was able to do. So that was a bit of a surprise. I thought I would have more leeway than I did.", "What was not surprising\u2014and again, this is what gives me hope for the future\u2014is the senior male leaders in the Air Force of today were very embracing of these initiatives, of the thrust of wanting to work on this more. Because, guess what? We\u2019re all in a war for talent, and if 50 percent of the population of young people that you\u2019re trying to draw from is female, then why wouldn\u2019t you want to get your fair share of that fantastic talent in the front door?", "So, they get that part. That\u2019s the business imperative, I\u2019ll say, for the Air Force. And so, I think it is different today. We have come a long way, but there still is a long way yet to go.", " Well, that\u2019s a good summation of it. One of the things that came up repeatedly in our group conversation was the question of whether women in national security face the added almost public burden of our very image of what a guardian of national security looks like, right? Why does Donald Trump appoint so many generals? He calls them \u201cmy generals.\u201d Because they fit the suit\u2014you know, this notion that we have to have a sort of big, burly, retired three- or four-star general communicating to us about our defense policies and national security.", "How much do you think our notion of guardianship and of national security is still tied up with images of men?", "Probably a great deal. And when you speak about command of troops\u2014I mean, that is very, very still heavily commanded by men. I mean, women who have come up through the ranks and been at the senior-most positions in the military have tended to be more in the acquisition field; they\u2019ve been medical corps; they\u2019ve been things other than combat-oriented command of troops. That\u2019s changing gradually, but very gradually.", "Right. And if you need to be a combat commander in order to then rise up to the very top\u2014right\u2014", "You had to have checked all the boxes along the way for promotions and so on. But one example that we\u2019re all very proud of is General Lori Robinson, who is the first combatant commander. She is the commander of Northern Command, so she\u2019s responsible for the defense of the United States, as well as the entirety of North America. So, she is a combatant commander and she is a first. ", "So, that\u2019s an example of how things have slowly changed for women to be able to command troops. As the secretary of a service, I liken the job to more being the CEO of the enterprise, so it\u2019s a question of budget, it\u2019s talent management. It\u2019s a question of training and investments for technology, and procurement, and so on. But what I always tell women about matters of appearance is, be who you are, play to your own strengths. Don\u2019t try to outdo somebody else who has strengths that you don\u2019t have.", "So, for example, I was never a combat pilot, so I never attempted to outdo the combat pilot on matters of piloting a combat aircraft, if you see what I mean. But I did know a lot about business. I knew a lot about the Congress, budgets, talent management\u2014so you\u2019ve got to play to your strength, and there\u2019s where you need to also have a team of people around you who can complement you where you\u2019re not as strong.", "Looking back 20, 25, 30 years ago, when you were a young staffer starting out on the House Armed Services Committee, what would you tell your 20-something, 30-something self now, when it comes to these issues of gender in the workplace and sexual harassment?", "I would tell my 20-something self in certain ways to do exactly what you did, which is dream big, aspire high, go for it. But I think I would also tell my 20-something-year-old self, speak up more. When you see things that aren\u2019t appropriate or when something happens to you that is not appropriate, speak up. Don\u2019t be fearful; speak up. Take that chance. And I would like to think that I might do that. ", "But again, when I was in my early twenties, I, too, had a certain fear about speaking up, and didn\u2019t want to make waves. And that\u2019s another thing. It\u2019s this bystander complex. So, whether we\u2019re a woman or we\u2019re a man, if we\u2019re in an environment and we see things going south quickly, if we see inappropriate jokes, inappropriate touching, anything of this nature, to the extent we stand by and let it happen, or worse yet, if we giggle along with the joke, that\u2019s real bad. And all of us who care about this issue need to stop doing that to the extent that we have done it. ", "So, it\u2019s not just if it happens to you, but if you are in the environment and you see it happening, take a stand. Say something.", " I\u2019m sure you must have known men who have been accused of things like this, or where this happened firsthand to you, and going back and thinking about that is a very complicated and painful thing, right? You don\u2019t get to go back 20 years in time.", " You don\u2019t get to go back, but again, I will say, in the spectrum of things that could happen to a person, I didn\u2019t have the worst end of the spectrum happen to me. And so, through the years it has not been something that has deeply troubled me, that I\u2019ve had difficulty getting beyond, so to speak. ", "But this is a moment in time when we\u2019re reflecting, because it is so much in the headlines, and there are so many prominent people now who we now know have really engaged in some pretty predatory behavior. So, I think at a moment like this it makes somebody like me\u2014and perhaps like some of the other women you\u2019re speaking with\u2014reflect back to some of the things that happened to us, or that happened to our peers, that we either knew about or should have known about, and how did we react? And how might we recommend to our own daughters, our own sons, other young people in our midst\u2014what would we recommend today? And I know I would recommend speak up.", "Secretary Deborah James, second woman secretary of the Air Force and our guest this week on The ", ". You know, Eleanor Roosevelt was famous for saying that to be a woman in public life, you have to have the skin of a rhinoceros, and I keep thinking of that when it comes to how many women have chosen to tough it out in very male-dominated spaces like national security.

And \u201che\u201d is Donald Trump. Four times over the past year, in Geneva, Pyongyang, Oslo and Moscow, DiMaggio has secretly met with North Koreans to talk about the country\u2019s nuclear program. But what they really want to talk about, DiMaggio said in an extensive new interview for The Global Politico, is America\u2019s volatile president. ", "The North Koreans have asked her not only if Trump is nuts, DiMaggio said, but what and how to think about everything from his public undercutting of his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia.", "\u201cThey really want to know what is his end game,\u201d said DiMaggio, a scholar at New America who specializes in talking with rogue regimes and has spent the past two years in these secret discussions with the North Koreans. She believes they were ready after Trump\u2019s surprise election to discuss a new round of official talks with the U.S. to defuse the standoff over their nuclear weapons\u2014but that Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric and Twitter rants such as his weekend taunting of North Korea\u2019s \u201cshort and fat\u201d Kim Jong Un may have foreclosed that option. \u201cThey follow the news very closely; they watch CNN 24/7; they read his tweets and other things.\u201d", "Among issues the North Koreans have raised with her in recent months, DiMaggio said, were everything from Trump\u2019s tweet urging Tillerson to give up on diplomacy with North Korea (\u201cIs this a good cop/bad cop that he\u2019s doing with Tillerson?\u201d) to Trump\u2019s decision this fall to decertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear deal forged by his predecessor, Barack Obama. That, DiMaggio said, \u201chas sent a clear signal to the North Koreans: Why should they enter a deal with us, if we\u2019re not going to stick with it?\u201d", "\u201cThey question his erratic behavior, and also his mounting problems here at home, with the investigation being conducted by Robert Mueller, and they are asking, \u2018Why should we begin negotiations with the Trump administration, when Donald Trump may not be president much longer?\u2019\u201d", "***", ", a longtime U.S. diplomat turned scholar at Johns Hopkins University who founded the influential North Korea-watching website 38North, have been quietly meeting with North Koreans to talk about the country\u2019s nuclear program. In the past, they hardly acknowledged the conversations, part of a \u201cTrack 2\u201d dialogue that has kept a line open to the isolated dictatorship even when the two governments officially were not on speaking terms.", "But that was before Trump.", "In their meetings with the North Koreans since Trump was elected, DiMaggio and Wit watched their growing alarm and confusion as an initial outreach after the election testing U.S. reaction to new nuclear talks descended into a Trumpian fury of name-calling, mutual recriminations and military escalation. Now she and Wit are speaking out despite their past reluctance even to acknowledge the North Korean meetings, describing them in a recent ", " and adding new detail in this week\u2019s episode of our Global Politico podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t normally talk about my \u2018Track 2\u2019 work in such a public way,\u201d DiMaggio tweeted. \u201cBut these are far from normal times.\u201d", "Their account comes at a fraught moment in the burgeoning crisis with North Korea, with Trump wrapping up a 12-day Asia tour after sending confusing and contradictory signals. The president initially projected an uncharacteristically diplomatic approach on the trip, suggesting a new openness to negotiations as a way out of the nuclear impasse, delivering a strongly worded address in Seoul about North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses, and pressing the Chinese in Beijing to make common cause with the U.S. on stepped-up sanctions against the neighboring North Korean regime.", "But even before a final stop in Manila, Trump was back into a war of words with Kim that seemed to undercut the trip\u2019s scripted statesmanship. While DiMaggio and Wit had no definitive answer for the North Koreans when they had asked if Trump was crazy, the North Koreans clearly came to their own conclusion. Responding to Trump\u2019s Seoul speech, North Korea\u2019s state media called him a \u201clunatic old man\u201d looking to start a nuclear war. It warned that the United States faced an \u201cabyss of doom\u201d unless it gets rid of Trump and abandons his \u201chostile policy.\u201d", "Trump, 71, seemed more miffed at the attack on his age than his sanity. Abandoning the carefully formulated statements of his advisers, he tweeted back his outrage about being called old, while insisting, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had tried to become a \u201cfriend\u201d to Kim and sarcastically claiming that at least he had never called the rotund young dictator \u201cshort and fat.\u201d", "Even before that exchange, DiMaggio and Wit told me Trump\u2019s penchant for insulting the North Koreans and their leader in unusually personal terms violated rule No. 1 of what the U.S. government has learned over the years about interacting with the North Koreans: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t personally insult this man,\u201d as DiMaggio put it.", "In fact, the name-calling repeats an American tactic that has backfired with previous North Korean leaders. \u201cThe idea that the administration has\u2014and particularly President Trump\u2014that escalating threats is going to make the North Koreans be more flexible, is wrong. Escalating threats only make North Koreans more inflexible,\u201d Wit said. \u201cBeing gratuitously tough, \u201c he added later, \u201cis a big mistake, because the North Koreans can be tough as nails themselves, and for them, being weak is like committing suicide.\u201d", "But Trump has once again gone in for tough talk anyway. Will it matter? After all, U.S. presidents have been trying and failing to stop Kim, his father and grandfather for two more than two decades from nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.", "Still, in the interview, DiMaggio and Wit recounted what they believe to be an overlooked willingness on the part of the North Koreans to engage in new negotiations with the incoming Trump administration, an option they now fear may be no longer available. \u201cMy concern is that because of all these contradictory statements and the threats, that the narrow window that is opened, I believe, for conducting talks is gradually closing,\u201d DiMaggio said. ", "In recent weeks, Wit has publicly put the odds of a military conflict at 40 percent, while former CIA Director John Brennan has assessed them at 25 percent amid signs of escalating U.S. military activity that many experts worry could trigger miscalculation or even outright aggression by North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s not the actual military moves,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, who served as the Pentagon\u2019s deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s when they\u2019re put together with this inflated rhetoric. That\u2019s when I start getting worried about the increased potential for misunderstanding\u2014and actual conflict.\u201d", "***", ", according to DiMaggio and Wit.

That really blew the relationship out of the water.\u201d", "Wit agreed that, while it got little attention at the time, the Obama administration had misread Kim when he succeeded his father in 2010, and had failed to pursue new nuclear talks before then that might have kept the North Koreans further away from achieving a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the continental U.S., a breakthrough they are now on the brink of making. Obama\u2019s approach, Wit said, now looks like a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d", "Given how close North Korea is to achieving that breakthrough, North Korea watchers are divided on how seriously to take the North Korean outreach at the start of the Trump administration and many worry that the Trump team, with a weakened Tillerson and depleted, demoralized diplomatic corps (there are no more than two current U.S. officials, Wit said, who have even met North Koreans), might not be able to undertake meaningful nuclear talks anyway. ", "But DiMaggio insisted in the interview that it was a genuine approach.", "\u201cBased on my conversations with them immediately after the inauguration, when I traveled to Pyongyang to meet them, they were very clear that this could be a new beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t have any illusions that things would be easy, but I think they were willing at least to consider the idea of talks with the United States without preconditions at that time.\u201d ", "That same offer, she said, was made to the senior State Department envoy for North Korea, Joseph Yun, in meetings she brokered, and she believes it was still possible a few weeks ago, when she met a senior North Korean diplomat in Moscow. \u201cShe left the door open to talks with the United States,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cShe had some thoughts on what would need to happen in order for that to take place, but it was a narrow opening, and I think that\u2019s the way we should interpret it.\u201d", "Then again, the encounter in Moscow also underscored how close Pyongyang is to achieving the nuclear-power status it has long coveted: arming itself with a nuclear weapon that can directly target the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way to accomplishing that,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cSo, the real question is, will they wait until after they\u2019re able to declare that they\u2019ve achieved that, or demonstrate it to a point where they feel satisfaction that they\u2019ve reached a satisfactory outcome? And will they return to the table at that time?\u201d", "At least in part, the answer may depend on all those questions they\u2019ve been peppering her with about Trump. Is he a reliable negotiator?

GLASSER", "POLITICO", "President Trump has notched at least one big foreign policy success: uniting senators of both parties against him on Capitol Hill.", "Story Continued Below", "That at least is the argument of Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is now working in close partnership with the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Bob Corker, as the retiring Tennessee senator feuds openly with Trump, chides the president\u2019s appointees, and holds hearings to criticize his policies. Call it a rare outpost of bipartisanship in an increasingly polarized moment \u2014 or at least an example of a surprising and unintended side effect of Trump\u2019s disruptive approach to the world.", "\u201cI believe on foreign policy that there is little difference between the Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\u201d Cardin said in an interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs. He ticked off a list of issues on which he said the committee now agrees across party lines\u2014and over which it appears to be more or less in open conflict with the Trump administration. Among them are imposing mandatory new sanctions on Russia, which ultimately passed the Senate 98-2 over the White House\u2019s objections, keeping the Iran nuclear deal in place and pursuing a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff with North Korea.", "It\u2019s a striking list. In more than two decades of observing Capitol Hill, I can\u2019t remember a comparable moment when the generally staid Foreign Relations panel has been so assertive toward the president, especially given that Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party. To do so, you\u2019d probably have to reach all the way back to the Vietnam era, and the skeptical hearings about the war held by the late, legendary Chairman William Fulbright.", "\u201cClearly, Congress has taken on a stronger role. You see that with the sanctions bill we passed with Russia\u2014and, by the way, also with North Korea and Iran\u2014that discretion that is normally given to the president has been taken over by Congress in our role as the policy arm of government,\u201d Cardin told me. \u201cWe have been more prescriptive on the responsibilities of the president on foreign policy, and that\u2019s Congress\u2019 prerogative, and we\u2019ve done that under President Trump. Yes, we are taking a more active role.\u201d", "Corker offered a highly symbolic\u2014or at least seriously trollish\u2014signal of how far he\u2019s willing to take his feud with Trump last week when he held a hearing on the president\u2019s authority to order a nuclear strike\u2014the first time in 40 years that such an issue has been discussed on Capitol Hill. The session was widely\u2014and correctly, Cardin said\u2014interpreted as a senatorial rebuke of the president\u2019s loose and inflammatory rhetoric about the \u201cfire and fury\u201d he might unleash against North Korea. \u201cCongress is looking for a way to assert itself in that regard,\u201d Cardin said.", "Some skepticism is certainly in order here. Congress isn\u2019t about to wrest control of nukes\u2014or any other major levers of international power\u2014away from the commander-in-chief anytime soon. Despite post-Vietnam efforts to rein in the imperial presidency, the executive branch retains nearly all the control over American foreign policy. And many members of Congress are just as happy to punt when it comes to taking responsibility for decisions of war and peace that might prove unpopular with voters, a fact painfully underscored when President Barack Obama decided to seek authorization for a retaliatory strike on Syria after a chemical weapons attack on its own citizens\u2014and members of Congress all but hid under their desks.", "So no one\u2019s suggesting Congress has suddenly grown a spine under Trump.", "But the bipartisan talk of constraining and at times openly contradicting the president is something genuinely different about Trump\u2019s Washington, and it already extends to a wide range of issues on the foreign policy front\u2014a contrast to the fractured politics of such domestic issues as health care and taxes, where consensus is as elusive as the election results would suggest. ", "While those policy debates play out along more predictable Republican vs. Democrat lines, Cardin made the case for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will hang together against Trump on most of the pressing foreign policy issues of the day. He did not spell out exactly which Republicans he believes to be aligned with Democrats on these issues, though the panel does include, in addition to Corker, several other Republicans whose foreign policy views differ from Trump\u2019s, such as his primary rival Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and another outspoken critic in Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who like Corker is not running for reelection.", "\u201cWe believe that the best course for containing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is through diplomacy, and we disagree with the language the president has used, and the fact that he\u2019s made it more difficult for diplomacy to work. We believe that in regard to the Iran nuclear agreement, that we have to enforce the agreement rigorously, but we don\u2019t want the United States unilaterally withdrawing from that agreement,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what most Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee believe, and certainly in regard to Russia,\u201d where Trump\u2019s public \u201cembracing Mr. Putin was the wrong signal,\u201d and triggered the overwhelming Senate vote to overrule him on sanctions.", "Both Cardin and Corker have also been increasingly critical of Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, warning of the department\u2019s plummeting morale, \u201cdecapitation of leadership,\u201d and ill-considered reorganization plans \u2013 foolish own-goals, for Cardin, at a time when the president has publicly undercut his top diplomat and devalued the role of diplomacy in America\u2019 s foreign policy.", "Tillerson \u201chas made several major mistakes,\u201d Cardin told me. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been the advocate for the Department of State he should have been.\u201d When Trump proposed a more than 30 percent cut to the department\u2019s budget, in fact, it was not Tillerson who objected\u2014but Corker, who called it a \u201cnonstarter\u201d and refused even to take it seriously as a basis for negotiations. In our interview, Cardin said he expects the budget that will ultimately pass the Republican-controlled Senate to be a \u201crepudiation\u201d of the Republican president\u2019s State budget.", "A new confrontation could soon be brewing over Russia on the Hill, as the Trump administration faces a January deadline for imposing a first round of additional sanctions. The State Department missed the initial deadline to produce names of entitles to be sanctioned, leading many in Congress to wonder whether this was the Trump team slow-walking a policy to which the president remains opposed. ", "Administration sources have told me it\u2019s not that, but a bureaucratic failure to meet the initial deadline, reflecting the lack of staffing and disorganization that remains persistent inside the State Department under its budget-cutting secretary\u2014another black mark against Tillerson.", "Cardin is not so sure but either way, he said, Congress will remain adamant about pushing Trump to get it done. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very carefully to make sure they, in fact, impose the mandatory sanctions on the due dates,\u201d Cardin said, \u201cbut we do know there is a reluctance on the behalf of the Trump administration.\u201d ", "Unlike some of his Democratic colleagues, Cardin is no newcomer to the ranks of Russia hawks. In fact, you could even say he helped trigger Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to intervene in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.", "A longtime human rights activist who co-chaired the Helsinki Commission, Cardin teamed up with Republican Senator John McCain to pass the Magnitsky Act\u2014over the objections of the Obama administration. Cardin and his staff worked closely on the bill to sanction corrupt Russian government officials with Bill Browder, a Western investor in Russia whose lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was unjustly imprisoned in Moscow after uncovering a massive fraud that implicated government officials, and later died in jail. In retaliation for the Magnitsky sanctions, Putin ordered an end to American adoptions of Russian children.", "And that was precisely the issue about which Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya came to meet with Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign chief in Trump Tower during last year\u2019s campaign\u2014a meeting now part of the investigation into Putin\u2019s election meddling.", "Special counsel Robert Mueller has just issued the first indictments to flow from that investigation, and Cardin said when I asked about the probe that he believes \u201cthere\u2019s lots of dots, and they\u2019re starting to be connected\u201d as far as Russia\u2019s interference and ties to the Trump team.", "But beyond that, he wouldn\u2019t comment about the investigation and whether it could, or should, lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment, as some Democrats are already beginning to say. After all, he noted, the Senate would have to sit in judgment in any trial of the president after an impeachment.

Despite the entreaties of his staff and their views\u2014like Volker\u2019s\u2014that tend to be far more skeptical of the Kremlin strongman, Trump has never fully given up on his hopes of a friendly new era of Russian-American relations. On his recent trip to Asia, he even reignited the controversy over Putin\u2019s 2016 intervention in the U.S. presidential election, suggesting he believed Putin\u2019s denials\u2014over the consistent findings of the U.S. intelligence community. (The White House later clarified, unconvincingly, that Trump hadn\u2019t meant to suggest any such thing.)", "All of which puts Volker right in the unlikely center of the most contentious foreign policy fight of the Trump presidency.", "***", "There\u2019s no question that Volker, 52, is an unusual figure to have joined the Trump administration. His previous job was executive director of the institute started by Senator John McCain, perhaps Trump\u2019s harshest foreign policy critic within his party and a Russia hawk of long standing who has been particularly pointed about Trump\u2019s praise for Putin. And before that, Volker served in a key role working with U.S. allies to counter Russian aggression as ambassador to NATO for President George W. Bush, whose foreign policy Trump spent much of the 2016 campaign bashing as expensive and inept. ", "Still, Volker pointedly did not sign the letter from a vast array of mainstream Republican national security types disavowing Trump during that campaign. A few of those who did sign it tell me they are glad he is on the case and running what appears to be his own version of a Ukraine policy they can live with; their only question is whether he, and the others who share his views within Trump\u2019s administration, actually matter when it comes to making policy.", "Volker also has the questionable distinction of being the only special envoy actually named to the job by Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has come to office vowing to reorganize the department and eliminate dozens of separate special envoy positions like the one he just created for Volker. And in fact, Volker told me he has taken on the post only in a temporary, volunteer capacity, and that it was necessary because of the \u201cparticularly difficult transition\u201d that left the Trump State Department without any political appointee in place to deal with the Russians on Ukraine.", "When we spoke, Volker had just returned the previous week from a face-to-face meeting in Belgrade with a top Putin adviser, Vladislav Surkov. The session was their third, but Volker was blunt about what it accomplished: nothing. The talks, he said, were a \u201cstep back,\u201d with Surkov reverting to Russia\u2019s initial proposal in September to deploy United Nations peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine along the line currently separating Ukrainian government forces and the Russia-backed separatists. Surkov told reporters after the meeting that Volker had presented 29 separate paragraphs to the Russians and that Surkov had agreed with just three of them. ", "Either way, the meeting\u2019s failure speaks not only to the difficulty of making peace in Ukraine but also to the troubled state of the current U.S.-Russian relationship. ", "Just before the latest Ukraine talks, in fact, a new irritant had arisen: the failed effort to get Trump and Putin together during Trump\u2019s recent Asia trip. I had been told that the Russians were angry that Trump and Putin had not held a formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the recent summit meeting of world leaders in Asia and that the Trump White House had stumbled in both directions, first rejecting the idea of a meeting between the two leaders and then, when it was clear the Russians were unhappy about it, proposing at the last minute to add a Trump-Putin session only to have the peeved Russians reject it. In fact, the ill-timed Trump phone call with Putin right before my Volker interview had been in part a U.S. effort to smooth over those Russian concerns.", "In the interview, Volker seemed to agree that could have been part of the reason for why Surkov had seemed so intransigent at their latest session. \u201cOur third meeting, as you said, was a step back,\u201d Volker told me. \u201cThey went back to their original proposal again. I don\u2019t know what the next step after this is. It could be that that happened for completely other reasons having nothing to do with Ukraine, just where we are in our U.S.-Russian relationship. It could have had to do with the lack of a bilateral meeting between President Putin and President Trump.\u201d", "In general, I found Volker hardly puffing up the prospects of a grand peace settlement with Putin. He said he found Surkov a useful interlocutor, in that the Kremlin adviser clearly has the president\u2019s ear and comes in his capacity as a \u201cpolitical operative\u201d talking about a fundamentally political decision, not as some powerless functionary from the Russian Foreign Ministry. And he said there are \u201cglimmers\u201d of hope suggesting Putin might actually be ready to find a way out of the \u201cimpasse\u201d in eastern Ukraine, given that fighting has more or less stalled and Putin faces tough U.S. and European sanctions because of the Ukraine incursion.", "Volker insisted Putin could turn that around by cutting a deal now to end hostilities and bring in outside peacekeepers.", "\u201cBy invading the country and taking part of the territory, they\u2019ve produced a more nationalist, more Western-oriented, more unified Ukraine than ever existed before,\u201d Volker argued. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the opposite of what they wanted to produce, so it gives them a reason to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re not getting out of this what we wanted. It\u2019s costing us a lot to do it, both in a very specific sense of a military operation and civilian administration,\u2019 but it\u2019s also costing in terms of sanctions, their reputation, their relationship with the European Union, their relationship with the United States. So they might have an interest in resolving this.\u201d", "Still, to hear Volker\u2019s account is not exactly to listen to a conflict on the brink of resolution. Not only is Trump\u2019s personal commitment to pushing Putin and forging peace in Ukraine highly suspect, but Putin himself would seem to have little reason to take such action now\u2014especially with his own reelection looming in March 2018, and the conflict with Ukraine inevitably something that needs to be portrayed as a Russian success.", "Then there\u2019s the equally complicated U.S. side of the equation. ", "Volker and others inside the administration are clearly having to sell their mission to Trump too and not just the Russians. Their case to Trump goes something like this: You say you want better relations with Moscow. Well, that\u2019s not possible with the Russians still supporting a shooting war in Ukraine and subject to tough U.S. and European sanctions as a result. \u201cIf we are going to have any improvement in U.S.-Russia relations,\u201d Volker said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to stay where we are. We\u2019d like for this to be more constructive,\u201d and for that to be the case \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to see progress in Ukraine.\u201d", "Volker says Trump gets it. \u201cI know, having heard from the president directly on this, he wants to do this. He wants to make peace; he wants to see this resolved; he wants to see Ukraine get its territory back. It\u2019s crystal clear.\u201d", "The most pressing current issue that could well blow up Volker\u2019s talks\u2014and further erode Trump\u2019s hopes of improved relations with Putin\u2014are weapons sales to Ukraine. After months of internal debates, both the Pentagon and the State Department have reportedly recommended Trump approve a $47 million package of arms, including Javelin anti-tank missiles that Ukraine has heavily lobbied for. But Trump himself has not yet signed off and many Russia watchers believe he remains reluctant to do so; with the Russian presidential election looming and the fate of the Ukraine talks with Surkov still unclear, it\u2019s possible the U.S. may not act on the recommendation anytime soon. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any decision here,\u201d Volker said.", "Several sources have told me Volker has been a strong advocate for the arms sales, and he made clear in our interview that he supports the idea.", "\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything compelling that I can see as to why Ukraine should be a special case, why we wouldn\u2019t do that, especially when they\u2019re actively trying to defend their territory,\u201d Volker said, before walking through \u201cthe arguments that people made in the past\u201d and which \u201cI don\u2019t think hold a lot of water,\u201d from the prospect that sending advanced U.S. arms to the Ukrainians could actually backfire and cause an escalation in the fighting to the idea that it would embolden Ukrainians to keep fighting and refuse to come to the negotiating table. ", "I asked one veteran Russia hand, a former senior State Department official, what to think about those arguments. Volker, the former official said, is on the right side. But Trump\u2014as far as anyone can tell\u2014is not. ", "And what does that do to Volker\u2019s credibility with the Russians he\u2019s supposed to be negotiating with?", "You don\u2019t have to be a veteran Kremlinologist to know the answer to that one.

A year into his tenure, Trump\u2019s foreign policy remains as unpredictable and at times capricious as the man himself. \u201cPredicting Trump,\u201d deadpanned Dennis Ross, a longtime adviser on the region to presidents in both parties, \u201crequires more humility than anticipating developments in the Middle East.\u201d", "Even when it\u2019s clear what his advisers support and how they have counseled him, the president has repeatedly shown willingness to balk at their plans\u2014or to make his own policy declarations by Twitter fiat, as he seems to have done already several times in just the first few days of 2018, on subjects as varied as aid to Pakistan and the Palestinians and nuclear talks with North Korea.", "It hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention as it should amid the national debate over Trump\u2019s fitness for office occasioned by the publication of a scathing new insider book, but the story of Trump\u2019s Iran policy is a great example of how the president\u2019s willingness to flout the counsel of his own team can land him in a foreign policy mess, or exacerbate an existing one.", "Last year, both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis advocated that Trump remain in the Iran nuclear deal and attest to Iranian compliance with its terms. Both pointed out that nothing in the deal stopped Trump from taking tougher action on Iran outside the narrow terms of the arrangement, which is meant to halt the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But in October, Trump overruled them\u2014while leaving his actual policy an ambiguous quagmire. That\u2019s because he \u201cdecertified\u201d the deal and yet did not pull out of it, saying he would try to work with Congress and European allies to force new conditions on Iran.", "But little progress has been made with Congress or European nations, a broader policy review on how to counter Iran across the Middle East has still yet to be rolled out, and in the meantime, Iran has emerged as among the first genuine foreign policy tests of 2018.", "Over the holidays, a wave of protests broke out across the country, marking the most widespread public dissent in the Islamic Republic since the 2009 Green Movement that erupted after presidential elections that spring returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. Now, amid an ongoing crackdown that has seen mass arrests and at least a couple dozen protesters killed, Trump has publicly tweeted support for the dissenters. At the same time, his advisers have been meeting privately to try to figure out how to deal with the protests and the awkward timing problem: This coming Friday\u2019s congressionally mandated deadline for Trump either to once again certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal and waive sanctions, or follow through on his tough rhetoric and move forward with blowing up the deal, painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration with Iran and five other world powers.", "\u201cPrediction: Waivers will be issued, decertification will be made again,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a key outside adviser to the Trump administration on Iran. Like others, he expects a move on Capitol Hill for new legislation revisiting the deal as well as additional sanctions to punish the Iranian government for its latest crackdown, and the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was consulting last week with the White House on what language would look like.", "But Washington in the age of Trump is no longer certain of its judgment, or the predictive instincts that come from watching presidents of both parties up close grapple for decades with the dilemma of Iran. \u201cI saw a senior official just yesterday who still had no idea what Trump would do,\u201d a former top U.S. government adviser on Iran told me.", "\u201cThe real test comes this week,\u201d says Suzanne Maloney, a leading Iran expert who worked on the State Department policy planning staff in the final two years of the Bush administration and for ExxonMobil during Tillerson\u2019s tenure as its CEO. \u201cMy sense is that what\u2019s happening inside Iran plays directly into the narrative that consumes at least those who are advising Trump, which is that one can\u2019t do transactions with an inherently evil entity, and that fundamentally the problem is not about the nuclear program or about Iran\u2019s involvement in Syria or other places in the region. Fundamentally, the problem is the nature of the regime.\u201d", "\u201cAnd so, to the extent that the president hears that view echoed from Iranians on the streets, it may harden his perception and potentially tempt him to take very disruptive action,\u201d Maloney tells me in a new interview for The Global POLITICO, our weekly podcast on world affairs. \u201cI think it would be a big mistake, but that will be something that we\u2019ll have to contend with.\"", "***", "If Trump\u2019s foreign policy is unpredictable, events inside Iran have historically been even harder to predict. The Iranian Revolution in 1979 was so unexpected that the CIA famously concluded in an analysis just days before that the shah\u2019s regime was secure and nowhere near a \u201crevolutionary\u201d state. During the Bush administration, Maloney remembers, she waged a lonely, \u201ctearful\u201d battle to contradict her colleagues and present then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with an analysis predicting Ahmadinejad\u2019s initial presidential victory. Then Ahmadinejad won\u2014and Washington was surprised all over again by the reformist backlash to him that came a few years later.", "So it wasn\u2019t exactly shocking when this latest wave of protests inside Iran also erupted without anticipation, either to the government in Tehran that has seemed slow to respond or to those in Washington charged with making policy. \u201cWe never learn the lesson,\u201d Maloney says. \u201cWe are persistently surprised by developments in Iran.\u201d ", "Perhaps the real surprise is the incredible persistence and bravery with which thousands of Iranians have defied the conventional wisdom in Washington, and elsewhere, that the theocratic rule of the ayatollahs is stable and, four decades in, largely unchallenged. \u201cThe frame that many on both sides of the aisle here in Washington have had for some time is that Iran is fundamentally a stable place, that Iranians prefer evolution to revolution. They want democracy; they want change; but they\u2019re not willing to risk their lives and livelihoods on the streets,\u201d Maloney points out. \u201cThat may, in fact, characterize well the majority of Iranians. But, it certainly doesn\u2019t characterize the thousands who\u2019ve gone to the streets over the course of the past few days. So, humility is something we all have to keep in mind with respect to Iran.\u201d", "Someone who knows all too well about Iranian bravery in the face of repression is Maziar Bahari, the Iranian-born journalist and filmmaker who joined Maloney on this week\u2019s Global POLITICO. Bahari had returned to Tehran to cover the 2009 election and subsequent protests for ", " and the BBC; when protests over alleged vote-rigging broke out, he stayed to cover them\u2014then found himself dragged off to prison, where he was tortured and beaten in a failed effort by government interrogators to get him to confess he was part of a Western plot to instigate the uprising.", "Bahari, who chronicled his ordeal in a best-selling book ", " later made into a film by Jon Stewart, argued in our conversation that the latest demonstrations in Iran\u2014while \u201cthey have puzzled everyone in Iran and outside of Iran\u201d\u2014ought to represent a recognition that the government is much less stable than it might seem, that it will face such protests whenever there is even a bit of space for such demonstrations to occur. \u201cThe regime, the Iranian government, might be able to suppress the protest for a few days, maybe a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years,\u201d he says, \u201cbut because of these protests, unemployment, corruption, the ineffectual Islamic system that has been Iran for the past 40 years\u2014these will not go away. And as a result, people will come to the streets and demonstrate any time there is a measure of space.\u201d", "Though he understands them well by now, he has little patience for the often partisan and parochial political debates that tend to shape Washington\u2019s response to events inside Iran. In D.C., the fight over the last week has been dominated largely by pronouncements from the Trump administration\u2014including by the president himself and a toughly worded op-ed in the Washington Post by Vice President Mike Pence\u2014vowing not to make the mistake Obama did in 2009 and fail to voice strong public support for the protesters. Several former officials who supported Obama in 2009 in that decision have publicly renounced it this week, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as Ross and Maloney, who says it was a mistake to have been \u201cabdicating responsibility.\u201d", "Bahari remembers what it was like on the streets of Tehran when the protesters\u2014unlike today\u2019s group, a largely Westernized, urban elite\u2014realized Obama was not going to stick his neck out for them.", "\u201cWhether we like Mike Pence or not; whether we like Donald Trump or not\u2014they are president and vice president of the United States. And as such, Iranian protesters, Iranian people like to hear from them,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember being in the streets of Tehran in 2009, when millions of people came to the streets and were demonstrating peacefully, and they wanted their votes to be counted. And it was really disappointing for them not to hear from President Obama at that time.\u201d", "Besides, Bahari added, \u201cbeing anti-American is in the DNA of the Iranian government\u201d and they would go on to accuse the United States of fomenting those 2009 protests anyway\u2014which was, after all, what his interrogators were trying to get him to \u201cconfess.\u201d \u201cSo, whether the Americans are quiet or vocal or screaming, it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re going to accuse their opponents of being stooges of Americans and Israelis and the British.\u201d", "As he spoke, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of those protesters who had been arrested over the last week.

General Assembly and referring to the dictator of North Korea as \u201cRocket Man,\u201d or issuing this series of blustery threats, which, frankly, are terrifying, and are raising the risk of a needless war. ", " And so that\u2019s an example, I think, of the kind of erratic behavior that many of us feared once Trump came into office. And I think you\u2019re seeing evidence of that, even though, you know, some of the worst-case scenarios that we imagined have not yet, mercifully, come to pass. I mean, for example, he has not destroyed NATO. He has not launched a trade war with China. He has not lifted sanctions on Russia. In all those cases, in part, because his hands had been tied. And of course, it\u2019s only a year in, so he\u2019s still got time to go.", " But what I think what we\u2019ve seen has been pretty bad, and pretty terrifying, and confirms the case that those of us who were #NeverTrumpers were making prior to the election.", " ", " And I would just add to that that even those cases where he hasn\u2019t, say, you know, taken the United States out of NATO, the damage that\u2019s been done is extremely serious. His refusal to reaffirm in a serious way our commitment to protect our European allies under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which says an attack against one is an attack against all. His continued\u2014", " ", " Which came from him personally. ", " ", " Yes. ", " ", " When I was doing that reporting, and it turned out that his advisors had put the sentence in his speech and he took it out himself. ", " ", " In some ways the most appalling thing of all, that he continues to question the fact of a very serious Russian attack on the core of our political system. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you get more reckless and dangerous than that. And you know, the president\u2019s first obligation is to defend the country. And in this respect, he doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in doing that. ", " ", " Okay. So if you believe that the premise of your letter was right, tactically was it the right thing? It clearly got under Donald Trump\u2019s skin, and he issued a ", " once he became president that no one who signed that letter could participate in the administration. Do you think that we would be better off if more of the signatories were allowed in?", " ", " Just quickly, it also had another unintended consequence that we can see in hindsight, because the criticism of him from the foreign policy community caused him to round up some kind of foreign policy advisers, so he could put together a team to address the concerns that he didn\u2019t have advisers. And who did he get in the team? He wound up with people like Carter Page, George\u2014", " ", " George Papadopoulos.", " ", " \u2014Papadopoulos, and Mike Flynn. And so a lot of the problems that he\u2019s experiencing now are in part because of the shady characters that he signed up to deflect that criticism.", " ", " Yeah. Well, look, just as a matter of fact, it\u2019s not just that they wouldn\u2019t approach the people who signed the letters, they have\u2014and I know of a number of cases personally\u2014they\u2019ve disbarred all kinds of people, you know, for retweeting something that was even mildly critical. But these were people who\u2019d not signed the letter. So I think this is a man who is hypersensitive, has no idea what magnanimity means, and all that. ", " But look, I do think this is a crisis for our country. And at that moment, you know, there are certain times in politics where you have to be politic, and you have to be careful of what you say. Then there are other times where the most important thing to do is to speak the truth as you understand it. And you know, Max and I are both intellectuals. I\u2019m not embarrassed about that. And part of our job is to speak the truth as we understand it. ", " And I think that everybody who signed those letters had that basic feeling. You know, we didn\u2019t expect that Trump would win, but I think all of us realized that there was a serious chance that he might. ", " ", " That\u2019s interesting. I remember running into someone who signed your letter early on, and running into him on an airplane. And he said, \u201cYou know, I still think there\u2019s actually a chance that Trump could win.\u201d This was at a time when people thought he wasn\u2019t going to win. He said, \u201cBut I found it kind of a calming and clarifying moment for me. It\u2019s so fundamental. It\u2019s actually very revealing for me to see who\u2019s not signing this. And so rather than feeling like it\u2019s a divisive thing, I find I\u2019m quite happy to have signed this, and I feel like it\u2019s just one of those moments where you have to pick a team.\u201d", " ", " Honestly and truly, the moment when I decided to do this, we\u2019d had my kids over to the house and my grandchildren. I was looking at my little granddaughter and I was just thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when she comes back home on spring break, you know, 15, 16 years from now, and she says, \u2018Grandpa, I\u2019ve been reading about this crazy period and I guess you were around there. I know you wrote a lot, but what did you do when this was happening?\u2019\u201d And I just thought, \u201cI have to be able to give her a decent answer.\u201d", " ", " Yes. I mean, I was just outraged about Trump from day one, when he rode down that damn escalator at the Trump Tower and started bashing Mexicans. I mean, I could not believe this was a mainstream political candidate in the United States. I was just\u2014like everybody else, I kind of assumed that he was going to be a flash in the pan; that the Republican Party could never possibly nominate him. And once he was nominated, I kind of assumed that he would never be elected. And of course, I was dead wrong about his electoral prospects.", " But I think I was dead right in my judgment that this is somebody who is not fit to hold office, and I think he has shown that pretty much every single day that he has been in office. And I think one of the shocking, if not entirely surprising, things is the extent to which he has not changed one iota. He has not become one degree more presidential in the year since he took office. So needless to say, he has not actually achieved, as he claimed that he would be more presidential than anybody since the great Abraham Lincoln.", " ", " He often compares himself to Abraham Lincoln. Just the other day, I noticed that he said it was he and Abraham Lincoln who\u2019d gotten rid of the most government regulations. I want to keep on this theme of both this decisive moment that you both chose to take action on. What have been the consequences? Both of you were long-time Republicans. I\u2019m curious how much you think that this rift reflects something that was a broader rift in the party, or is it really just a breakup over Trump himself?", " ", " I think there are two rifts, actually. One is within the party. I think George W. Bush is reported to have worried that he might be the last Republican president. And he understood, I think, that there were elements in the party which were really completely at odds with his version of what it is to be a conservative; that there was this populist, nativist element there, which Trump has been effective at tapping. So that\u2019s a rift within the Republican Party.", " Since then, there has been a rift, I think, within\u2014it\u2019s not just the foreign policy establishment, but a certain political establishment more broadly between those who said, \u201cUgh, well, I don\u2019t particularly like him, but we\u2019ve got to get along, and hold your nose. It\u2019s really important to get the tax cut,\u201d or, \u201cOkay, you made your point. Now everybody should go to work for this guy.\u201d Those of us who really just say, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to continue to say what we think he is, and not yield,\u201d and that rift is a much more personal one. ", " I\u2019m sure Max has had the experience. I know I\u2019ve had the experience of people with whom I wouldn\u2019t say were very close friends, but who were friends of a sort, where those relationships are permanently ruptured, I think.", " ", " It\u2019s a disorienting experience to have people that you\u2019ve thought of as your friends and comrades in arms for years, you know, think that you\u2019ve gone off the rails. And at the same time, you think they\u2019ve gone off the rails. I mean, this was the kind of split in American politics we probably have not had since the Vietnam War days. I mean, this is not a normal partisan disagreement. It\u2019s a political realignment. ", " I mean, I spent my entire adult life as a Republican. I worked as an adviser on three Republican presidential campaigns, but now I\u2019m actively rooting for Republicans to lose the congressional elections next year, because the Republicans have shown they are unwilling to uphold their oaths of office. They are unwilling to defend the Constitution against the nonstop threats emanating from Donald J. Trump. And that, to me, trumps, so to speak, anything else, including concerns about tax cuts, or any of these other issues that a lot of Republicans tell themselves are the most important thing in the world.", " ", " So it\u2019s had a personal effect on relationships here in Washington. There\u2019s also the question of what do you make of those who\u2019ve chosen to serve? A lot of people say, \u201cWell, you know, thank God for Jim Mattis and H. R. McMaster because if not for them, who knows? We might already be in that war in North Korea.\u201d Do you think they\u2019re there to save the country, or to enable Trump?", " ", " Well, I\u2019ve written a little bit about this in some things I do in ", ". And I try not to be personally too judgmental of them. I think human beings are complicated, and they do the things they do for mixed motives. And sometimes those motives are not always entirely apparent to themselves. And sometimes the motives change over time. ", " I think in the case of Mattis, McMaster, probably Kelly too, you know, they didn\u2019t volunteer for the jobs they got. They were asked to take them, and I think they took them, in part\u2014in part\u2014understanding who Trump was, and desiring to contain him. My view\u2014and I know all three, those three in particular, quite well. I think Mattis has done not only the best job, but a pretty fine job of maintaining his integrity as a human being and as kind of a loyal servant to the Constitution. I think the others have been more challenged.", " ", " Do you agree with that, Max?", " ", " Yeah. I think it\u2019s much harder when you\u2019re actually in the White House. I mean, again, like Eliot, I know all those guys, and have admired them for years. And I think that Mattis has been masterful in the way that he has kept his distance from the White House, from the craziness emanating from Donald Trump, but he hasn\u2019t alienated Trump in the way that Tillerson, for example, has done, in a way that\u2019s undercut Tillerson\u2019s effectiveness.", " So I think Mattis has done exactly what everybody expected him to do, which is to be a responsible steward over our armed forces. You know, I\u2019m also an admirer, by and large, of what H. R. McMaster and John Kelly have done. But I think it\u2019s much harder for them because they are in much closer proximity to Trump, and he demands much more from those around him, that they have to be constantly obsequious. He expects people to lie on his behalf. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve\u2014you know, nine-tenths of the demands that he makes on them, they\u2019ve probably resisted, and they\u2019ve probably felt compelled to give in, in a few instances. ", " But on the whole, I think that I\u2019m very glad that they are there. I sleep much more soundly at night, for example, knowing that H. R. McMaster\u2019s the national security advisor rather than Mike Flynn.", " ", " I agree with that. But I also think\u2014I\u2019m just saying this as an observer. Again, I don\u2019t pass judgment on them\u2014that you pay a price doing that, and you pay a price in terms of who you are at the end of the process. You know, you have to be careful about analogies. But I do sometimes think about senior civil servants during the Vichy period in France where, you know, there were perfectly principled people. They didn\u2019t want Philippe Petain running what was left of France. But they felt, \u201cWell, if not me, who else, and I can make it better.\u201d But the problem is it does lead you down\u2014it can lead you down a slippery slope\u2014", " ", " Well, that\u2019s right. And that\u2019s, of course, the Washington sort of political mindset anyways, right, is that mixture of careerism, and patriotism, and also conflating your own interests with those of the job. And you\u2019ve written about this. ", " ", " Yeah. I\u2019ve called it \u201clow-grade Shakespeare,\u201d and it is.", " ", " Right. Well, maybe we haven\u2019t built up to high-grade Shakespeare yet. It\u2019s dramatic, but maybe we\u2019re still waiting for something even more dramatic, like the finale.", " ", " Well, Trump doesn\u2019t rise to the level of ", ". You know, he\u2019s just not that deep a character. ", " ", " Well, we\u2019ll see. We don\u2019t know how the play ends yet, do we?", " ", " I mean, I think he\u2019s done quite a bit of damage in the first year, but there\u2019s far more damage he could have done, and there\u2019s far more damage he may still do with his\u2014", " ", " Okay. I want to get into this, this question. You hear this increasingly from people who are defending Trump, or at least trying to defend, say, the McMaster team. You hear this even from them now, right? Increasingly this case of, okay, A, the world isn\u2019t on fire. We haven\u2019t started any new wars. The policy is good. You have this, I think, very awkward and almost unsustainably schizophrenic situation of John Kelly saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t pay attention to the tweets.\u201d They won\u2019t answer questions about Trump himself, and they say, \u201cWell, look at our policy.\u201d ", " And I\u2019m wondering how you both deal with what I see as the increasing cognitive dissonance of a national security team that wants us to believe that their policy is all well and good as long as you don\u2019t count Donald Trump. ", " ", " I think, you know, they\u2019re making the best case they possibly can from their positions. It\u2019s just not very convincing to anybody from the outside because the tweets and pronouncements of Donald Trump matter, in the end, quite a bit because he is the president of the United States. He is the commander in chief. And you know, it\u2019s often at odds with their message of continuity, and stability, and responsible foreign policy because he\u2019s anything but responsible. ", " And I think, you know, it goes beyond\u2014I know we\u2019re supposed to be talking about foreign policy, but I think it goes well beyond foreign policy. You know, for example, the way that he kowtows to dictators and undermines American support for freedom and democracy around the world. But looking at home, I mean, I think, in many ways, the damage he\u2019s doing at home is even worse, where he\u2019s undermining the rule of law. He\u2019s actively obstructing justice. He\u2019s backing\u2014he\u2019s lending the support of the presidency to monsters like Roy Moore. He is exacerbating race relations. He is engaging in the most blatant xenophobia, racism, and general bigotry that we have seen from the White House.", " I mean, all these things, I think, are very corrosive for the future of American democracy. ", " ", " Max, I feel like if I had just given that speech, somebody would say to me, \u201cWell, you\u2019re just hysterical.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had people push back on you, and say, \u201cCome on.\u201d ", " ", " I\u2019m reflecting what I\u2019m seeing. I would have been perfectly happy if I had been proved wrong about what kind of president Donald Trump would be, but unfortunately, a lot of the predictions are coming true.", " ", " I think that\u2019s right. You know, it\u2019s true, they haven\u2019t started World War III yet. That\u2019s a pretty low bar, I have to say, for an American administration. Max made the point earlier, which I quite agree with, is they could get us into a really nasty war that\u2019s not necessary in Korea. They could do something similar in the Persian Gulf. But I also think the word \u201ccorrosive\u201d is right; that a lot of what they\u2019ve done is to kind of rot out a lot of the American\u2014or to begin the process of rotting out the American position in the world with things that are not particularly dramatic.", " But when you talk, as I often do, to leaders in Germany, or France, or Canada, or Australia, I mean, their view of the United States is changing. And they understand that, yes, Trump may have been a bit of an anomaly, but you guys elected him. And that damage is serious. The damage that\u2019s done when he cuddles up to someone like President Duterte in the Philippines, who is a murderer and a thug, these things do really long-term damage. So that\u2019s real.", " I\u2019d also say that if the people in the administration\u2014I served in a couple of administrations. And what happens when you\u2019re in\u2014particularly in the White House -- is you go into the bunker, and you get incredibly defensive, but you also get, I believe, increasingly detached from reality. And you become incapable of seeing the world as people from the outside see it. I\u2019m sure that given the psychic pressures that all these people are under, given the fact that deep down in their hearts they know what an awful guy he is, they really are, at some level, I\u2019m sure, headcases. You know, that they are really ending up with a lot of psychic burdens in addition to kind of a distorted view of the world.", " ", " Max, you made the point that we\u2019re undergoing kind of a political realignment; that it\u2019s not just Trump, but there\u2019 s also Trumpism, and that it\u2019s challenging in many ways some of the basic\u2014what we all probably thought of as settled, established principles of America and its leadership role in the world. Where do you see us coming out of that? I mean, are Republicans going to no longer be the party of free trade? Are they, as a party, going to end support for American engagement in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East?", " ", " Well, those are very good questions. I think Republicans are very confused on those issues, as is Donald Trump himself. I mean, I think that what\u2019s happened in the last year is that the Republican Party has really undermined any moral credibility it might once have had. I mean, remember, this is the party of Lincoln. Now, unfortunately, it\u2019s the party of Donald Trump. I think Republican office holders have permanently sullied themselves by not standing up against Donald Trump\u2019s assaults on the rule of law and basic decency, and in fact, making excuses for him, and doing his bidding, as they\u2019re doing now, for example, by aiding and abetting his attempts to obstruct justice by undermining Robert Mueller and his special counsel investigation.", " I think that, you know, makes it hard for me to imagine that, personally, for example, I\u2019m going to become a Republican again. I mean, maybe things will change dramatically, and maybe, you know, the party will be eradicated in its current form, and reborn under the leadership of Jeff Flake and John Kasich. I think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. If it were to happen, I would have to reassess the Republican Party. But at the moment, I have to say, I feel pretty homeless because I\u2019m not a Republican, but I\u2019m not a Democrat either because I\u2019m still worried about folks like Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, and they don\u2019t really speak for where I am either.

It\u2019s a crisis of political parties. It\u2019s a crisis of elites, which I think we\u2019re seeing. I completely agree with Max. I find it hard to imagine the Republicans reconstituting themselves as a genuinely conservative party. I mean, just look at, say, the tax cuts that they\u2019re about to have. I mean, I vaguely remember when the Republicans were the party of fiscal conservatism, which is what conservatives are supposed to stand for. That\u2019s clearly gone.

So I imagined, \u201cWell, most Republicans couldn\u2019t possibly imagine voting for this guy because they\u2019re real conservatives in this race, like Jeb Bush and others, John Kasich, et cetera, and one of those guys will win.\u201d And of course, that is not what happened.

He may well destroy the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement. He may launch a trade war with China. These are all things that he is clearly itching to do, and he has been restrained from doing in his first year.

And I think, you know, there\u2019s a chance that we will actually launch a preemptive strike on North Korea, but I think the greater chance of war with North Korea is accidental; where we use a very aggressive military posture against them, have military aircraft flying very close to the North Korean border. They panic. They try to shoot down an airplane. Trump decides to respond. He issues tweets saying he\u2019s going to end Kim Jong Un.

Political tides turn, and it\u2019s very important to have that out there for when there is actually a decisive shift, whether it\u2019s within the Republican Party, or if the Republicans get thrown out of Congress in 2018, so the people have something to work with.", " And you know, I don\u2019t think the situation is hopeless.

And he must have said to himself, \u201cWhat is it with these intelligence guys? Are they political?\u201d The current director at the time, John Brennan, during the campaign occasionally would push back on things that Donald Trump had said.", " So, when Trump talked about the Iran nuclear deal being the worst deal in the history of American diplomacy, and he was going to tear it up on the first day\u2014John Brennan came out publicly and said, \u201cThat would be an act of folly.\u201d So, he sees current sitting director pushing back on him.

", " I\u2019m absolutely certain\u2014because I know the person who\u2019s briefing\u2014I mean, I grew up with that person, worked with that person, have a hundred percent confidence that that person is presenting the intelligence in a nonpolitical, nonpartisan, nonpolicy manner. What Mike Pompeo might say, or Dan Coats might say is\u2014no idea. ", " But I believe the views of the intelligence community are getting across. Whether the president is accepting them or not is really hard to say.", " ", " Well, his public statements indicate that he\u2019s not accepting them, at least in certain critical areas.", " ", " On certain cases, yes. Russia, for example.", " ", " Russia. Okay. So, let\u2019s talk about Russia. Dana Priest\u2014a terrific journalist whom you know\u2014just wrote a very critical and very interesting piece in ", "and she said Russia was an intelligence failure, the Russian intervention in our elections. That\u2019s not really the widely accepted narrative, but I thought it was a powerful piece. Do you agree with that?", " ", " So, she had a couple of different themes, right? And I\u2019d say charges, right? One was the intelligence failure. One was you didn\u2019t brief Congress soon enough, right?", " ", " Right.", " ", " On what you did know.", " ", " And then there\u2019s the question of the social media piece, and basically\u2014", " ", " Right. So, let\u2019s deal with just the intelligence failure piece. I think this is a legitimate question to ask. And I look at it from two perspectives. One, in the intelligence business, we think about warning in two ways: strategic warning\u2014Al Qaeda wants to attack us in the United States, right? And tactical warning: they\u2019re going to attack us next week using this method, right? Those are two different kinds of warning. ", " So, I have little doubt that we, the intelligence community, didn\u2019t see from a strategic sense this particular\u2014and I\u2019m talking about social media here, the weaponization of social media\u2014that we did see that coming. Susan, I went back and looked at all of the unclassified versions of the worldwide threat testimony that the DNI and the director of the agency and the director of DIA give every year, and I read all of those.", " I reread all of those. There\u2019s a cyber section in every one, right? And the warnings are about\u2014", " ", " I remember Panetta, right? \u201cThe danger of a cyber Pearl Harbor.\u201d", ": Right. \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d right. Attack on our infrastructure. I didn\u2019t see anywhere in there\u2014and this was criticism of myself, right, because I was deputy director of the CIA until August of 2013\u2014I didn\u2019t see anywhere in those worldwide threat testimonies a warning about the possible use of social media to attack us. So, I think it\u2019s a legitimate question. ", " And on the tactical question, my question is, when\u2014and I don\u2019t know the answer this\u2014my question is, when did the intelligence community see the Russians messing around with social media in the election?", " And my question\u2019s there because you remember the DNI\u2014the Director of National Intelligence\u2014and the Secretary of Homeland Security put out a public statement\u2014", " ", " On October 7.", " ", " Exactly. And it said two things. Right? The Russians used cyber to steal stuff from the Democratic National Committee and from John Podesta\u2014Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager\u2014and gave the embarrassing stuff to WikiLeaks, right? Which then used it against the secretary.", " And then, two, tried to get into voting systems in the states. It didn\u2019t mention anything about the use of social media to spread and amplify fake news. And so, I wonder, did they know about it at that point? Or did they not know about it at that point?", " ", " Well, you know, it\u2019s very interesting you raise this, because I think they didn\u2019t. Because I did a very interesting interview of The Global POLITICO with Jim Clapper, who was the DNI at the time, who was the signatory, or was the issuer of that statement, along with Jeh Johnson\u2014who I also interviewed on The Global POLITICO\u2014I asked Clapper\u2014this was quite recently, this fall\u2014\u201cWhat have you learned that you didn\u2019t know before the election?\u201d What have you learned from the disclosures that are coming out publicly, or in testimony and the like as this Russiagate investigation unfolds?", " That was what he spotlighted for me, in our conversation. Just this fall he said, I learned the extent to which they were active on these platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which was not something I really was aware of. And I thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty amazing. He was the Director of National Intelligence.\u201d", " Morrell: You know what\u2019s interesting is, if that\u2019s true\u2014and it certainly sounds like it is, based on your conversation with Jim, who is a wonderful man and is the best DNI that we\u2019ve ever had, in my view\u2014if that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s a failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11. Right?", " ", " That\u2019s right. And, by the way, another part of Dana\u2019s critique is relevant here, which is the blind spot, or the failure of imagination at a time when we\u2019ve invested literally billions of dollars\u2014you know far better than I do\u2014since 9/11, in our collection capabilities, in actually operationalizing the CIA, turning them into a fighting force; giving them capabilities you could have only dreamed of. ", " Are we too busy, basically, looking at satellite images of tanks when Facebook is the new Fulda Gap?", " ", " Let me say two things. One is, there\u2019s a little bit of a danger in\u2014and I\u2019m correcting myself here a little bit\u2014a little bit of a danger in overemphasizing the failure of imagination, which is an analytic thing. Right?", " ", " Correct.", " ", " So, it\u2019s a useful critique of analysts. But the other important players here are intelligence collectors, right? So, the failure to see this coming, and the failure to take some time before you actually see what\u2019s happening is also a collection failure. It means you haven\u2019t penetrated the right places with the right assets\u2014CIA and NSA are the two big ones here\u2014to tell you exactly what the Russians are doing. So, it\u2019s a couple of important failures there. ", " The other way to answer your question, Susan, is that post-9/11, there was a huge flow of resources to counterterrorism. Not surprising. I mean, we moved hundreds of people internally. The collection resources were focused on counterterrorism. CIA got back into the paramilitary business in a way that it hadn\u2019t been since the Office of Strategic Services days during World War II. ", " All understandable, but with the implication that we moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia. So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost. ", " One of the things I\u2019d like to point out is that\u2014the CIA\u2019s a large place and the total number of employees there is classified, but to put it into perspective for you, in 1991 we had x employees. By 2001\u201410 years later\u2014we had .75x, so a 25 percent decline. When I walked out the door in 2013, even with a significant ramp-up in resources post-9/11, we only had 1.1x. So, essentially the same number of employees in 2013 as we had in 1991, in a world that was much, much more complex, with many, many more issues.", " How do you cover all of that in the way you have to to protect the country? And the answer is, you can\u2019t. Right? You\u2019ve got to make choices. And when you make choices, you leave significant risk on the table. ", " ", " So, do you think that in making choices, we underestimated Russia and its return under Vladimir Putin?", " ", " I think yes. Right? I think in the early Putin days as president, and then certainly when Medvedev was president and Putin was prime minister, Russia was not what it is today. We were interacting with them in a much more normal way\u2014we being the United States and Europe. It was only when Putin came back the second time as president, that the behavior started to turn, and turned significantly back towards what was essentially Russian behavior during the Cold War, which is challenge the United States everywhere you can in the world, and do whatever you can to undermine what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. Do whatever you can to weaken them. ", " They\u2019re being extraordinarily aggressive with regard to that. And that was a change. That wasn\u2019t Vladimir Putin from day one. ", " ", " Well, that\u2019s very interesting you make that argument. My husband and I were stationed in Moscow during Putin\u2019s first term in office, and then back here for the second term of Bush\u2019s presidency on forward. And there\u2019s a real debate, I would say, among Russia hands about that argument that you just made. That\u2019s very interesting to me, because Russia did invade Georgia in 2008, before Putin returned officially to the presidency.", " And I think the Obama White House arguably staked its Russia policy on the view that you are expounding, that somehow Russia was more amenable to us, and then with Putin\u2019s return to power, that it changed in some marked way. ", " I\u2019m not sure that I agree with that, but it\u2019s interesting that you take a definitive position on it.", " ", " I think there\u2019s a debate, but I feel pretty comfortable with the position I\u2019ve taken. I think Georgia was a turning point. I think Georgia was a really important moment, and maybe that should have been the wakeup call, you know, that moment where he was willing to invade a neighbor. ", " ", " And also, what lessons he took or didn\u2019t take from that Western response to that.", " ", " Or lack of Western response to that, right? ", " ", " Yes.", " ", " Absolutely.", " ", " I think so. To me, that\u2019s a very key moment.", " ", " And, the two things we just talked about go in parallel, right? And are reinforcing to each other. So, he takes an aggressive step and he doesn\u2019t get any pushback; he doesn\u2019t get anything to deter him. Right? And that\u2019s been the history of this relationship, in my view, since Georgia. Right? Is, he does something that is damaging to our interests or the interests of our allies, and there\u2019s not a response, and so he keeps going, and he keeps going, and he keeps going. ", " ", " So, this is endlessly interesting to me to talk about Putin, but I want to cast it into the present a little bit more. So, he keeps going; he\u2019s not only invading Ukraine, but much more aggressive in intervening in the elections, for example, of other countries on the periphery of Russia and Eastern and Central Europe, aggressive measures against neighbors in the Baltics, for example, in Estonia.", "00 And so, that\u2019s where you get this argument from many of my Russia-hand friends that, of course, this wasn\u2019t something new, to intervene in the United States, and it\u2019s exactly what he did in Poland, or in other countries. So that\u2019s one bullet point on the question of our intelligence. ", " The other question is, did we do things to kind of unilaterally disarm from an intelligence point of view, on Russia?", " ", " Well, I think Russia was one of the places that suffered from the loss of resources as they flowed to counterterrorism\u2014no doubt in my mind. There were things with regard to Georgia, for example, that I can\u2019t talk about specifically, but things we could not tell the president about what was happening in Georgia at the particular time that they were doing what they were doing because we had turned off systems that used to be turned on, because now they were focused on other parts of the world. Right?", " ", " The eye had turned.", " ", " So, absolutely, that suffered. I think\u2014and there were also things that we were doing as a country that he was misreading\u2014Putin was misreading. So, I talked earlier about the importance of an intelligence officer being able to tell the president, \u201cHere\u2019s the other guy\u2019s view.\u201d Well, what\u2019s Putin\u2019s view of us? Right?", " Putin\u2019s view of us is that we want to undermine him, and that we are actively working to do so. Right? He really believes that. And he points to things that are absolutely true. The State Department pushing for democracy in Russia openly. And then he points to things that aren\u2019t true, like the CIA was behind the street protests in Kiev that led to all the problems in Ukraine. Right? ", " That\u2019s his worldview, is that we are trying to undermine him, and that we want him to go away, right? And so, when you think about it in those terms, what he\u2019s doing against us\u2014right? It\u2019s kind of interesting, right? It doesn\u2019t justify what he\u2019s doing, but it certainly puts it in perspective.", " ", " No, I think that\u2019s a great point to make, and I think it\u2019s so important. So, Russiagate? Or whatever we want to call it. I don\u2019t know if you have a better name for it than that. Based on your intelligence analyst hat, looking at the dots that are out there\u2014how do we construct a narrative around them that makes sense? Is there enough information to construct a narrative? What do you make of the evidence that\u2019s public, recognizing that it\u2019s a very small amount of the evidence, presumably?", " ", " The best place to start is with a caveat, is I have no insight into the FBI investigation or the two investigations being done by the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate. So, this is really me being an analyst, looking at everything that\u2019s available, right?", " The first thing I\u2019d say is that there may be a benign explanation for all of this. What might that be? The benign explanation is that Vladimir Putin, understanding who Donald Trump was as a person, understanding how narcissistic he is, played to Donald Trump by saying he was a great guy\u2014right? Had the potential to be a great leader, et cetera, et cetera. ", " And Trump responded exactly the way Putin wanted him to by reciprocating, right? Great leader, et cetera, et cetera. Right? Maybe what he did in Ukraine and Crimea was all right. Who are we to say? You know, Putin\u2019s killed all these people, but so do we. You know, try to put this in perspective. Right? All of these things that Trump said could have been simply in response to Putin playing him, and playing his personality. ", " You know, when all that happened, of course, the media and the Clinton campaign jumped all over Donald Trump, right?\u2014and said, \u201cBoy, look at what this guy\u2019s saying,\u201d right? \u201cThis is inconsistent with the world in which we live in.\u201d It is possible at that moment, that Steve Bannon and Steve Miller and Sebastian Gorka walked into Trump\u2019s office in Trump Tower and said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re being criticized for what you said about Putin and Russia, but, boss, you\u2019re right. Right? You\u2019re absolutely right, and let us give you the intellectual context in which to think about this. And the intellectual context in which to think about it is, we actually need Russia as a partner, to push back against the two biggest threats that we see.\u201d", " ", " Right. China, yes.", " ", " Bannon, Miller and Gorka. China and Islamic extremism. And, Russia, a white, Christian country, fits\u2014", " ", " Their worldview.", " ", " Their worldview. Right? So, Putin might have played him, and then Bannon gives him an intellectual framework to say, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Keep talking about this.\u201d So, that is the totally benign view.", " Am I open to the possibility that there is a malign view? Absolutely. I don\u2019t discard that. I\u2019ve been criticized by some people on the left for saying I don\u2019t see any evidence here of a crime. I still don\u2019t see any evidence of a crime. It doesn\u2019t mean there is any. I just don\u2019t see it.", " ", " Including evidence of obstruction of justice?", " ", " So, let\u2019s talk about what I think the possibilities are, going forward. So, I would not be surprised if Bob Mueller concludes that the Trump campaign did not violate the law with regard to its interactions with the Russians. I\u2019m really open to that possibility. Why? Because, as you know, ", ", every media outlet that is worth its salt has reporters digging into this, and they haven\u2019t found anything.", " And I think that, had there been something there, they would have found something. And I think Bob Mueller would have found it already and it would have leaked. ", " So, I\u2019m really open to the possibility that there\u2019s no there there on a crime being committed by the campaign and the Russians. Right? That interaction leading to criminal charges.", " The second point I\u2019d make is that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were single individuals who were associated with the campaign who violated the law with respect to their interactions with the Russians on the election. Paul Manafort comes to mind. I think he has little to no integrity. There\u2019s no way you spend that much time with the old Ukrainian government and not bump up against Russian intelligence officers a lot. ", " I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were single individuals who faced criminal charges here with regard to their interactions with the Russians, and Paul Manafort\u2019s a possibility. But that\u2019s different than a conspiracy by the campaign, right? ", " The third thing I\u2019d say is, every FBI investigation that I\u2019ve ever had visibility into or been involved in, the people who they\u2019re looking at actually don\u2019t end up getting charged with the crime they were being investigated for. They get charged with something else. Right? And that something else in this case could be the laundering of Russian organized crime funds. And if that was done by the Trump organization\u2014if that was done knowingly\u2014it\u2019s a criminal violation. ", "If it was done unwittingly, because you didn\u2019t do the due diligence that\u2019s required under U.S. law for where the money is coming from, from overseas\u2014it\u2019s a civil penalty. And the Trump organization gets fined. What the politics of all that is, I have no idea. That\u2019s the third thing I\u2019d say.", " The fourth thing I\u2019d say is, the obstruction of justice issue. In my view, when I read the statute, boy, it looks\u2014you know, it looks like you could make a case. Now, the hard part is intent. Right? You have to intend to violate the statute. You have to intend to obstruct justice. That\u2019s the difficult piece to prove here. ", " You need something on paper, or you need somebody who heard the president say something about what he was trying to do here, or you need him to tell you that. Right? Well, he\u2019s not going to do that. And so, while it looks like it to all of us, that that\u2019s what he was trying to do\u2014you\u2019ve got to get to that intent part, and that\u2019s what\u2019s hard from a criminal perspective.", " ", " So, well, it goes to Donald Trump\u2019s state of mind, which is the other question I would ask you, with your intelligence analyst hat on. If you were the presidential daily briefer for Emmanuel Macron, or Vladimir Putin, for that matter\u2014what would you tell that president about our president?", " ", " What I would say is\u2014you know, I worked for 33 years at CIA. I watched a lot of foreign leaders. There\u2019s a spectrum of narcissism among human beings. Right? ", " ", " Foreign leaders often\u2014leaders have a lot of it.", " ", " Leaders of any country, right? They have a lot of it. Right? They are one or two standard deviations to the right of the mean. President Trump is no different from that, and in fact, he might be three or four standard deviations out. Right?", " So, what I would say is, \u201cPlay to his narcissism. Play to his narcissism.\u201d I think some leaders have done that exceptionally well. I think Prime Minister Abe of Japan has done it. I think Xi Jinping has done it. I think Macron has done it. There are some leaders who simply can\u2019t bring themselves to do it, like Angela Merkel. She just\u2014bless her heart\u2014she can\u2019t bring herself to do it. ", " But, play to his narcissism. Tell him he\u2019s great. Tell him you want to help him. And then leave the details of the policy to your ministers. Right? So, from ministers to U.S. Cabinet officials, leave the details. Don\u2019t talk about details with the president, just\u2014", " ", " Pretend you agree. Well, is it narcissism? Is it something more than that, though? Do you believe there\u2019s some sort of an impairment?", " ", " I don\u2019t know. I think narcissism itself is an impairment. Right? ", " ", " Speaking of\u2014by the way, the mental state of people\u2014there\u2019s been a little bit of a controversy this year about Kim Jong Un and whether the United States government assesses him to be crazy in some way, or a rational actor. And there was an interesting testimony at an open conference by a CIA analyst, who said he is a rational actor.", " ", " Yes. ", " ", " But Donald Trump disagrees. What do you think?", " ", " He is. He is most definitely a rational actor. Within his worldview, right? ", " ", " Right.", " ", " And his worldview is not that different from Putin\u2019s. His worldview is that the United States wants to overthrow him.", " ", " Is out to get him, yeah, which is not wrong.", " ", " No. No, it is wrong. It is wrong. The United States of America doesn\u2019t care whether there\u2019s a North Korea. Right? The United States wants Kim Jong Un to stop his behavior that is threatening to us.

That\u2019s the difference.", " ", " Correct. Correct.", " ", " I do believe it is our policy, actually, to oppose the North Korean regime, not just on nuclear weapons, but\u2014", " ", " But across the board, right. But the most important stuff\u2014", " ", " Fair enough. I just wanted to clarify that we do actually care about the people of North Korea.", " ", " Yes, we do. Yes, we do. But the most important thing here, right\u2014I mean, we care about human rights\u2014the most important thing here is protecting U.S. cities from nuclear attack.", " ", " Yes. We can definitely all agree on that.", " ", " Yes.", " ", " Definitely. Well, I\u2019m glad you clarified that point, though, on Kim Jong Un, because you do see that recur over and over again as an issue. I know we\u2019re running out of time here.", " So, we\u2019ve talked Russia; we\u2019ve talked Russiagate. Are there things that worry you, or that keep you up at night, that you think we are not paying attention to because we\u2019re so obsessed with things like Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, and whether we\u2019re going to have a nuclear war with North Korea, and Russia?", " ", " I\u2019m smiling because\u2014so, when I was deputy director, and I would do public events, or go to college campuses and talk to people and so forth and so on, I would always get asked what\u2019s the one thing that keeps you up at night? Right? And I felt when I was in the job of deputy or acting director that I needed to answer it with a national security answer. So my answer was always terrorists with nuclear weapons. Right? That\u2019s what keeps me up at night. And it still does. I still worry about that. Both Al Qaeda and Isis and other groups have said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to get our hands on weapons of mass destruction, and we would use them.\u201d", " But the thing, Susan, that really keeps me up at night is that, at the end of the day the most important determinant of a country\u2019s national security is the health of its economy and its society.

So, the thing that really keeps me up at night is the dysfunction in Washington that makes it impossible for people to come together and to compromise and make decisions that move our economy and our society forward.

And that\u2019s the other thing we\u2019ve learned that we didn\u2019t know a year ago. Which was that, Trump placed great faith, on one hand, in all these big, brawny, military officers, current and former, but on the other hand, we\u2019ve learned in a year that he\u2019s willing to disregard their professional advice.

It turned out to be White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon, not yet banished from Trump\u2019s inner circle, had a surprising story to tell the wonky scholar of American foreign policy: Mead, he said, was the reason President Andrew Jackson\u2019s portrait now occupied a controversial place of honor in Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office.", "Story Continued Below", "Bannon had seized on Mead\u2019s work as part of his war on the other factions inside Trump\u2019s White House, and especially the hyperentitled family members like son-in-law Jared Kushner and \u201cglobalists\u201d like national security adviser H.R. McMaster he viewed as selling out Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision to the more conventional course preferred by the Washington establishment. In the rumpled Mead and his writings about the \u201cJacksonian\u201d tradition in American foreign policy, Bannon saw a populist kindred spirit\u2014and a suitably rabble-rousing model for the anti-establishment course he hoped Trump would follow.", "Trump agreed, which is why the Jackson portrait went up and the president was visiting Old Hickory\u2019s Tennessee home within weeks of his inauguration, never mind the instant outcry that greeted Trump\u2019s embrace of a slave-holding, Native American-fighting early 19th century predecessor as his role model. \u201cThat\u2019s what Steve Bannon told me,\u201d Mead recalled in a new interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs. \u201cThere was this Jacksonian moment.\u201d", "Even now, exactly a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead says that while Bannon has been purged from the White House, Bannonism\u2014and by extension the bowdlerized, 21st century version of Jacksonianism he was peddling\u2014has not. If you want to understand Trump\u2019s otherwise incomprehensible presidency, Mead argues, you need to understand America\u2019s seventh president.", "\u201cThe Steve Bannon side of the Trump presidency remains very Jacksonian. Bannon isn\u2019t in the White House, and he\u2019s not welcome I think, but his influence is still felt,\u201d Mead says. \u201cTrump\u2019s base remains Jacksonian. And Trump knows how to play to this base. So even as Trump has kind of adjusted in some ways to the necessities of the Washington establishment and, you know, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t just completely reinvent American foreign policy,\u2019 he continues to orient in this way.\u201d", "After all, Mead notes, Bannon may be gone, but as for the president, \u201cHe still has a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in the Oval Office.\u201d", "***", " it wasn\u2019t just Steve Bannon who took a newfound interest in Andrew Jackson\u2014and Walter Russell Mead. Suddenly, old copies of Mead\u2019s 2001 book, ", ", were being pulled off shelves by those who hoped to understand Trump, and Mead\u2019s essays in places like ", " and ", " and columns in the ", " were soon required reading among those Republicans, like the young hard-liner Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who sought to advise Trump and harness his message of economic nationalism and deep skepticism of immigrants and internationalists. (\u201cInsights that have stood the test of time,\u201d Cotton said of Mead, recommending his book to listeners of The Global Politico last fall; the two have become so close that Mead attended Cotton\u2019s 40th birthday party last spring.)", "For Washington\u2019s political class, Mead provided an answer to explain the otherwise perplexing populist appeal of the brash billionaire. Jacksonianism, as Mead viewed it, was exactly the historical precedent to explain Trump, marrying grass-roots disdain for elites, deep suspicion of overseas entanglements\u2014and obsession with America power and sovereignty. \u201cHe is not the second coming of Andrew Jackson,\u201d Mead said when we talked on the eve of Trump\u2019s first anniversary in office this weekend. \u201cBut there was such a hunger in America for a Jacksonian figure that people were willing to project a lot of qualities onto this sort of very unlikely Queens real estate developer who becomes the folk hero of Americans who hate New York and are suspicious of Big Business.\u201d", "In explaining the historical antecedents for Trump\u2019s hostility toward free trade, establishment-bashing and embrace of a certain kind of chauvinist nationalism, Mead offered an intellectual framework to understand Trump at a time when others remained simply mystified by the president. Indeed, Mead found Trump\u2019s antagonism toward the fundamentals of the post-Cold War international order; rejection of alliances and allies; and visceral disregard for international institutions and the robust free trade made possible by it all perfectly consistent with the attributes of Jacksonianism he had first described more than a decade earlier.", "For \u201ca scholar of foreign policy,\u201d says Mead, who is today a distinguished fellow at the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute, watching Trump\u2019s rise was sort of an out-of-body experience, a once-in-a-career moment \u201cwhere these abstract typologies that you write about suddenly seems to be happening in front of you.\u201d", "Jackson is one of four American historical figures Mead sees as archetypes of American foreign policy\u2014but, like Trump today, he has historically been far from the mainstream. Ever since World War II, Mead argues, politicians coming from the more idealistic, democracy-promoting, free-trade-worshiping ranks of Wilsonians and Hamiltonians have reigned over Washington. Jacksonians and more libertarian-minded Jeffersonian realists have largely been relegated to the sidelines, or reluctantly enlisted in foreign adventures when they seemed justified by the bigger ideological struggle against communism in the Cold War.", "But with the Cold War over, that liberal internationalist approach finally flopped with the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Mead argues, giving Trump the political opening he seized. Bush and his neocons \u201chad little to no real success,\u201d Mead says, with their Wilsonian project of using American power to build a more democratic Middle East. Obama, while more cautious about democracy-building, got sucked in too, leaving \u201cwreckage\u201d abroad and dismayed voters at home. \u201cThe gap between the establishment predictions about where the world would go and then the reality of where the world is opened a gap that enabled Trump basically to run as the little boy saying the emperor has no clothes,\u201d Mead says.", "The problem, however, is that Trump was hardly prepared to govern\u2014which has largely been the story of his first year in office. \u201cHe ran essentially on a negative agenda, that the establishment didn\u2019t know what it was doing. And his proposals tended to be pretty vague and often contradictory,\u201d Mead says. \u201cSo, yeah, now he has the difficulty of, you know, \u2018How do you govern?\u2019 This is always the problem for populism: Once you\u2019re in office, what do you do?\u201d", "Trump\u2019s embrace of Jackson as a governing philosophy has been decidedly controversial. To critics, it\u2019s barely veiled racism, a signaling to Trump\u2019s overwhelmingly white political base that is hardly subtle considering Jackson\u2019s rapidly declining historical reputation. A slave owner and general once celebrated as the conquering hero of the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson is perhaps better known today as a fighter against Native Americans whose tactics were so brutal that the Obama administration announced in 2016 it was booting him from the $20 bill. When Trump recently hosted Native American leaders in the Oval Office and pictures circulated of them standing with the Jackson portrait in the background, Twitter was filled with commentary about the president\u2019s boorish slight of his guests.", "In our interview, Mead acknowledges the \u201cxenophobic\u201d side of Jacksonian populism and says that it has often been a \u201cwhites-only\u201d political movement, but he argues most mainstream scholars\u2014and politicians\u2014have made a mistake by seeking to condemn this key segment of the electorate rather than trying to understand it. \u201cAmerica wouldn\u2019t be a democracy without Jacksonian populism,\u201d Mead says, arguing that it is Jacksonians who tend to fight and win America\u2019s wars, regardless of how enthusiastic they are about starting them. \u201cIn its more negative moments, you can call it xenophobic. And yet somehow the health of our democracy historically has rested in many ways on exactly this sometimes quite problematic strain in American politics.\u201d", "Even now, a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead argues that many establishment types remain confounded by Trump and his erratic approach to foreign policy because they continue to ignore the political imperatives demanded by his Jacksonian base. For example, Mead argues that Trump\u2019s tough talk about the world and penchant for appointing top advisers from the ranks of former generals doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he will end up as a more militaristic president than others, but should be seen as effective political appeals to a base that respects the military more than other American institutions and sees the outside world as a source of threat and fear rather than opportunity.", "\u201cAndrew Jackson\u2019s actual foreign policy was a lot less inflammatory than his rhetoric. And I think Trump, for one thing, understands that Jacksonians like for America to sound tough. They don\u2019t like long, grinding wars, inconclusive wars. And, in fact, they would rather not fight wars unless America is attacked,\u201d Mead explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s logical in a way and it builds to his base for Trump to take a tough line, but he\u2019s been rather cautious about where does he actually commit troops and how much war is he willing to get into.\u201d", "Then again, Mead acknowledges, Trump\u2019s approach to the world really has been confusing during his first year in office\u2014at least in part because many of the president\u2019s top advisers, like McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Defense Secretary James Mattis, don\u2019t seem to share it. There may be a Jacksonian in the Oval Office, but he\u2019s often outnumbered when he gets to the Situation Room.", "\u201cTrump\u2019s foreign policy team,\u201d Mead concedes, \u201cis not very Trumpian.\u201d", "***", " is Walter Russell Mead.", "When Bannon called Mead late one night last summer, he seemed to think he had gotten an intellectual fellow traveler on the phone as he credited Mead with the White House\u2019s Jackson infatuation and that portrait on the Oval Office wall.", "Eventually, Mead decided to disabuse him of that notion. The historian may be an essential guide to understanding Trump as his bizarre brand of politics continues to confound and confuse much of the rest of the world. But he\u2019s not a Trump supporter.", "As he told Bannon, \u201cWell, you know, Steve, I write about Jacksonianism. That doesn\u2019t mean I ", " a Jacksonian,\u201d Mead remembers telling the Trump strategist.

On the other was Samantha Power, Obama\u2019s activist, human rights-minded ambassador to the United Nations, concluding eight years in the White House and in Turtle Bay", "of often futile pushing for more action to take on the planet\u2019s most intractable challenges.", "It was a \u201chuge fight,\u201d Rhodes recounts, \u201ca long debate about how bad this moment is.\u201d", "Rhodes and Obama wanted an upbeat speech. Power, however, wanted to sound the alarm about a world in crisis.", "\u201cOur perspectives are just fundamentally different,\u201d Power argues, a blunt acknowledgement of the gulf that separated Obama\u2019s team on some basic questions by the end. \u201cMy world is a world where we have 65 million displaced, Yemen and Syria and Iraq, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Burundi, South Sudan, Darfur, Afghanistan of course, Venezuela imploding. ... There are concerns about terrorism, there is a fear of the other, and all the trends on democracy, right now at least, are going in the wrong direction.\u201d", "Obama recognized the many afflictions still plaguing parts of the world that his successor would later dismissively call \u201cshithole countries.\u201d But to Obama, the world he would be leaving to his successor was, on the whole, more peaceful and less violent than it had ever been, and Power\u2019s objections notwithstanding, that is exactly the speech he gave the day after their argument. \u201cThe president is saying \u2018Right now, for all these problems, this is actually the best time to be alive in human history,\u2019\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cI think she felt as if that was potentially discordant with the mood.\u201d", "The fight in September 2016 is disclosed for the first time in a new documentary on the Obama foreign policy team that is being released this week, and it reveals an administration that by its final days was deeply conflicted on how to address persistent challenges like the ongoing Syrian civil war and found itself profoundly shocked and unprepared for the upset victory of Donald Trump just a few weeks later. The HBO film, \u201cThe Final Year,\u201d by documentarian Greg Barker, stars Rhodes and Power, who represented two opposing poles inside the Obama administration over the uses and limits of American power to shape events around the world\u2014a running battle between idealism and pragmatism that is, in the end, subsumed by their shared horror and dismay over Trump\u2019s election. ", "In Barker\u2019s telling, Trump\u2019s coming victory in the latter half of the film has something of a horror movie quality, as the blustery New York billionaire makes a few cameo appearances throughout a year of remarkable backstage access to the president and his top advisers, usually when Rhodes is dismissing any chance that Trump will win. The film\u2019s denouement, of course, is that election\u2014captured in a memorable scene at Power\u2019s New York apartment when she throws a party for all 37 female ambassadors to the U.N. as well as feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to celebrate what they all expected to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s inevitable victory. Instead, the night ended in tears, with Power\u2019s sleeping 4-year-old daughter sprawled across her lap \u201clike a pale, Irish statue.\u201d Recalling the party more than a year later, Power ruefully tells me, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of bad ideas in my life, though none as immortalized as that one.\u201d", "The normally voluble Rhodes, meanwhile, left literally speechless by the outcome, is shown sitting alone outside in the night as he repeatedly tries to come up with something to say to the camera that had followed him all year, and failing, for once, to find the right words\u2014or any words at all. When I asked him about it, he said that at the time it felt like he could offer nothing other than a \u201clame rationalization\u201d for why Trump had won. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said when we talked, \u201cthings are just terrible.\u201d", "That surprise ending to 2016 is really the starting point to the debate we\u2019re still having more than a year later: How do we evaluate Obama\u2019s legacy in the world when he appears to have been so politically repudiated at home, and the ultimate fate of so many of his signature diplomatic achievements, from the Iran nuclear deal to the Paris climate accord and Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, is now cast into doubt? Did Obama\u2019s missteps\u2014or even the failure of Obama and his aides to understand the rise of Trump\u2014somehow pave the way for a successor who has little in the way of fixed foreign policy principles except to emphasize how different they are from Obama\u2019s?", "After a year in office, in fact, perhaps the most reliable guide to Trump\u2019s unpredictable presidency may well be his oft-stated preference for doing exactly what Obama would not or could not on foreign policy. Consistent with his campaign rhetoric, Trump has withdrawn from the TPP and the Paris agreement and, just last week, once again refused to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, giving Congress and U.S. allies in Europe a deadline of May to revise its terms or he will abandon it altogether. Whenever he talks publicly, Trump seems to delight in Obama-bashing, and his foreign policy speeches are replete with references to the terrible hand he was dealt by Obama and the many mistakes of the predecessor he has said will go down in history as \u201cthe worst president ever.\u201d", "Given all that, it\u2019s fascinating and more than a bit awkward to listen to Power and Rhodes, in a joint interview for the new Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs, try to come to terms with the explosive consequences of Trump\u2019s presidency on all they spent eight years working for. Both are scathing when it comes to Trump\u2019s turn away from specific Obama priorities like the TPP, the Iran deal and the opening with Cuba that Rhodes personally negotiated, as well as what they see as his administration\u2019s broader attack on the international institutions, promotion of democratic values and Western alliances that have been at the heart of both parties\u2019 foreign policies since the end of the Cold War.", "\u201cWhat Trump has done is in some ways not surprising. He\u2019s partially rolled back Cuba, he\u2019s pulled out of Paris, he\u2019s threatened to kill the Iran deal but not done it. But what\u2019s been worse to watch, I think, is underneath that, the hollowing out of the State Department, the defunding of all the types of programs that Samantha and I fought to get money for \u2026 the kind of unseen elements of American foreign policy that underpin the liberal international order, that\u2019s where the year has been much worse than I imagined,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cI anticipated him taking aim at some of our legacy accomplishments, but it\u2019s more this disavowal of an entire approach to the world.\u201d", "For her part, Power sees Trump as the antithesis of Obama when it comes to foreign policy: \u201cholding our allies in contempt, ripping up international treaties, showing our word means nothing, and then demanding that people do what we say.\u201d She says Trump is \u201cjust draining money from the bank, with needless insults and gratuitous steps away from things that really seem derived more from a formula of how can we do the opposite of what Barack Obama did, than even a considered, coherent approach.\u201d", "She also has a few tough words for Trump\u2019s embattled secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. \u201cCan anybody articulate what our current secretary of state is trying to achieve in the world, beyond the number of jobs he\u2019s trying to cut at the State Department?\u201d Power told me. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d", "It is hard to disagree with any of this criticism, and yet I came away thinking they had still not fully come to terms with Trump\u2019s win\u2014and what their own \u201ccomplacency,\u201d as Power put it at one point, might have had to do with it.", "Rhodes had memorably spent much of the Obama presidency casting himself and the president he served in the role of scourge of the Washington foreign policy establishment, blaming them for decades of pointless, unsuccessful interventions in the Middle East, including, but not limited to, the Bush administration\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq. In a long New York Times Magazine ", " of him released in 2016, Rhodes dismissively called them \u201cThe Blob,\u201d and cast the Obama foreign policy challenge as one of repudiating their conventional wisdoms. But of course, Obama started out castigating Washington for many of the same policy failures that Trump would eventually blame on him, and the film ends with Obama acknowledging in a speech to veterans that he is the first U.S. president ever to serve two full terms in office with the country at war.", "So did The Blob look any better to Rhodes now, I asked, with Trump seeking to blow up both parties\u2019 settled beliefs about foreign policy? Perhaps he and Obama were closer than they thought to the Washington mainstream. And besides, I noted, many of the hawkish, national security-minded Republicans whom Rhodes once disdained have formed the core of the #NeverTrump resistance from within the president's own party. ", "Sure, he allows, \u201cThe Blob and I have more in common than some people might think\u201d\u2014even if he sticks to his view of the Iraq war as a foreign policy disaster that flowed from a Washington whose default setting is to advocate military intervention in response to foreign policy challenges. At least, as he put it to me, both the hawks of the George W. Bush administration and the doves of the Obama administration \u201cwere all for the liberal international order.\u201d ", "***", "If Trump\u2019s looming victory\u2014and the obliviousness of the protagonists to this impending catastrophe\u2014is the haunting theme of the film, Syria is its agonized subplot.", "Power made her name as a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of an account of the Balkans genocide, \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d and she describes herself as tormented and sleepless over the Obama administration\u2019s failure to stop the fighting in Syria. She fought and lost numerous battles inside the Obama White House over Syria, pushing efforts to arm Syrian rebels from early on and for more explicit U.S. military intervention\u2014steps Obama resisted throughout. Instead, Secretary of State John Kerry, a Power ally in the internal disputes, is shown in the film fruitlessly meeting over and over again with the Russians, the outside power that did choose to intervene, in a pointless effort to negotiate a peace in Syria before time runs out on the Obama administration.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no issue that we\u2019ve worked on where there\u2019s such a divergence,\u201d Power says at one point in the film. \u201cCertainly what is happening in Syria is beyond frustrating. There\u2019s no issue where my thoughts and ideas have made such a marginal impact on desperate people.\u201d", "Here her split with Obama and Rhodes was an enduring one. Rhodes had started out as an advocate of doing more in Syria as well, but by the end says he adopted Obama\u2019s view that the U.S. could do little to influence the outcome of a conflict that, while tragic, was ultimately not in the American national interest to try to resolve by force of arms. Not only that, but Rhodes said in our interview he thought Obama had even made a mistake by this standard in continuing the ongoing war in Afghanistan\u2014a conflict that is now in its 17th year to which President Trump has recently decided to send still more troops in essentially an open-ended commitment.", "\u201cI have to apply that lesson to everything,\u201d Rhodes told me, \u201cand I feel like there are diminishing returns about what we are accomplishing in Afghanistan.\u201d", "It can be hard even to have such a second-guessing conversation for the two Democrats amid the bigger disruptions of the Trump presidency.

On everything from foreign aid and military funding to how to undermine Obamacare, Republicans are just as likely to clash with each other as with President Barack Obama.

", " ( ", ") ", " Our survey looks at the 16 legislative committees, identifying the likely chairmen and interviewing many of them and their top aides. The story that emerges is one of ideological divide and tactical debate, with an inherent tension in the committees \u2014 between the gavel holders and the 2016 stars \u2014 making hearing rooms worth watching as Republicans try to prove they aren\u2019t just a party of no. ", " Younger conservatives hope to pass bold conservative blueprints on core issues like health care and taxes, even if they\u2019re doomed to face a presidential veto. Committee chairmen believe that governing requires sometimes putting the possible ahead of the ideal.

He\u2019ll have McCain on his tail \u2014 because the new Armed Services chairman is sure to keep warning that Paul\u2019s ideas would weaken America\u2019s position of leadership in the world.

A lot of conservative activists will side with Cruz, and committee chairmen like Hatch could find themselves in trouble if they don\u2019t sign on to an agenda of repealing the entire health care law through the budget reconciliation process, rather than just the most unpopular parts \u2014 a strategy that would guarantee a veto from Obama. ", " That prospect has GOP strategists worried about the implications for the party, since a closely divided Senate would give a lot of power to a single senator \u2014 like Cruz \u2014 to hold things up if they don\u2019t get their way. ", " \u201cThe tension is going to be, do they want to reach agreements \u2014 and does President Obama want to reach agreements \u2014 and if the answer is yes, are they able to do that, or does a presidential candidate who\u2019s running to the right stop any agreements from taking place?\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who has also served as a top Senate GOP aide. ", " Still, some GOP strategists hope to find a third option between compromising with Democrats on divisive issues and imposing a hard-right agenda: finding issues on which the Republican base is comfortable \u2014 such as promoting international trade, approving the Keystone XL pipeline and repealing the medical-device tax \u2014 and trying to peel off enough Democratic support to make them law. \u201cI think the hope is that things move forward,\u201d said the veteran Republican pollster David Winston. \u201cFor a whole lot of reasons, there\u2019s going to be a focus on jobs and the economy, and then after that there will be an assessment of what\u2019s achievable and what\u2019s not.\u201d ", " Getty ", "\n  ", " ", " Then again, the ranks of the new committee chairmen will include enough hard-line conservatives to ensure regular clashes with the White House.

", "Story Continued Below", " But many demands from poorer countries got little attention at the talks, including their proposal that nations like the U.S. chart a clearer pathway toward steering billions of dollars to help developing nations cope with rising seas, increasing temperatures and worsening storms. ", " In the end, the two weeks of negotiations exposed the huge gaps between what President Barack Obama can achieve at home \u2014 where a Republican majority hostile to his climate agenda will soon control Congress \u2014 and what much of the rest of the world is demanding, let alone what scientists say the planet needs. ", " Hampered by a Congress that has zero interest in tackling climate change, Obama is wielding his executive authority to cut greenhouse gas pollution, including through Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal that gave Republicans endless fodder for attack ads in the midterm elections. Those regulations, along with any future executive actions, would form the centerpiece of the U.S. carbon-cutting plan required under the Lima accord. ", " Obama\u2019s domestic climate agenda has won praise in international circles, including from groups that traditionally lambasted the U.S. for having little to show at global climate discussions. Still, some greens complained that rich countries generally still aren\u2019t doing enough, and representatives from developing countries nearly torpedoed the Lima deal over their frustrations.

It\u2019s clearly showing a commitment to this issue,\u201d said Heather Coleman, climate change policy manager at Oxfam America. \u201cThere is just extreme frustration that the U.S. has dug in its heels on issues that are critically important to developing countries.\u201d ", " The Paris talks are supposed to end next year with a final accord for all nations to cut their greenhouse gas pollution in the years after 2020. At Lima, the countries agreed to offer their individual carbon-cutting plans by the first quarter of 2015 if they can, and those plans will be cobbled together to form the basis of the Paris deal.

Obama pledged $3 billion last month to that effort, but Republican lawmakers are deeply skeptical.

But while the final text called for much of that information, it was ultimately watered down with help from China. Rather than requiring that countries provide that information, the text merely says countries \u201cmay\u201d include it. ", " The final text also dropped language pushed by developed countries that would have allowed nations to review each others\u2019 climate plans at U.N.-run meetings. Several developing countries objected to the language because they are wary of aggressive international oversight. ", " Meanwhile, poor countries urged the U.S. and nations in Europe to consider strengthening the targets they\u2019ve already announced for cutting greenhouse gases before and after 2020. But the U.S. balked, insisting that its targets are ambitious enough. ", " Developing countries also argued that the Lima agreement should require wealthy countries to broaden the scope of their carbon-reduction plans by including measures detailing their financial commitments to helping poor countries and their efforts to assist nations in adapting to the effects of climate change. Instead, the final text \u201cinvites\u201d countries to consider including adaptation measures in their plans. ", " And poor countries want their wealthier counterparts to set a clear path toward providing $100 billion a year in public and private money for climate aid by 2020. The Lima text falls short of that, though it \u201curges\u201d countries to \u201cprovide and mobilize enhanced financial support.\u201d ", " Finance was a major sticking point in the talks.

It included language taken directly from last month\u2019s climate announcement between Obama and Xi, saying next year\u2019s Paris agreement should broadly reflect the \u201cprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.\u201d ", " That reflects both the U.S. stance that every nation has a part to play in preventing catastrophic climate change and China\u2019s insistence that richer nations that have prospered from burning fossil fuels for decades have a different responsibility for solving the problem. ", " \u201cIn some ways, you have the agreement that was brokered by the U.S. and China going straight into the U.N. process,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s Climate Program. ", " The Lima agreement offered few details on the legal scope of the final Paris deal. While unlikely to embrace a treaty the Senate would have to ratify, the U.S. has supported a broader approach that would make certain aspects of the agreement legally binding on an international level. ", " \u201cParis is expected to be a legal agreement,\u201d said Elliot Diringer, a former Clinton administration environmental adviser who is now executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. \u201cBut one of the central issues is precisely which parts of the agreement will be legally binding.\u201d ", " The Lima talks fell into a pattern that felt familiar from past climate negotiations: Delegates entered feeling optimistic but progress remained slow until the final days of the talks, when clashes between richer and poorer nations threatened to bring about a collapse. Then, hours after the talks had been slated to end, countries reached a watered-down agreement. ", " Officials hope that Paris will be different, but first negotiators will be meeting in in New York City in June for another high-level climate summit. Interim meetings will also take place in Germany and Switzerland. ", " Scientists say nations must take drastic steps in the coming decades to hold the average global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels \u2014 the threshold that many believe would help avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change, though significant damage would still occur. A United Nations Environment Programme report released last month said the planet needs to be essentially carbon-neutral between 2055 and 2070 to prevent a 2-degree increase. ", " Almost nobody following the talks thinks the Paris deal by itself will allow the world to meet that target. One early December ", " by climate analysts at the New Climate Institute and other groups estimated that the post-2020 targets announced by the United States, China and the European Union would merely reduce the projected warming to 2.9 to 3.1 degrees Celsius. ", " \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in this process who thinks this is a silver bullet to 2 degrees,\u201d Coleman said, arguing that countries need to take additional steps outside of the U.N. process to further reduce pollution. \u201cWe all recognize and understand that this process is not enough. The process is flawed, and the outcomes are flawed, and you\u2019re always going to have it with 196 countries at the table. But it\u2019s necessary.\u201d ", " Others were more pessimistic about what came out of Lima.

Ethanol producers say the oil companies are just afraid of competition. ", " Cruz has sponsored a Senate bill to phase out the requirement over five years. While Bush, former New York Gov.

At the end, her brain was so swollen she couldn\u2019t breathe on her own. Frey, 81, was one of seven fatalities in a listeria outbreak caused by caramel apples that spread to 12 states. Common bacteria such as listeria, salmonella and E. coli kill several thousand people each year and sicken some 48 million Americans.

The law mandated more inspections and much tougher anti-contamination standards for everything from peaches to imported pesto sauce, and it placed more emphasis on preventing outbreaks than on chasing them down after people become sick. \n ", " ", " But almost five years later, not one of the sweeping new rules has been implemented and funding is more than $276 million behind where it needs to be. A law that could have been legacy-defining for President Barack Obama instead represents a startling example of a broad and bipartisan policy initiative stymied by politics and the neglect of some of its strongest proponents. \n ", " ", " The breakdown of food-safety reform is also a reminder of how quickly momentum can be lost without leadership. The White House has routinely put nutrition policy ahead of food safety, sat on key regulations for months and made only halfhearted attempts to fund the law, according to dozens of interviews with current and former government officials, industry leaders and consumer advocates. Congress, too, bears blame: With no real pressure from the White House or the public, Capitol Hill has given the FDA less than half of what the agency says it needs to actually enforce the new rules, once they take effect. And many of the industry lobbyists and advocates who once championed the measure have turned their attention to other, more pressing policy battles. \n ", " ", " In the meantime, deadly outbreaks like the one that killed Shirlee Frey, and another earlier this year that resulted in the recall of Blue Bell Creameries\u2019 entire ice cream inventory, keep happening. Since Obama signed the new law, outbreaks involving cantaloupes, salad greens, pomegranate seeds, sushi tuna and cilantro \u2014 to name a few of the more publicized incidents \u2014 have sickened thousands and killed several dozen people. And the threat posed by an increasingly exotic food system keeps growing: Two decades ago, the FDA oversaw 200,000 imports; last year there were 12 million, accounting for roughly 15 percent of the nation\u2019s food supply. \n ", " ", " Obama\u2019s new budget calls for $109 million increase to implement the law next year. It\u2019s a sudden reawakening of White House interest, more than four times what the administration requested last year, but still far short of what is needed to make the law work as intended, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Besides, Congress, dominated by Republicans focused on squeezing federal budgets, is not likely even to grant that much. \n ", " ", " \u201cYou can\u2019t do a new job without new resources,\u201d said Michael Taylor, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. \n ", " ", " \u201cAt this juncture,\u201d he added, \u201cFSMA either succeeds \u2026 or it falls off the rails.\u201d \n ", " ", " ", " ", " The American food-safety system was born out of crisis. At the turn of the 20th century, Harvey Washington Wiley, an intrepid government chemist, and Upton Sinclair, author of \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d horrified the nation by uncovering widespread food fraud and grotesque conditions in Chicago meat plants. Congress responded by passing the first major safety laws: the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and Federal Meat Inspection Act. ", " In the years since, oversight of food has unfolded in a piecemeal and reactive fashion: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 after 100 people died from a toxic quack medicine for strep throat. President Richard M. Nixon ordered a sweeping review of food additives when it was believed that saccharine caused cancer. President Bill Clinton cracked down on E. coli in meat after four children died from undercooked fast-food hamburgers. President George W. Bush mandated that food facilities register with the government in the wake of 9/11. ", " The patchwork response has created a regulatory monstrosity of a dozen poorly coordinated federal agencies that give the illusion of comprehensive coverage but in reality are woefully inadequate to the task of protecting the nation\u2019s food supply. The Department of Agriculture oversees meat and poultry, and the FDA oversees just about everything else. But the lines of jurisdiction have been mocked for decades \u2014 cheese pizza falls under the FDA\u2019s purview, but not pepperoni pizza. The same divide holds true for soups, sauces and other processed foods \u2014 if it has meat, it falls to the USDA \u2013 except for eggs. Eggs are regulated by the FDA, unless the egg is cracked and processed \u2014 then it\u2019s the USDA\u2019s job. Since 2007, the Government Accountability Office has rated the food-safety system one of the areas most in need of reform for being fragmented and ineffective, right up there with homeland security and the government\u2019s patchy cyberdefense.

", " ", " ", " ", ": Scientists are still uncertain what caused the outbreak: Could the stick inside the caramel apple have pushed listeria inside the fruit? Are apples more at risk for listeria than previously thought? Bidart faces multiple lawsuits, including one from the Freys, as is Safeway and Happy Apple. In Shirlee Frey\u2019s case, there are still questions: Did she fall because she was weak from listeriosis? Or did the brain surgery make her particularly vulnerable to infection? Her family is convinced she would still be alive if she hadn\u2019t eaten the apples. ", " ", " ", " Obama\u2019s food crisis was waiting for him as he took office in 2009: an unfolding salmonella outbreak that ultimately killed nine and sickened 714 across 46 states. The source was a filthy factory in Georgia that made peanut butter for everything from Clif bars to Keebler crackers. Thousands of products were recalled as hundreds of children fell ill, riveting the nation\u2019s \u2014 and Congress\u2019 \u2014 attention. ", " At a 2009 oversight hearing on the outbreak, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) was exasperated. Congress had held hearing after hearing on food safety, she said, but hadn\u2019t passed meaningful reform. \u201cHow many sick kids does it really take for us to finally act?\u201d ", " Obama\u2019s tone was equally as urgent when he appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show and spoke about the government\u2019s obligations to ensure food safety. \u201cAt a bare minimum, we should be able to count on our government keeping our kids safe when they eat peanut butter,\u201d he said, referring to his youngest daughter: \u201cThat\u2019s what Sasha eats for lunch.\u201d ", " But the part of the government responsible for keeping kids\u2019 peanut butter safe was a chronically understaffed unit of the FDA called the Office of Regulatory Affairs. ", " In 2009, ORA had fewer than 700 food inspectors (calculated in full-time employees) to cover hundreds of thousands of food facilities. By comparison, at the Department of Agriculture, which oversees all meat processing, the ratio is flipped: There\u2019s more than one inspector for every one of the 6,200 facilities, and they\u2019re on site around the clock. That level of scrutiny is a vestige of Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s reforms: Meat companies by law aren\u2019t allowed to operate without an inspector on hand. The FDA has had no similar mandate, so its workforce never kept pace. ", " For decades, the ORA\u2019s inspection force has been dwarfed by the number of companies the agency oversees. And as the food system has become increasingly globalized, the gap between the FDA\u2019s capacity and its vast jurisdiction has grown exponentially. U.S. food companies might get inspected every four to five years, and the overwhelming majority of foreign producers never get inspected at all. The ORA now has about 1,100 food-safety inspectors \u2014 a seemingly large increase since 2009 but still a tiny force compared with the 377,000 domestic and foreign facilities it is nominally in charge of monitoring. ", " The FDA\u2019s foods program also has significantly lagged in funding over the years. In the 1970s, close to half the agency\u2019s budget was spent on food safety and nutrition. Today, it\u2019s closer to one-fifth. Spending on drugs and medical device programs has boomed \u2014 a trend fueled largely by industry user fees. Drug and device companies have an economic incentive to keep FDA well-staffed to speed product approvals, but there is no such incentive for food-safety inspections. ", " The consequence of ORA\u2019s understaffing was on full display in the 2009 peanut butter disaster. At the time of the outbreak, federal officials hadn\u2019t inspected the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s Blakely, Georgia, plant since 2001, years before the company had started making peanut butter. State inspectors, under contract with the FDA, had visited the plant in 2007 and 2008 and found numerous sanitation problems that the company committed to correcting. But no tests for salmonella were done. ", " ", " ", " ", ", deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at FDA, the leader of the effort to implement the Food Safety Modernization Act.

", " ", " ", " ", ", associate commissioner for regulatory affairs, the current head of the FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs, which oversees food and drug safety inspections. ", " Food-safety experts recognize that there will never be enough resources, or FDA inspectors, to have the same level of coverage that the USDA has over meat plants, but food-safety inspections are seen as critical to ensuring that food companies are actually following the new food safety rules. ORA declined interview requests about staffing levels and the food-safety law, citing the fact that the final regulations have not been issued. \n ", " ", " \u201cYou could double the workforce and it would not cover the industry all that well, either,\u201d said a former FDA official. Even if the agency could multiply its inspection force so it could pop into a food facility twice a year, it would still just be \u201ca spot check\u201d because that plant might be operating three shifts a day, 365 days a year. Nevertheless, the official said, \u201cThe spot checks are still important,\u201d just like \u201cit\u2019s important for a cop car to sit on the side of the road to deter speeding.\u201d \n ", " ", " When federal investigators finally set foot in the Georgia peanut butter plant in 2009 \u2014 four months after people began getting sick \u2014 they discovered evidence of roaches and a leaky roof that, a company employee later said, had allowed bird feces to drop into the plant. Officials also discovered that the company had been testing its products for salmonella, but it had disregarded positive results and shipped products anyway. \n ", " ", " Few members of Congress expressed as much anger over the incident as Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who had several constituents fall ill during the outbreak. During one hearing, he dared Stewart Parnell, PCA\u2019s chief executive, to eat recalled products he had brought in a large jar wrapped in yellow caution tape. Parnell declined (and refused to testify, invoking his right against self-incrimination.) \n ", " ", " That bipartisan outrage was sustained by a powerful alliance of consumer groups and the much deeper-pocketed food industry, which had become increasingly anxious about eroding consumer confidence and the staggering costs to businesses. Given the historic lack of a powerful constituency pushing for stronger oversight of the nation\u2019s food supply, the breadth of the coalition was unique and effective. \n ", " ", " \u201cThis legislation means that parents who tell their kids to eat their spinach can be assured it won\u2019t make them sick,\u201d declared Sen. Tom Harkin in December 2010. The Iowa Democrat had worked closely with Sen. Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, to bring the law to the finish line. The Senate cleared the bill 73-25. \n ", " ", " ", " ", " The January 2011 signing ceremony for the landmark Food Safety Modernization Act should have been the first clue something was amiss. ", " There wasn\u2019t one. No kids. No media photo ops. The president signed the bill alone. ", " The Democrats, and therefore the White House, had just endured a thrashing in the 2010 midterm elections and food safety was not a priority. ", " Despite the lack of fanfare, the White House appeared committed to funding the new law. The Congressional Budget Office had estimated that the FDA would need $583 million added to its less than $4 billion base over five years \u2014 or an increase of roughly $116 million each year \u2014 to boost the agency\u2019s capacity to prevent outbreaks. The administration\u2019s fiscal 2012 request for a $183 million increase far exceeded that \u2014 a big ask considering the House had flipped to conservative control. Congress ultimately gave the FDA a $46 million bump, just less than 40 percent of what CBO said was needed. ", " The following year, the administration capitulated, seeking a minuscule $6 million increase and relied instead on the idea that new industry fees could fund the difference. The White House proposed more than $240 million in fees that year, a politically toxic and unrealistic approach that drew scorn from industry groups, which argued that registration and inspection fees would be an unfair tax on food. Congress granted FDA a $37 million increase that year. ", " It was the beginning of a worrisome trend. Each year, the White House asked Congress for far less than what FDA needed and Congress more or less agreed. All the while, the administration continued to float the unpalatable idea of industry fees. In 2015, the White House asked for such a small increase ($24 million) that Congress again exceeded the president\u2019s request by several million dollars. ", " The funding for the new law was way behind, but so were the new rules that were at the heart of the reform. ", " As soon as Obama signed the law, the clock started ticking to get the four biggest rules out within the year. By the end of 2011, the FDA had drafted a rule requiring food makers to limit potential hazards, whether through better cleaning or simply keeping rodents out. The agency drew up a similar rule to keep contamination from spreading in animal feed and pet food. FDA also drafted tough new rules for food importers and produce growers.

The network of schools for Native American children run by an obscure agency of the Interior Department remains arguably the worst school system in the United States, a disgrace the government has known about for eight decades and never successfully reformed. Earlier this fall, POLITICO asked President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of education, Arne Duncan, about what is perhaps the federal government\u2019s longest-running problem: \u201cIt's just the epitome of broken,\u201d he said. \u201cJust utterly bankrupt.\u201d ", "The epitome of broken looks like Crystal Boarding School. ", "Tucked into the desert hills on a Navajo reservation 150 miles east of the Grand Canyon, Crystal has cracks running several feet down the walls, leaky pipes in the floors and asbestos in the basement. Students come from extremely troubled backgrounds, but there is no full-time counselor. Last year, a new reading coach took one look at the rundown cinder block housing and left the next day. Science and social studies have been cut to put more attention on the abysmal reading and math scores, but even so, in 2013 only 5 percent of students were considered to have grade-level math skills.", "\u201cI don't even know what to say,\u201d said Duncan. \u201cIt's just not right.\u201d", "Crystal is one of 183 schools for Native American children scattered across reservations in 23 states and reporting to the federal Bureau of Indian Education, a small agency buried deep inside the sprawling and compartmentalized bureaucracy of the Department of the Interior. The 48,000 students unfortunate enough to attend BIE schools have some of the lowest test scores and graduation rates in the country \u2014 even as the education they\u2019re getting is among the nation\u2019s most expensive: At $15,000 per pupil, the system costs 56 percent more than the national average. ", "\u201cFrankly, we spend an enormous amount per student relative to other school systems for terrible results,\u201d Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said.", "A year ago, Obama decided to finally tackle the problem, a decision he pushed his team to make after an emotional visit to a Sioux reservation in the Dakotas. He told his Cabinet to \u201cestablish a pathway that leads to change\u201d and that he would hold them accountable. His Interior Department has proposed a sweeping plan to allow more tribal control over the schools and rework the Bureau of Indian Education into a streamlined, modern school system \u2014 preferably before the end of Obama's term. But resistance, both within the agency and on the reservations, is high. Critics say the changes are rushed and poorly communicated. They warn that paring back the federal government\u2019s role will only make it easier to under-invest in schools that, by almost any measure, need money and resources the most.", "When all the Washington fighting is over, it\u2019s possible, those critics say, that some of the worst schools in America will get even worse.", "***", "In the wake of the Civil War, as the federal government forcibly uprooted Native American tribes across the continent, some progressive educators saw an opportunity to remake Indian children in their own image.", "One of these people was a former U.S. Army officer named Richard Henry Pratt, who founded in 1879 an Indian school in Pennsylvania, about 30 miles north of the Gettysburg battlefield, with authorization from the federal government. At Pratt\u2019s Carlisle Indian Industrial School, students were banned from speaking their Native languages, dressed to look like white students and were even given new names. Dozens more boarding schools followed, all overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "When families balked at sending their children thousands of miles from home so that they could be taught to reject their own culture, Congress authorized the secretary of the interior, who was in charge of all matters relating to the tribes, to withhold food from any family that didn't turn over their children. ", "In time, this forced assimilation came to be seen for the abuse that it was. A 1928 report commissioned by the Interior Department found that teachers were underqualified and that malnourished students were, in the name of vocational training, put to work at jobs that may have violated child labor laws. So the government began closing down the boarding schools and replaced them with on-reservation schools like Crystal, which was built in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. ", "But attempts to devolve more authority to the tribes lasted only until World War II, when a House Select Committee on Indian Affairs proposed \u201ca final solution of the Indian problem,\u201d a culture-busting program that involved sending children to schools far from their reservations. \u201cThe goal of Indian education,\u201d according to the committee, \u201cshould be to make the Indian child a better American rather than to equip him to be a better Indian.\u201d", "In the mid-1960s, with pressure mounting once again to give the tribes more authority, a private nonprofit organization, using money from the Office of Economic Opportunity, built the Rough Rock Demonstration School on the Navajo reservation in northern Arizona. Educators Robert and Ruth Roessel created a twin curriculum that taught Native American language and culture alongside traditional courses. The Roessels enrolled their son, Charles \u201cMonty\u201d Roessel, who is now the director of BIE, as a kindergartener.", "But even after a law was passed in 1978 aimed at giving tribes the same kind of control as the five-member school board that ran Rough Rock, the internal workings of the Bureau of Indian Affairs were still broken. ", "While one office (which would later be called the Bureau of Indian Education) handled educational matters, other offices within the larger Bureau of Indian Affairs had say over school construction and maintenance, personnel and technology, all of which are major parts of school operations. The tribes also have some power and, particularly in the Southwest, so do school boards, which further diffuses the authority \u2014 and the accountability over the schools\u2019 failures \u2014 across the country. ", "In 1988, yet another report commissioned by the Department of the Interior blamed the uniformly woeful test scores on poor leadership \u2014 from Washington, where acting directors came and went, to the local level, where principals turned over at a rate of 33 percent every year.", "\n                            Clockwise: Using decades-old playground equipment, a student plays on a merry-go-round at Cove Day School in Red Valley, Ariz.

The other offices within Indian Affairs \u201chave no background in education and how to run an educational bureau well, but they\u2019re making critical decisions,\u201d Moore said.

His three-year term 1992 to 1995 made him one of the longest-serving directors. ", "The agenda of the day rarely favored Indian schools. ", "President Bill Clinton made an effort to improve the BIE, starting a program to train more Native American teachers and asking for funds to fix rundown schools. The program was successful in training more Native teachers but has dwindled over time. And the school construction money, though helpful, didn't come close to solving the need, said David Beaulieu, who directed the Education Department's Indian education programs from 1997 to 2001.", "\"It was just a drop in the bucket,\" Beaulieu said.", "President George W. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind program, which aimed to bring accountability to schools, was especially hard to implement at BIE. Administrators struggle to comply with local tests and standards in 23 different states.", "Like Clinton, Bush pushed for new construction for BIE schools. In 2004, the administration put out a list of the 14 schools in the poorest condition and began working on replacements. But 11 years later, two of the schools \u2014 both on the Navajo reservation \u2014 have yet to get replacements. The total cost would be $40 million. More schools fell into poor condition in the meantime; it would now take roughly $1.3 billion to bring the 60-plus schools that need new buildings up to shape, the Interior Department estimates. ", "During the Obama administration\u2019s first term, BIE limped along as it had for years. School construction budgets for schools dwindled under competing administration priorities and twice the administration didn\u2019t propose any money for new BIE schools. Meanwhile, a parade of directors \u2014 three in four years \u2014\u2014 gave the agency inconsistent oversight. ", "Keith Moore\u2019s chief of staff, Brian Drapeaux, replaced him after Moore left as acting director. Later, Moore and Drapeaux were shown to have violated the department\u2019s ethics by its inspector general. Drapeaux had ties to a South Dakota business applying for an $800,000-plus contract with BIE and was asked to recuse himself but didn\u2019t, the inspector general found. A district attorney in South Dakota declined to prosecute. ", "Other government investigations have found numerous examples of embezzlement and misspent money. The GAO found that 24 BIE schools inappropriately spent $13.8 million during the first half of 2014. In a small but telling case, the Interior Department paid in advance for a $1.5 million bus garage, but when the project was completed the garage doors couldn\u2019t close if a large bus was inside for repairs. In 2013, a BIE employee was convicted for embezzling more than $23,000 from a charity fund for school supplies, which she spent on clothing, salon visits and a trip to Las Vegas. In 2011, a group of tribal members had to repay $625,000 they had embezzled over roughly a year and a half from BIE school funds.", "When Secretary Sally Jewell arrived at the Department of Interior in the spring of 2013, she was warned by her predecessor, Ken Salazar, that the BIE schools were \u201ca difficult part of our portfolio,\u201d Jewell told POLITICO. She began consulting with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, in part to ask why the Interior Department \u2014 rather than Education \u2014 was even running a school system. The answer was part legacy \u2014 it's always been Interior's responsibility because there was no such thing as a Department of Education back when the treaties were signed \u2014 and part structural \u2014 the Department of Education provides funding, but it does not run schools. And besides, it wasn't like anyone was rushing to add a mess like BIE to its portfolio.", "Jewell put together a team to map how to modernize BIE. Experts were brought in from Brown University and the Department of Defense, which runs its own school system composed of 175 schools at bases around the world, but which has had far better results than BIE.", "Director of the Bureau of Indian Education since 2013, Roessel is at the center of efforts to the reform the agency.", "He led the BIE during the first Clinton administration.

BIE should replace old schools, according to the plan, and give teachers extensive professional development. The changes should", "give tribes more control and BIE schools more leeway to teach Native American culture, which had been squeezed out by the emphasis on testing. ", "But Jewell couldn\u2019t do much on her own: She needed Congress to give her money to build schools and to approve the agency\u2019s new structure and any changes in personnel. BIE employees, some of whom had worked at the agency for decades, would need to support the changes or leave and be replaced. And skeptical tribes had to want more autonomy over the schools, rather than defer to BIE.

With almost no one else in the room, the students opened up about challenges they faced growing up on the reservation. They talked about loved ones having addiction problems or attempting suicide.

Two top administration officials told POLITICO it was the most emotional they\u2019ve ever seen the president, even though it had been weeks since his return from the reservation.", "The president\u2019s support gave momentum to Jewell\u2019s plans, which at that point existed mostly on paper. After years of requesting little or no money for new construction, the White House once again asked Congress for money to replace rundown schools. It started seeking out permission from lawmakers to overhaul the BIE\u2019s tangled bureaucracy as Jewell\u2019s team had advised. That December, the White House announced a range of other minor initiatives to help Native youth.", "Some, including the superintendent of the Navajo schools, are throwing their weight behind the president's plan and working to sell it on the ground.", "But the proposed reforms have met with deep skepticism on many reservations, where people have seen waves of reform come and go.", "\u201cThey\u2019re washing their hands,\u201d said Lee B.

They could very well lead to his school having higher overhead costs, or having to merge with another school 20 miles", "down the road. ", "But above all, Roy is concerned giving more control to the tribe will make it even easier to ignore and overlook the BIE schools. The community agrees, and has passed a resolution formally opposing the reforms. In the Dakotas, where skepticism of the reforms runs even deeper than in Navajo country, one tribe filed a motion in court to stop the changes. School board members like Roy, who could wind up losing their posts if tribes opt to consolidate the school board structure, feel particularly threatened by the changes. Many in the BIE school system say the plan has been poorly communicated, and that tribes won\u2019t all buy in to Obama\u2019s plans. ", "Tippeconnic, the former BIE director, is similarly concerned. ", "\u201cI think on paper it looks really good,\u201d Tippeconnic said. \u201cBut I seriously don\u2019t think BIE has that capacity to provide educational support, technical assistance, professional development.\u201d ", "Tippeconnic said he supports more self-rule for the schools, but only after the tribes are prepared to do the job. In the meantime, he recommends recruiting and training better leaders for BIE; helping tribal leaders and school boards better understand education; hiring good teachers in the classrooms. ", "Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the Chickasaw Nation, told POLITICO that finding ways to encourage teachers to come teach at BIE schools through better housing or policies like student loan forgiveness could help the agency \u201cattract and retain really top notch people\u201d in classrooms.", "Cole supports Obama's plans, but sees much more that needs to be done in BIE schools. Even administration officials have openly said that, if the reforms are done well, they will only begin to solve the BIE\u2019s problems after years of neglect.", "\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, quite frankly.

In the Senate, however, the panel that writes spending bills for the Department of the Interior is chaired by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has no BIE schools in her state. Murkowski recommended a small pool of funds, $23 million, for new schools this year. Murkowski's office did not respond to requests for comment.", "By contrast, the 175 schools run by the Department of Defense handily persuaded Congress to fund new school construction several years ago.

Students often come from difficult backgrounds, resources are scarce and when there isn\u2019t adequate housing some teachers drive hours onto a reservation to teach each day. Even when teachers apply to a school, the bureaucracy can make it difficult to get them into the classroom. Teachers at the BIE schools with the highest level of federal involvement earn salaries that are higher on average than teachers at other schools; a new teacher with a bachelor\u2018s degree earned a starting salary of $39,775 at a BIE school in 2011, compared to an average of $33,200 at a rural public school.

When student performance is compared to students in large urban school districts that, like the BIE, serve many low-income students, the BIE again falls short.

Scott Mahaskey/Politico", " ", " In September 2011, as the U.S. economy continued to sputter in the shadow of the Great Recession, Jonathan Adelstein offered a bold promise on behalf of a tiny federal agency that had long strived to improve the lives of rural Americans. ", "Story Continued Below", " The administrator of the little-known Rural Utilities Service had just finished announcing $3.5 billion in aid to expand high-speed Internet access to the hardest-to-reach areas of the country. The awards, part of the federal stimulus passed by Congress two years earlier, had been crucial to President Barack Obama\u2019s blueprint for a recovery that would ensure farmers and remote businesses could compete in an increasingly global economy. ", " \u201cThese investments in broadband will connect nearly 7 million rural Americans,\u201d Adelstein pledged in a report to Congress, \u201calong with more than 360,000 businesses and more than 30,000 critical community institutions like schools, health care facilities and public safety agencies, to new or improved service.\u201d ", " Judged against the agency\u2019s 80-year track record, those numbers didn\u2019t seem unrealistically ambitious. During the Great Depression, after all, RUS had loaned out millions of dollars to string electric lines to distant farms and small towns in parts of the country that private companies refused to serve \u2014 a bold and calculated risk that had transformed America in a single generation. ", " But more recently, RUS has strayed from its rural mission. Even the agency\u2019s staunchest defenders in Congress have learned: When it came to funding broadband projects, RUS never found its footing in the digital age. ", " Sometimes, RUS funded high-speed Internet in well-wired population centers. Sometimes, it chose not to make any loans at all. Sometimes, RUS broadband projects stumbled, or failed for want of proper management; loans went delinquent and some borrowers defaulted. Yet despite years of costly missteps that left millions of Americans stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide, a stable of friendly lawmakers swallowed their doubts about RUS and made sure the politically protected agency wasn\u2019t cut out of the historic stimulus effort. ", " It should come as little surprise, then, that four years and four directors later, RUS has failed to deliver on Adelstein\u2019s promise. ", " A POLITICO investigation has found that roughly half of the nearly 300 projects RUS approved as part of the 2009 Recovery Act have not yet drawn down the full amounts they were awarded. All RUS-funded infrastructure projects were supposed to have completed construction by the end of June, but the agency has declined to say whether these rural networks have been completed. More than 40 of the projects RUS initially approved never got started at all, raising questions about how RUS screened its applicants and made its decisions in the first place. ", " But a bigger, more critical deadline looms for those broadband projects still underway: If these networks do not draw all their cash by the end of September, they will have to forfeit what remains. In other words, they may altogether squander as much as $277 million in still-untapped federal funds, which can\u2019t be spent elsewhere in other neglected rural communities. ", " And either way, scores of rural residents who should have benefited from better Internet access \u2014 a utility that many consider as essential as electricity \u2014 might continue to lack access to the sort of reliable, high-speed service that is common in America\u2019s cities. Even RUS admits it\u2019s not going to provide better service to the 7 million residents it once touted; instead, the number is in the hundreds of thousands. ", " The checkered performance of RUS offers an all-too-familiar story of an obscure federal agency that has grown despite documented failures, thanks in large part to its political patrons in Congress. The massive infusion of stimulus money, which required RUS to disperse record sums faster than it ever had before, further exposed its weaknesses \u2014 troubles that in many ways remain unaddressed, despite repeated warnings \u2014 even as RUS continues lending. ", " \u201cWe are left with a program that spent $3 billion,\u201d Mark Goldstein, an investigator at the Government Accountability Office, told POLITICO, \u201cand we really don\u2019t know what became of it.\u201d ", " ", " ", " It took a bigger economic crisis, more than eight decades earlier, to bring RUS into existence. The agency, known then as the Rural Electrification Administration, had been a centerpiece in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s historic New Deal. But the effort was controversial from the start. Private companies derided the government\u2019s investments in rural energy as \u201cBolshevik\u201d and \u201cun-American,\u201d but within several years, hundreds of public utilities were operating, and within 20 years, almost all U.S. farms had electricity. The model was so successful that REA shifted shortly after World War II to providing low-interest loans for rural telephone cooperatives. ", " Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the White House vowing to abolish REA, which he derided as \u201ccreeping socialism.\u201d Within two years, however, even he was extolling the agency\u2019s performance, praising its \u201cgreat advances for rural America.\u201d The program grew under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson; the latter in 1937 had led the formation of an electricity cooperative in the Texas Hill country. Richard M. Nixon again tried to kill it, arguing that the program had outgrown its usefulness and at that time served only \u201ccountry clubs and dilettantes.\u201d But an outraged farm bloc in Congress, led by senators such as George McGovern of South Dakota and Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, forced Nixon to back down. ", " By the end of the 20th century, REA\u2019s original electricity mission was more or less accomplished. And in 1994, REA and another agriculture program that had backed water and sewer projects were combined to form the Rural Utilities Service. Yet it was late in the Clinton administration that the agency\u2019s portfolio expanded in a way that would be as dramatic \u2014 and ultimately, as controversial \u2014 as when it began. ", " Nations like Japan and South Korea had quickly achieved nearly universal and affordable broadband coverage, but the United States was lagging. \u201cInternet access ought to be just as likely as telephone access,\u201d President Bill Clinton said in April 2000. That year, Clinton\u2019s budget included $102 million for a pilot broadband program to be administered by RUS, building on its previous telecom work. ", " Bolstered by a 2001 Brookings Institution study that estimated widespread adoption of basic broadband could add $500 billion to the U.S. economy, Congress approved permanent funding for the program. In the eyes of allies like Montana Sen. Conrad Burns, robust, widespread Internet access \u201cwould be as important to the national destiny as the railroads in the 19th century. \u2026 Universal broadband should be the national priority \u2026 (the) same way as putting a man on the moon was.\u201d And low-interest federal loans, he believed, were the best way to do it. \u201cThe RUS telecom program has never issued a bad loan in over 50 years,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThe government has actually made money off of those loans.\u201d ", " In 2004, President George W. Bush proposed that broadband coverage should be universally available within three years. His support touched a nerve with Iowa\u2019s Sen. Tom Harkin, a powerful Democrat who knew that one of the government\u2019s primary mechanisms for meeting that goal was not up to the task. At a confirmation hearing for James Andrew, who eventually would take over RUS under Bush, Harkin recalled an encounter with the president in which he confided that universal broadband would never happen if RUS didn\u2019t start spending money. ", " \u201cWe put in $2 billion (to the farm bill) to do that,\u201d the senator grumbled to Bush, \u201cbut the Department of Agriculture has been dragging its feet.\u201d By making onerous demands on its applicants and keeping them waiting months for approval, Harkin said RUS had managed to leave $1.6 billion on the table. ", " \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound too cynical,\u201d Harkin told Andrew, \u201cbut it almost sounds like the cable companies and the big phone companies have gotten to somebody and said, \u2018We don\u2019t want this program to work.\u2019\u201d ", " Harkin then delivered to Andrew a brief sermon on the mission of RUS: \u201cWe were not risk averse when we put telephone lines out to farmsteads and our small towns in America. We knew there was risk in doing that, but we managed it. RUS manages risk. And that is what I am asking in broadband, manage risk. Don\u2019t be so risk averse that you say, \u2018We cannot give a loan out there because we want to make 100 percent certain that the company we give it to will not default and will not fail. Some of them will \u2026\u201d ", " President Clinton proposed the first dramatic expansion of the Rural Utilities Service to include broadband access.

", " The spirit of the law always had been for RUS to target its broadband aid to the most remote, neglected rural towns. In the earliest years of the broadband program, administered chiefly at the time by Bush-appointee Hilda Legg, RUS seemed to believe it had a much broader mandate \u2014 and it wrote multiple sets of rules that permitted it to provide aid to \u201cany definable tract of land where fewer than 20,000 people live.\u201d That metric essentially allowed areas under development or near larger, suburban areas to receive federal cash. ", " In the end, the watchdog\u2019s probe found, \u201c64 communities near large cities received loans and grants totaling $103.4 million.\u201d These networks, in a sense, were easier to build: They were located in denser communities, where a lower price tag for buildout and a higher demand for faster service made it easier to recover costs. But they weren\u2019t in the rural, unserved areas where many in Congress wanted RUS to focus its attention. ", " Federal investigators also calculated that RUS had awarded more than $137 million in loans, despite incomplete or inaccurate applications. About $30 million of its loans \u201c[were] in default due to inadequate servicing,\u201d largely because the agency hadn\u2019t developed strong oversight guidelines for its earliest loans \u2014 meaning the cash wasn\u2019t \u201ctimely and thoroughly monitored.\u201d And another $6.8 million in canceled broadband loans \u201cwas not put to use in a timely fashion and was therefore unavailable for future funding.\u201d ", " With the election of Obama, broadband expansion gained another prominent champion, one who had been determined to use the federal stimulus to boost Internet investments \u201cso that a small business in a rural town,\u201d he said in a January 2009 speech, \u201ccan connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world.\u201d ", " Fiscal conservatives, already fighting what would become the $800 billion stimulus package, zeroed in on the broadband program, resurrecting the decades-old complaint that it was an improper intrusion by the federal government into the free market. But Harkin, and other prominent lawmakers from farm states, ensured that RUS still received several billion dollars from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ", " \u201cThey\u2019ve been involved in loans and loan guarantees and things like that since 1949,\u201d Harkin said at the time, \u201cso they know how to do these things.\u201d ", " ", " ", " Except, RUS didn\u2019t. Miserly and risk averse at times \u2014 and unfocused and overly generous at others \u2014 the rural regulator arrived at its monumental stimulus task with more questions than answers. ", " The Obama administration insisted on funding \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects, but the broadband networks RUS had been asked to support would require considerable time to design, obtain permits to bury lines or hang them from poles, and address environmental concerns. Complicating things, the agency would have to award its billions of dollars without fully knowing what parts of the country needed the most help. An effort to map the communities with the worst high-speed connections, another requirement of the Recovery Act, would take years to complete \u2014 a cart-before-the-horse approach that stimulus skeptics ridiculed. ", " \u201cI just fought and fought because, if you\u2019re going to spend the taxpayers\u2019 money, then you should spend it where nobody else will spend it,\u201d recalled Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) in a recent interview. He offered an amendment during an early markup of the Recovery Act, but Democrats, who felt mapping would slow investment, voted it down. ", " To top it all, there was another catch: RUS would have to commit to spending all the money by Sept. 30, 2010, and make sure construction on those projects were \u201csubstantially complete\u201d no later than two years after getting the funds. The drop-dead deadline would be Sept. 30, 2015: After that, any unspent money would be taken back. ", " The $66-million project known as Lake Connections(1) in northeast Minnesota is typical of the many broadband projects funded by the Rural Utilities Service that have had difficulty finishing. Lake Connections has encountered delays from harsh winter weather as well as opposition from RUS officials in Washington, who cut off funds in October for several months, forcing the project to commit local tax dollars. In May, a contractor buried fiber optic cable (2), secured fiber optic connections at a remote control unit (3) and connected the line to a residential customer (4). M. Scott Mahaskey/Politico photos ", " Already shaky on execution, RUS began to tackle its monumental stimulus workload without a full-time administrator. On March 20, 2009, Obama nominated Adelstein, then a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, to lead the rural agency. The nomination came about a month after the Recovery Act became law. ", " Adelstein, a South Dakotan by birth, could appreciate the agency\u2019s mission. And while serving at the FCC, he had worked closely on a number of initiatives to improve broadband access in unserved rural towns. But some wondered whether Adelstein, a former top aide to Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), was suited for the immense challenge the stimulus presented. To at least one former official who worked on the law, Adelstein appeared to be \u201cvery much a Hill staffer put in the role of a banker, [who] approached it more like a Hill staffer than banker.\u201d ", " But Adelstein at least knew the stakes. Not only had he worked on the 2002 law that helped usher in a new broadband era for RUS, he heard an earful about it from the lawmakers who decided the fate of his nomination. \u201cI do not think we are ever going to see that kind of money again,\u201d lamented Harkin at a July 2009 hearing, which paved the way for Adelstein\u2019s confirmation that summer. By the time Adelstein took the reins, though, RUS had already started writing the rules for its first stimulus awards. Moreover, he had arrived on the heels of another inspector general investigation, which found \u2014 yet again \u2014 that RUS \u201ccontinued to make loans to [broadband] providers in areas with pre-existing service,\u201d while neglecting needier rural towns.

By that point, I had spent more than a quarter-century as founding director of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Information and Privacy, effectively serving as the federal government\u2019s chief information-disclosure \u201cguru.\u201d In that position, I had weathered many a Clinton records scandal during the 1990s\u2014about two dozen, all told, including two that amazingly have still never become public\u2014and I thought I had seen the last of them. At the very least, I thought I had become immune to being shocked by anything in that vein. ", " It turns out I was wrong on both counts. ", "Story Continued Below", " We now have former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton being revealed as someone who took the unprecedented step of arranging to use her personal email account for all of her official email communications. What\u2019s more, she decided to use her own email server equipment, rather than a commercial Internet service provider, so that the records of her email account would reside solely within her personal control at home. And if that were not enough, she then proceeded blithely\u2014though not uncharacteristically\u2014to present herself to the public, at a press conference held on March 10, as if there were really nothing \u201cwrong\u201d about any of this at all. ", " Well, as the saying goes, \u201creality is not her friend.\u201d ", " For anyone considering this sad tale carefully\u2014including the media, members of Congress and the public at large, whether from \u201cinside the Beltway\u201d or not\u2014some basic points of both law and reality should be borne in mind. ", " First, while it is accurate for Secretary Clinton to say that when she was in office there was not a flat, categorical prohibition on federal government officials ever using their personal email accounts for the conduct of official business, that\u2019s a far different thing from saying (as she apparently would like to) that a government official could use his or her personal email account exclusively, for all official email communications, as she actually did. In fact, the Federal Records Act dictates otherwise. ", " That law, which applies to all federal agency employees who are not within the White House itself, requires the comprehensive documentation of the conduct of official business, and it has long done so by regulating the creation, maintenance, preservation and, ultimately, the disposition of agency records. When it comes to \u201cmodern-day\u201d email communications, as compared to the paper memoranda of not so long ago, these communications now are themselves the very means of conducting official business, by definition. ", " To be sure, this cannot as a practical matter be absolute. When Obama administration officials came into office in 2009, the Federal Records Act certainly allowed room for the occasional use of a personal email account for official business where necessary\u2014such as when a secretary of state understandably must deal with a crisis around the world in the middle of the night while an official email device might not be readily at hand. That just makes sense. But even then, in such an exceptional situation, the Federal Records Act\u2019s documentation and preservation requirements still called upon that official (or a staff assistant) to forward any such email into the State Department\u2019s official records system, where it would have been located otherwise. ", " This appears to be exactly what former Secretary of State Colin Powell did during his tenure, just as other high-level government officials may do (or are supposed to do) under such exceptional circumstances during their times in office. Notwithstanding Secretary Clinton\u2019s sweeping claims to the contrary, there actually is no indication in any of the public discussions of this \u201cscandal\u201d that anyone other than she managed to do what she did (or didn\u2019t) do as a federal official. ", " Second, the official availability of official email communications is not just a matter of concern for purposes of the Federal Records Act only. It also makes an enormous (and highly foreseeable) difference to the proper implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (known as the \u201cFOIA\u201d to its friends, a group that evidently does not include Secretary Clinton). That is because the starting point for handling a FOIA request is the search that an agency must conduct for all records responsive to that request\u2019s particular specifications. So any FOIA request that requires an agency first to locate responsive email messages sent to or from that agency\u2019s head, for instance, is necessarily dependent on those records being locatable in the first place. And an agency simply cannot do that properly for any emails (let alone all such emails) that have been created, and are maintained, entirely beyond the agency\u2019s reach. Or, as it sometimes is said somewhat cynically in the FOIA community, \u201cYou can\u2019t disclose what you can\u2019t find.\u201d ", " In this case, which is truly unprecedented, no matter what Secretary Clinton would have one believe, she managed successfully\u00a0to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it\u2014perhaps forever. \u201cNice work if you can get it,\u201d one might say, especially if your experience during your husband\u2019s presidency gives you good reason (nay, even highly compelling motivation) to relegate unto yourself such control if at all possible. ", " Third, there is the compounding fact that Secretary Clinton did not merely use a personal email account; she used one that atypically operated solely through her own personal email server, which she evidently had installed in her home. This meant that, unlike the multitudes who use a Gmail account, for instance, she was able to keep her communications entirely \u201cin house,\u201d even more deeply within her personal control. No \u201ccloud\u201d for posterity, or chance of Google receiving a congressional subpoena\u2014not for her. No potentially pesky \u201cmetadata\u201d surrounding her communications or detailed server logs to complicate things. And absolutely no practical constraint on her ability to dispose of any official email of \u201chers,\u201d for any reason, at any time, entirely on her own. Bluntly put, when this unique records regime was established, somebody was asleep at the switch, at either the State Department or the National Archives and Records Administration (which oversees compliance with the Federal Records Act)\u2014or both. ", " Now, what Secretary Clinton would have one believe is that this is all just a matter of her choosing one available email option over another, that she really did nothing that her predecessors had not done before her and that she can be trusted to \u201chave absolutely confidence\u201d that what she did \u201cfully complied with every rule that [she] was governed by.\u201d In other words, the thrust of her March 10 press conference was: \u201cEverything was fine, nothing to be seen here, so let\u2019s all just move along.\u201d ", " But having spent a quarter-century at the forefront of the government\u2019s administration of the FOIA, including its transition to electronic records and its involvement in so many Clinton administration \u201cscandals du jour,\u201d I know full well that both what Secretary Clinton arranged to do and what she now has said about that are, to put it most charitably, not what either the law or anything close to candor requires. At a minimum, it was a blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better and an attempted verbal \u201ccover\u201d of the situation (if not \u201ccover-up\u201d) that is truly reminiscent of years past. ", " And I say that even as someone who, if she decides to run for president and is the Democratic nominee, will nevertheless vote for her next year.

", " The news was met with expressions of concern from some Republicans and campaign finance reformers about the group\u2019s coordination with Clinton\u2019s campaign, since they believed the group would be a standard super PAC. But it will actually be a hybrid PAC \u2014 a different kind of group from an independent expenditure committee, commonly referred to as a \u201csuper PAC\u201d \u2014 group officials told POLITICO on Friday.

Nonetheless, Clinton allies said they still expect critics to file complaints about the plan to the Federal Election Commission.

But while some said they were preparing formal complaints to the FEC, few expected any action amid a partisan divide on the six-member panel. While Democrats close to Clinton\u2019s operation insist that the maneuver is entirely legal, Republicans \u2014 some of whom are also using super PACs in novel ways in 2016 \u2014 have largely been silent.

I have no doubt that\u2019s part of the calculus of many political operatives and players in this cycle,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan of Washington\u2019s Campaign Legal Center, who has already filed campaign finance complaints against Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rick Santorum, and Martin O\u2019Malley this year \u2014 and who said he may file one against Clinton. But \u201crather than file complaints, if history is a guide, Republican operatives and their candidates may just jump on the bandwagon and do the same thing.\u201d ", " Before clarifying that the group would be a hybrid PAC, Correct the Record officials explained that since the group\u2019s work supporting Clinton is all free and online, it does not count as prohibited in-kind contributions to the Clinton campaign. Some critics claimed, however, that the exemption applies only to volunteers or other unpaid workers. Group staffers \u2014 who will be paid \u2014 explained they would be relying on an entirely separate pair of federal regulations that define coordinated communications, freeing them to use online posts.

Debbie Wasserman Schulz, who is regarded more coolly in Clinton circles \u2014 in trying to defend Clinton from partisan attacks.

Correct the Record\u2019s new position alleviates this fear, and frees the party committee to work on down-ballot races. ", " Nonetheless, the embrace of outside groups has sparked criticism of Clinton in recent weeks. She has tacitly endorsed Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing her presidential aspirations, even as she talks about reforming the campaign finance system while on the trail.

But there\u2019s also some discomfort with Clinton, the former New York senator and secretary of state, who is seen as too hawkish on foreign policy and insufficiently progressive on key issues like fighting climate change, income inequality and the role of big money in politics. Additionally, Democratic finance operatives say, efforts to rustle up seven-figure checks are suffering from a lack of a single, unifying enemy on the right. ", " All those concerns are addressed in the Brock memo, which appears to have been drafted in preparation for his appearance at the annual spring meeting of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a ", " \u2014 in April in San Francisco. The memo is written as a question-and-answer exchange between Brock and Democracy Alliance donors. ", " The memo suggests that Brock, who has built a ", " aligned with Clinton, is taking a conciliatory approach to assuage donors\u2019 concerns \u2014 conceding she\u2019s not as liberal as some donors wish but emphasizing her ", " in public service and minimizing the prospects of a vigorous Democratic primary. ", " \u201cYou say the Kochs represent all that is bad in this broken system, yet our presumptive nominee is in the pocket of big Wall Street banks,\u201d begins one of the memo\u2019s hypothetical donor questions. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to have a hard time going after the Kochs\u2019 big money when some could argue that Sec. Clinton is bank rolled by Wall Street and therefore there is a pox on both our houses?\u201d ", " The answer Brock should give, according to the memo: \u201cIt is no secret that Sec. Clinton is fair-left and not far-left. I think it is safe to say that there will be a dramatic difference between Sec. Clinton and whoever is the Republican opponent. She has spent a lifetime advocating for women and children and fighting for the middle class and there is not one GOP candidate who has that record.\u201d ", " Brock did not dispute the authenticity of the memo, which leaves a pair of questions about the internal politics of the Clinton big-money effort unanswered. But he declined to comment on the memo, or whether it reflected his fundraising approach or his presentation at the Democracy Alliance gathering, which was closed to the news media. ", " The three-day meeting of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a group that includes more than 100 individual and institutional donors and various unions \u2014 took place at San Francisco\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel just as Clinton ", " her campaign.

Many Democracy Alliance members supported then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama over Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary and urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ", ". ", " and ", " The group\u2019s importance to Democratic big money efforts was underscored by the attendance of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who held a briefing on the sidelines of the San Francisco meeting. Podesta founded the Center for American Progress think tank, which has benefited from Democracy Alliance support, and he has close relationships with many club members. At least one \u2014 CREDO Mobile co-founder Michael Kieschnick \u2014 told Podesta during the side session that his campaign role made Kieschnick more supportive of Clinton. ", " Another donor who attended, Utah-based investor Art Lipson, told POLITICO that Podesta didn\u2019t overtly seek support for Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cFirst of all, that would have gone over badly. And he is much too smart to say it and doesn\u2019t need to say it,\u201d said Lipson, who has donated about $2.5 million over the years to Democratic candidates and committees. ", " Lipson said he recently donated to a super PAC trying to draft Warren into the Democratic presidential primary. In an assessment that could apply to many Democracy Alliance members, he said \u201cher message is exactly my message, so I am 100 percent behind her. But there is no chance she is going to run.\u201d Lipson plans to attend a fundraiser this month in Salt Lake City for Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign and said the former Maryland governor \u201ccomes across as being highly intelligent.\u201d ", " Lipson said he\u2019s \u201cfine with Hillary,\u201d given \u201cthat it would take some sort of a national disaster to have some other Democratic candidate\u201d win the nomination. But he said that, while he\u2019ll vote for her over prospective Republican rivals, he does not plan to donate to her campaign, let alone any supportive super PAC. ", " Brock has sought to rally donors who might not otherwise give to Clinton by highlighting expected ", "from the most reviled of liberal boogeymen \u2014 the billionaire industrialist megadonors Charles and David Koch and their conservative political and policy network. ", " \u201cThey have their sights on Sec. Clinton,\u201d reads the memo prepared for Brock ahead of the meeting. ", " Brock spoke on a panel called \u201cThe Electoral Arms Race\u201d that focused on the unprecedented ", " planned by the Koch network in the run-up to 2016, according to ", " obtained by POLITICO. ", " At the meeting, sources say, Brock detailed a new initiative of his American Bridge political outfit to highlight key 2016 states in which Koch Industries, the brothers\u2019 multinational conglomerate, could be used against GOP candidates. The model for this project, the sources said, were the attacks that Democrat Gary Peters and his allies leveled against the Kochs and Republican Terri Lynn Land in Peters\u2019 successful 2014 Michigan Senate race. ", " \u201cThis is a brand new project, and we project it will cost around $3 million,\u201d Brock\u2019s memo reads. \u201cWe think it is critical to start the project early and we are looking for support to get staffed up very soon. We are hoping to get immediate support coming in at the $250,000 level.\u201d ", " The memo also includes responses to questions about how liberals could justify their criticism of the Koch groups for not disclosing their donors when some of Brock\u2019s groups \u2014 including Media Matters and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation \u2014 also do not disclose the identities of their donors. ", " \u201cHow can we stand up here and expect to be taken seriously talking about what they are doing when we are doing the same thing?\u201d reads one question. In the suggested answer, Brock expresses disapproval for the proliferation of so-called dark money, which ", ", but adds, \u201cWe will play by the existing rules in this election because we cannot unilaterally disarm \u2014 too much of what we care about is at stake.\u201d And he asserts: \u201cThere is a major difference here \u2014 the Kochs are flooding the political system with money for pure self interest and self gain,\u201d alleging Koch-backed groups back policies and candidates committed to \u201c[slashing] government regulations so they can pollute with abandon and increase their bottom line. People in this room are not motivated by personal gain, and often work against their own self interest.\u201d ", " The Kochs\u2019 allies reject this argument on its face, contending that their activism is motivated by a belief that society as a whole stands to benefit from small-government policies that allow the free market to thrive. ", " Told of the characterization in the memo, James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch network umbrella group Freedom Partners, said its members are focused on \u201cadvancing a future with more economic opportunities for every American.\u201d ", " Davis accused the Kochs\u2019 liberal critics of \u201claunching personal attacks and taking away those freedoms.\u201d And, alluding to support by Democrats including Clinton for reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which Freedom Partners opposes, Davis said \u201cmany of them are rigging the system to fatten their wallets with taxpayer-funded corporate welfare.

The former Florida governor has held multiple high-dollar fundraisers on Wall Street and across the country, sometimes with minimum contributions of $100,000 or even more. Many of these events raise several million dollars each, organizers say. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that cash was coming in so fast that Bush advisers counseled donors to keep donations below $1 million for the first quarter. \n ", " ", " The math to get to $100 million by March 31 is actually not that fanciful. If you have multiple donors giving $1 million each and multiple events raising $4 million or more each, the numbers add up fast. And there is a big premium on raising big money very quickly. \n ", " ", " Because he is not yet an announced candidate, Bush can raise unlimited sums for his Right to Rise super PAC. Once he announces, he will no longer be able to coordinate with the organization in any way. \n ", " ", " Analysts say the Bush team is not just managing expectations in case their fundraising falls short of lofty expectations. They are also trying to manage the optics \u2014 to avoid creating the image of a candidate who raises gobs of cash from elite donors on Wall Street and elsewhere in ways that could make the former Florida governor seem beholden to special interests. \n ", " ", " The money issue also plays into doubts grass-roots conservatives in Iowa and elsewhere already have about Bush as an establishment candidate with moderate views on education and immigration. \u201cThe drill now is you don\u2019t want to be the candidate of the billionaires and have populists like Rand Paul and [Mike] Huckabee beating the [crap] out of you.\u201d Rollins said. \u201cI\u2019d still rather have the money, but at the end of the day that\u2019s not a good place to be.\u201d \n ", " ", " Even the name of Bush\u2019s super PAC helps illustrate the problem. Bush christened the organization Right to Rise as an indicator that he would seek to enact policies that would lift middle-class Americans and even the poor to higher rungs of the economic ladder. A campaign that raises $100 million in three months in such big chunks does not necessarily seem like one aimed at the less fortunate. \n ", " ", " Whatever number Bush does wind up raising by March 31 , it might not be publicly known for a while. According to Miller, Right to Rise does not need to file disclosure reports with the Federal Election Commission \u2014 which will include totals raised and amounts by donor \u2014 until July 15. Right to Rise could decide to announce sooner. But if the PAC is embarrassed by how low \u2013 or more likely how high \u2013 the number is, the wait might last until summer. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

At another point, a tropical storm flooded the entire neighborhood so badly that neighbors used canoes to get around. ", " Now, the three-bedroom property stands as a stubborn symbol of both a politically problematic friendship and lingering questions about Rubio\u2019s personal finances, which dogged him on the campaign trail in 2010 and may do so again. The friendship has frayed in recent years, friends say, as the fortunes of Rubio, 43, and Rivera, 49, have diverged. Last week, they put the 1,228-square-foot house up for sale. The list price is $125,000 \u2014 $10,000 less than what the two men paid for it a decade ago.

A Rubio spokesman and Rivera both denied that the sale of the house had any political motivations. The home\u2019s tenant since 2010 recently moved out, and they\u2019ve been trying to sell the house, unsuccessfully, for years. ", " Asked about the status of Rubio\u2019s relationship with Rivera, which dates to 1992, when both men worked for the congressional campaign of Lincoln Diaz-Balart, spokesman Alex Burgos said in a written statement: \u201cDavid Rivera is an old friend of Senator Rubio\u2019s. His hope is that Mr. Rivera can put his recent troubles behind him and go on with his life.\u201d ", " But interviews with more than a dozen friends and political insiders who have known the two for years suggest that the story is more complicated, and that Rubio is stuck between his sense of loyalty to his friend and his need to move on with his life and political career. Three people close to Rubio say he has referred to Rivera on multiple occasions as \u201cNixonian.\u201d ", " And yet others describe a brotherly closeness that became strained only as Rivera weathered state and federal investigations into his finances, a related state ethics case that recently resulted in a proposed $58,000 fine, and the more serious campaign-finance scandal that erupted in 2012. At the time, Rubio and Rivera shared a rental home in Washington for the two years they both served in Congress. ", " \u201cMarco wants little to do with David, and you can\u2019t blame him \u2014 who would want that guy by their side as they\u2019re running for president?\u201d said Ana Alliegro, Rivera\u2019s former girlfriend, who pleaded guilty last year to campaign-finance violations and making false statements in the most recent federal case involving Rivera. She recently gave grand-jury testimony against Rivera. ", " Three people close to Marco Rubio say he has referred to David Rivera, right, on multiple occasions as \u201cNixonian.\u201d | AP Photo ", "\n  ", " ", " Alliegro confirmed she told prosecutors that Rivera was the source of about $81,000 in unreported cash that was used to fund the 2012 campaign of a political unknown who was running in the Democratic primary against Joe Garcia, a formidable contender preparing to square off against the Republican Rivera in the general election. Garcia prevailed against the candidate to whom Rivera allegedly funneled the money, Justin Sternad, who later pleaded guilty to federal charges of breaking campaign finance laws and filing false campaign reports. ", " That November, Garcia beat Rivera. Days before the election, Rubio recorded a robocall touting Rivera. Rubio also, however, made similar calls for other Republican candidates. ", " In open court and at the urging of a judge, a federal prosecutor has twice labeled Rivera as an alleged criminal conspirator in the case. But Rivera doesn\u2019t just deny wrongdoing \u2014 he claims he\u2019s not the subject of a probe. ", " \u201cAs I\u2019ve said repeatedly, no federal agency has ever said I am under investigation and no \u2018former girlfriend\u2019 has ever testified against me. That would be impossible since I have never been a defendant to be testified against,\u201d Rivera said via email. \u201cPlease send me this alleged \u2018announcement\u2019 by the federal government that I\u2019m under federal investigation and please identify the agency that announced it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNeither exist.\u201d ", " Rivera also disputed the notion that his relationship with Rubio has changed. He said the two spoke \u201crecently\u201d by phone. ", " If the two still talk, it doesn\u2019t surprise former state Rep. J.C. Planas, a Miami Republican who served with the two in the state House. Planas said Rubio was loyal to a fault and that it could prove costly in 2016. ", " \u201cDavid Rivera reminds me of the villain Iago in \u2018Othello\u2019 \u2014 and Marco\u2019s political career is Desdemona,\u201d Planas said. \u201cMarco has stood by David, and it\u2019s just baffling to me. I\u2019ve never understood their relationship.\u201d ", " Rubio owes a measure of his early success in politics to Rivera. Rivera advised and stumped for Rubio in his first campaign for the state House in 2000. Once elected, Rubio repaid the favor and helped Rivera win a state House seat in 2002. The following year, Rivera was instrumental in helping Rubio collect pledge cards from fellow Republicans to eventually become the first Cuban-American speaker of the Florida House. A relentless political operative, Rivera popped up in seemingly every corner of the state throughout the year to pressure, cajole and win over GOP House members to support Rubio for speaker. ", " As the two climbed the rungs of power together in the Florida House, they decided to buy the home at 1484 Bent Willow Drive in the Timber Lakes subdivision for $135,000. The March 2, 2005, deed was executed about a week before the 60-day lawmaking session began that year. When Rubio was formally voted speaker, he was nominated by Rivera, who served as chairman of the Florida House Rules Committee during Rubio\u2019s speakership in 2007 and 2008. The post gave Rivera life-and-death power over much of the legislation in the House. ", " Affable, intense and intelligent, Rivera was often a source of mystery to his colleagues in the part-time Florida Legislature. Year after year, his financial disclosure forms claimed income from the U.S. Agency for International Development. But years later, The Miami Herald reported that USAID had no record that he ever worked with the agency. ", " Asked what the former lawmaker was up to these days, a close ally of both men summed up the prevailing sentiment about Rivera: \u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d ", " \u201cI always thought he worked for the CIA,\u201d said Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban \u201cSteve\u201d Bovo, who served with Rivera and Rubio in the House and whose wife, Viviana, is a Rubio aide. ", " In Rivera\u2019s ethics case, investigators with the Florida Commission on Ethics and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement testified before an administrative law judge at a hearing that records showed Rivera was essentially living off political committee funds and failing to disclose the money as income. Rivera also arranged a contract worth $1 million between a Miami dog track and a company owned by his mother to lead a 2008 election campaign to legalize slot machine gambling in Miami-Dade County. Rivera later acknowledged accepting at least $132,000 as part of the arrangement. But he didn\u2019t list the money on his state financial disclosure forms. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

That\u2019s going to be a problem, too.\u201d ", " Rubio explains the GOP\u2019s dilemma like this: \u201cBasically, Barack Obama got eight out of 10 votes from the fastest-growing groups in America. And Mitt Romney got 90 percent of his votes from the group that is diminishing in terms of its overall percentage of the population. And from that, political scientists and other political observers will say, \u2018Boy, Republicans are doomed. You just take that out 20 years, 15 years, 10 years and that\u2019s the end of Republicans as a viable national party.\u2019 That\u2019s what some people will argue.\u201d ", " But the senator finishes on an optimistic note. \u201cI would encourage you to challenge that thought,\u201d he tell the class. ", " A student, presumably a Republican, chimes in with a \u201cyes\u201d that sounds almost like an \u201camen.\u201d ", " Rubio, who led a failed immigration-reform effort in 2013 that cost him some conservative support, goes on to envision a time when that issue is trumped by conservative messaging on taxes and private enterprise. ", " \u201cYou can very quickly see that suddenly Republicans are getting 40 percent of the Hispanic vote,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it may have nothing to do with immigration. It might have to do with the fact that there are a lot of Hispanics who happen to be middle class.\u201d ", " Though he generally doesn\u2019t offer detailed policy prescriptions in class, Rubio\u2019s lectures borrow heavily from his new campaign-season tome, \u201cAmerican Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone.\u201d He talks about the burden of student loan debt and muses about the fate of Taco Bell workers in a dawning era of robotic cooks and servers. ", " At a fundraiser in South Beach in January, a few weeks after the lecture, Rubio hits on many of the same elements as he speaks to donors who paid thousands of dollars to be in the room with him. Rubio began lecturing at FIU after term limits forced him in 2009 from the Florida House, where he served as speaker for two years. Because Rubio had helped steer money to the school, his teaching gig was controversial at first. Also, the idea of a teaching job for a pol rubbed some professors the wrong way in an era of budget cuts. But Democrats have since stopped criticizing the senator\u2019s teaching arrangement, even as they argue Rubio is merely offering a repackaged version of conservative proposals that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. ", " After Rubio won his U.S. Senate seat in a surprising campaign against former Gov. Charlie Crist, his political-science post won support on campus. Now, students mob him in the halls for selfies. One man, a Venezuelan national, stops him and thanks Rubio outside class for leading the effort to sanction leaders of his home country. ", " Those who have taken Rubio\u2019s class, such as Cabrera, laud him. After the last class last semester, Cabrera hung around to say goodbye to the prof he refers to as \u201cMarco\u201d \u2014 like everyone else in Miami political circles. Just as Jeb Bush is \u201cJeb\u201d and Hillary Clinton is \u201cHillary,\u201d Rubio is a first-name political commodity here. ", " \u201cMarco knows a lot. You don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s a Republican or Democrat. And you don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s a senator,\u201d said Cabrera, a Democratic-leaning independent who said he\u2019d vote for Rubio. \u201cI never got the sense he was trying to push us to one side or another. He was unbiased.\u201d ", " To make sure students walk away with that impression, Rubio laces his lectures with qualifiers about what \u201csome would say.\u201d Or he\u2019ll give the \u201cflip side\u201d of an argument. Other times, he goes out of his way to stress he\u2019s simply offering \u201cmy own personal opinion.\u201d ", " Dario Moreno, a longtime Rubio friend and FIU professor who co-teaches the class, said the senator has brought a dose of political celebrity to the university that you might be more likely to find on an Ivy League campus. FIU has a large number of middle- and lower-middle-class students, who come from backgrounds not unlike Rubio\u2019s, and that\u2019s one reason the senator enjoys teaching there. ", " \u201cIt keeps me grounded,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI learn as much from these students as they learn from me.\u201d ", " Moreno said he witnesses that during class. He also sees Rubio sorting through political problems he could face on the campaign trail. ", " \u201cThis is one of the few moments in the week when Marco can sit down and think through the issues,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cIt\u2019s safer for him to do it here than in Washington or in a room full of journalists. But I always remind him that he\u2019s always on the record.\u201d ", " Will Rubio run for president? ", " \u201cOff the record?\u201d Moreno replied with a chuckle. ", " Students say Rubio throws no haymakers at President Barack Obama or Democrats. Publicly, Rubio has knocked Hillary Clinton as a relic of the \u201c20th century\u201d; inside the classroom, he uses a similar line without mentioning Clinton by name. ", " \u201cWhat happens when you engage in a political debate and one side is arguing about stuff from the 20th century \u2026 but nobody is talking about what you feel is actually the real problem?\u201d Rubio asks students. \u201cWhat do you end up doing as a voter? You end up registering as what?\u201d ", " Half the class quickly responds: \u201cIndependent.\u201d ", " Rubio also talks about the political importance of drawing voters from an opponent\u2019s base of support. He says Bill Clinton did that by backing welfare reform and balanced budgets. ", " \u201cHe does all these sorts of things that throws people off, and \u2018triangulates\u2019 is the term they came up with,\u201d Rubio says. \u201cThis has happened before. Reagan did that in 1980.\u201d ", " In summing up the ideological, demographic and economic shifts in America, the senator suggests he\u2019s most certain about the speed of change in society and elections. ", " \u201cWhatever\u2019s going to happen is going to happen faster than it has ever happened before. It used to take a decade or numerous elections to change these sorts of things? Why?\u201d ", " A student points out that, in the old days, \u201cthe news would come slower.\u201d ", " \u201cRight. Now it\u2019s all real time. It\u2019s all real time,\u201d Rubio responds. \u201cSo if someone wants to go out and promote this sort of agenda and move people on it, they can do it very quickly.\u201d ", " Asked after class if he\u2019s the person who would promote the \u201cagenda\u201d he laid out as a presidential candidate, the once-effusive Rubio grew more measured. ", " \u201cI might. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision I\u2019ll have to make.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

It was within that industry that Brock first developed a career.

He later did reporting that first introduced America to the name Paula Jones, the woman who, in the scandal known as Troopergate, accused Bill Clinton of harassment during his days in Arkansas, where he served as governor.

He intended the book as a hit piece, but the project converted him instead to a Clinton supporter, and soon he publicly disavowed his earlier attacks on the pair. ", " Brock declined to discuss his relationship with the former president or the former secretary of state, who lost out on the White House to Barack Obama in 2008. Yet his appearance in Little Rock on Tuesday is further evidence of how far inside their orbit he has traveled since becoming an ally after Bill Clinton left office. He is known to have close ties to some top Clinton aides and donors. ", " ( ", ") ", " The invitation to speak at the school came about two or three months ago, Brock said. The school has hosted a number of people who are ideologically unlike the Clintons \u2014 such as GOP strategist Karl Rove, lawyer Ben Ginsberg and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee \u2014 but Brock represents something unique. ", " \u201cIn the Clinton world, David Brock in the \u201990s was a household name that was certainly one that people knew was not engaged in friendly fire,\u201d said Skip Rutherford, the dean of the Clinton School of Public Service, who was spotted having a drink with Brock and Clinton Foundation board chairman Bruce Lindsey on Monday night. \u201cRegardless of how you feel, [his evolution] is a story in and of its own right.\u201d ", " In the interview with POLITICO, Brock said his own research eventually changed his mind about the Clintons. ", " \u201cWhat led to my change of views about the Clintons was working through the research and writing on the book on Hillary,\u201d he said of the 1997 book, which other conservatives viewed as treating the then-first lady too gently. \u201cAnd I went into that with a very negative agenda and after doing all the work on it for a couple of years I came out of it with a much more positive view of her, and so the transition \u2026 really worked itself out through that book.\u201d ", " ( ", ") ", " After \"The Seduction of Hillary Rodham\" was published, Brock wrote an apologia in Esquire magazine, saying he was finished with the career he\u2019d led in the 1990s. A year later, he wrote a follow-up piece apologizing to Clinton (he ultimately did the same with Anita Hill). ", " In 2004, Brock founded Media Matters, which aimed to serve as a counterweight to conservative media infrastructure, with Fox News being a top target. He has also founded the research-focused super PAC American Bridge, which has grown from a fledgling operation in 2010 into a sophisticated opposition arm. Its offshoot project, Correct the Record, has moved to claim a social media space defending Hillary Clinton as she weighs a second presidential campaign. ", " The former secretary of state claimed ownership of Media Matters in August 2007, telling the YearlyKos Convention that she was a part of a new \u201cprogressive infrastructure \u2014 institutions that I helped to start and support like Media Matters and Center for American Progress.\u201d ", " Brock\u2019s Clintonland ties now run deep.

", " But the free-agent entities can also become headaches when they act at cross-purposes \u2014 or in ways a candidate doesn\u2019t approve of. ", " ", " ", " The call to Abedin, described by several people familiar with the conversation, touched off a larger debate in Clinton\u2019s circle. Clinton herself was forced to grapple with the run-in between the two groups; several sources familiar with the discussions said she wanted to keep her team distant from the work of the super PACs to avoid brushing up against rules forbidding coordination. But Clinton made clear to aides that the mess, which in many ways echoed the factionalism of her past, needed to be sorted out. ", " In a series of meetings in Washington and New York, advisers to both groups huddled to address the problem. John Podesta, the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton who recently joined the Obama White House, was among the participants brought in on the Priorities side to help. ", " Some suggested trying to force Ready for Hillary to shut down. That idea was rejected out of concern it would prompt negative stories about Clinton forces stomping on the grass roots. ", " Another adviser proposed merging the two super PACs, but that also went nowhere. ", " ( ", ") ", " Eventually they settled on a solution: Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data, accepting donations up to $25,000. Priorities would be the super PAC for mega-donors, working solely on paid advertising. ", " Ready for Hillary has since won over key people close to Clinton impressed by its efforts like cultivating detailed lists of supporters through social media, which Clinton didn\u2019t do in 2008. Among other moves, it brought on Craig Smith, a White House political director for Bill Clinton and friend from his Arkansas days. He gave the aura of an adult in the room to a group created by younger former Clinton staffers. ", " Most important is that Moore, whose background is in field organizing, is said to believe in the work the group is doing, as does Baker of Dewey Square, according to several sources. Besides the email list, Ready for Hillary is building a massive, 50-state direct-mail and voter targeting program. In a sign of cooperation, the group rented Clinton\u2019s supporter list from her old PAC. It also brought on Obama\u2019s field gurus, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, to help build up its efforts, including by supporting local candidates who Clinton backs in this year\u2019s midterm elections. ", " Ready for Hillary hopes to make its data available to a 2016 Clinton campaign, and some Clinton allies believe there are a number of young aides and operatives working for the super PAC who could become part of her campaign. The 2008 campaign had many well-documented flaws, but one was the failure to prominently deploy young campaign talent, which flocked to Obama. ", " \u201cIf you wonder whether Clintonworld has learned our lessons from 2008, look no further than the work of Ready for Hillary,\u201d said one source supportive of its work. ", " It\u2019s far from certain the outside group\u2019s voter data would be welcomed by a Clinton campaign; it will likely prefer to compile its own. Or, some Clinton associates say, it could choose from any number of outside campaign data firms, including two launched by Obama 2012 veterans after his reelection. ", " Elsewhere in the constellation of outside groups doing work related to Clinton is EMILY\u2019s List, led by operative Stephanie Schriock, who is frequently mentioned as a possible Clinton campaign manager. The group, which focuses on electing women and isn\u2019t a super PAC, is conducting an expansive polling project about attitudes toward female candidates. Correct the Record, the Brock-sponsored rapid response project, is being managed by a Hillary Clinton favorite, Burns Strider, and has her allies\u2019 nod of approval. ", " \u201cThis effort for Hillary, unprecedented in both its early timing and scope, is a demonstration of the extent to which the Democratic Party is unified behind this potential candidacy,\u201d said one of the organizers. ", " ", " ", " Two of the boldest-faced names to enter the Clinton constellation in 2013 tied their political fortunes to electing Obama in 2008: Jim Messina, who went on to become a top political hand in the White House and then run Obama\u2019s reelection, and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg. ", " ( ", ") ", " Despite his late arrival to Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008 \u2014 he didn\u2019t come on board until after the bloody primary \u2014 Messina was seen by Clinton aides as carrying a deep grudge from the campaign to the White House. Some Clinton associates suspected he was behind a failed attempt to scuttle two of her top staff picks at State: Capricia Marshall and Philippe Reines. ", " But what Messina lacks in longtime loyalty to Clinton, he makes up for in connections to Obama\u2019s vast network of donors and activists. That had obvious value to a group like Priorities USA, which early last year was looking to morph from its 2012 version that decimated Mitt Romney with a series of attack ads into a pro-Clinton endeavor for 2016. ", " Early last year, Messina, who quietly admired Priorities\u2019 work in 2012, started talking informally to the super PAC about a role. One draw is that working on a super PAC is less of a grind, and certainly more lucrative, than an actual campaign. ", " The discussions went on for months last year, long before news reports in November that he was in serious talks to become a co-chairman of the group. But some Clinton allies have grumbled that Messina\u2019s swelling list of business clients could potentially embarrass Clinton; his backers dismiss the complaints as professional jealousy, saying plenty of Clinton advisers have their own potential business conflicts. ", " ( ", ") ", " The White House has its own worries about Messina\u2019s hoped-for move. One is that it would look like Obama was giving his blessing to the pro-Clinton group as his own vice president, Joe Biden, is weighing a 2016 run. Concern within the administration about ruffling relations with Biden has been serious enough to cause a lengthy delay in signing off on Messina officially joining Priorities, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. ", " Whatever role Messina may end up playing in 2016, the mere fact that most Clinton allies are fine with him being part of a pro-Clinton group signals a rapprochement that began when Obama tapped Clinton as his top diplomat. Messina had informal discussions with some of her aides after 2012 about his view of modern campaigns, and Bill Clinton has publicly admired his work since developing a connection with him last year. ", " Messina wasn\u2019t the only one affiliated with Obama to join the future Clinton army via Priorities. Katzenberg broke with the Clintons in 2008 to back Obama and four years later helped launch Priorities with a $2 million check. ", " \u201cI hope my donation will draw attention to the amount of money being raised by the extreme right wing and serve as a catalyst for other Democratic donors,\u201d the DreamWorks Animation chief executive told CBS News in April 2012. The super PAC is now broadly seen as his baby. ", " After Obama secured four more years, the Democratic rainmaker made clear he was prepared to get behind Clinton financially. With Priorities reinventing itself and Messina getting involved with the group \u2014 Katzenberg and Messina worked together during the 2012 race \u2014 the media mogul has positioned himself as the group\u2019s ambassador to Hollywood. ", " If all goes as planned, the hope is that Katzenberg and Messina\u2019s involvement on behalf of Clinton will signal a smooth passage from Obama to Clinton within the party. ", " \u201cIt reflects the fact that the Obama political infrastructure is seamlessly transitioning to serve as [Clinton\u2019s] political infrastructure,\u201d said California-based political strategist Chris Lehane. \u201cAnd [it] sends a signal to both Obama donors and operatives that it is all right to begin actively supporting the Clinton \u201916 effort.\u201d ", " ", " ", " Despite the feverish buildup to a Clinton candidacy, some of her closest advisers aren\u2019t sure she\u2019ll run \u00ad\u2014 and some don\u2019t want her to. ", " Clinton has as clear a path to the nomination as anyone could. But she also bears the scars from her 2008 battle, as do a number of her aides who remember vividly the toll the enterprise took on Clinton and everyone involved. They all want to help her achieve whatever she decides she wants, but they are clear-eyed about another campaign. ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

But none might be endorsed by the state\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Scott. ", " When will he endorse, and who will it be? Scott won\u2019t say. But the governor is personally close to two potential contenders who have no personal ties to Florida: former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, both of whom attended Scott\u2019s second-term inauguration in January. ", "Story Continued Below", " What Scott\u2019s actions have made clear, however, is that he\u2019s starting to raise his profile nationally. At the same time, the once-unpopular governor is repairing some damaged relations with fellow Republicans in Florida. ", " By announcing he\u2019ll likely endorse in the primary, Scott began to reinsert himself in the political dialogue of the nation\u2019s most important swing state just as it\u2019s receiving a disproportionate amount of attention due to the depth of the GOP\u2019s bench of potential candidates: former Gov. Jeb Bush (a Coral Gables resident); Sen. Marco Rubio (West Miami); former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (Walton County); and Dr. Ben Carson (West Palm Beach). ", " and ", " Scott\u2019s decision to involve himself in the primary contrasts with his decision to stay out of the Republican race in 2012. He wouldn\u2019t say what has changed or what\u2019s next. ", " \u201cWe\u2019ll see what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Scott told POLITICO when asked when and why he\u2019d endorse in the primary. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what I want: I want somebody who\u2019s going to focus on the economy. They have to limit the growth of the federal government. They\u2019ve got to cut taxes and regulation \u2014 basically, what we\u2019ve done. And we need somebody who\u2019s going to fight ISIS. And then we still have to deal with health care.\u201d ", " Aside from positioning himself as a potential primary player, Scott is extending his national footprint by traveling to Democrat-run states to persuade businesses to move to low-tax Florida. Scott made Pennsylvania the target of his first \u201cdomestic trade mission.\u201d California\u2019s likely next. ", " And on Wednesday morning, Scott timed an Obamacare-bashing op-ed he wrote for POLITICO to coincide with the U.S. Supreme Court hearings over federal health-insurance subsidies. ", " Back home, as the Florida Legislature began its 60-day lawmaking session Tuesday, Scott became the first sitting governor to embark on a paid media campaign to advocate his policies. Last week, he began meeting with a handful of lobbyists at a Tallahassee hotel, where he asked them to bundle as much as $250,000 each for his upcoming ad buy. ", " The flurry of activity by Scott in and out of Florida has been dismissed as public-relations stunts, praised as visionary or shrugged off as inconsequential. ", " Scott\u2019s poll numbers are poor when compared to those of the two most-popular Republicans in the state, Bush and Rubio, who stand to gain relatively little from an endorsement. Rubio\u2019s and Bush\u2019s camps, however, say the men appreciate and respect the governor. Others think differently. ", " \u201cNot only do they not really want Scott\u2019s endorsement, they don\u2019t need it,\u201d said Chris Ingram, a Republican consultant and political commentator from Tampa. ", " \u201cIt might have some effect if Scott endorses someone other than Bush or Rubio,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cBut it would be seen as completely disloyal.\u201d ", " It could also be awkward. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera is a close family friend of Rubio\u2019s and is likely to support the senator when he officially signals he\u2019s running for the White House, likely in April. ", " Florida is a high-priority target for Republicans nationally because without the state\u2019s 29 Electoral College votes, the GOP probably can\u2019t win the White House. The state was even more important in the previous two presidential cycles, when Florida became an early primary state. This year, the Legislature plans a winner-take-all primary March 15, 2016 \u2014 a move designed to make the state an attractive place to campaign. ", " It also could ensure that more candidates, especially those from out of state, court Scott. ", " A political outsider who owes little to the state GOP\u2019s establishment, Scott is probably closest to Perry and Christie. Both men sat in the front row at Scott\u2019s inaugural this year. Neither Bush nor Rubio showed, though they cut ads for Scott during his 2014 campaign. ", " Scott and his political team owe a debt of gratitude to Christie, the Republican Governors Association chairman who steered about $18.5 million to Scott\u2019s reelection campaign in 2014. Scott barely won, beating Democrat Charlie Crist by just 1.08 percentage points. And though Christie has a reputation for being abrasive, Scott\u2019s election team says he was a pleasure to deal with. ", " Scott\u2019s friendship with Perry is so close \u2014 they\u2019ve gone fishing together \u2014 it\u2019s described in the state capital as a \u201cbromance.\u201d ", " Perry was the first GOP governor to start hitting up Democrat-run states to poach business. Last year, Perry traveled to New York, pitched Texas as business-friendly and challenged the Empire State\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, to a debate. Cuomo declined. The volume of news coverage from Perry\u2019s New York jaunt underscored the public-relations value of such domestic trade missions. After Perry left office in January, Scott started to fill the void. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly smart move for the governor to be picking up the baton from Rick Perry,\u201d said David Bossie, president and chairman of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. ", " \u201cRaising his national profile as a business-savvy governor, which reinforces why he was elected and reelected governor of Florida in the first place, is an incredibly smart move for Rick Scott because there are companies in these states that feel like they\u2019re stuck,\u201d Bossie said. ", " Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s office blasted Scott for his trip to the Keystone State last month. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s a political stunt,\u201d a Wolf spokesman told The Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cThe stagnant economy we inherited is not our doing, yet he didn\u2019t come under our predecessor.\u201d ", " In Florida, Democratic state Rep. Jos\u00e9 Javier Rodriguez of Miami said the effort \u201csounds strange to me. Unstatesmanlike.\u201d ", " But Scott says he\u2019s just fulfilling a campaign promise to bring jobs to Florida. And, he says, it\u2019s time to let the rest of the nation know about it. ", " \u201cI know what I care about,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNow we have a track record. It\u2019s worked in our state. And it looks like that\u2019s what the other states ought to do. It makes it easy when you have a governor up in Pennsylvania who\u2019s raising taxes. So I\u2019ll be recruiting companies from around the country because you\u2019re still going to see people raising taxes and increase regulation. I\u2019m going to get them here.\u201d ", " But Scott also has problems at home. ", " He has had strained relations with the GOP-led Legislature. Late last year, the statewide elected members of the Florida Cabinet, all Republicans, became upset after Scott\u2019s former chief counsel forced the resignation of the state\u2019s popular Department of Law Enforcement chief, Gerald Bailey. The Cabinet members, who oversee the law-enforcement post with the governor, say the forced resignation was made without their knowledge or approval. ", " Scott eventually apologized. But in the interim, the governor\u2019s handpicked Republican Party of Florida chairwoman lost her reelection \u2014 a sign that party voters had had enough of Scott. During the chairwoman\u2019s race, the governor unexpectedly transferred $580,000 from Republican Party coffers to Scott\u2019s political committee, Let\u2019s Get to Work. ", " In early March, Let\u2019s Get to Work announced it would soon use the money to make a statewide ad buy to advocate the governor\u2019s budget priorities \u2014 a rare move for a sitting governor whose party controls both houses of the Legislature, where members are raising questions about the level of tax cuts and schools spending Scott wants for next year\u2019s budget. ", " Some lawmakers say the ad campaign is an indicator of Scott\u2019s political infirmity. ", " \u201cThe threat of the governor\u2019s veto pen is small, and his bullhorn is the size of a thimble,\u201d said one top Republican in the Legislature. ", " Still, the governor can strike out millions in hometown spending projects from legislators, which is why they\u2019re reluctant to publicly criticize him. ", " \u201cTestosterone is always at its highest right before session,\u201d Florida political consultant Randy Nielsen said. \u201cThe fact is, Rick Scott has his own airplane, the veto pen and he\u2019s governor. He\u2019s not weak at all.\u201d ", " Still, Scott is seeking to build more support in the party and the Legislature as he extends himself nationally. For the past few weeks, Scott and the lieutenant governor have had private meals with Republican lawmakers.

Nancy Detert, a Venice Republican who recently dined at the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cI think he\u2019s starting to get a clue that he needs us all together.\u201d ", " But, a number of lawmakers say, Scott could undo some of that goodwill if he bucks state lawmakers and endorses a candidate other than Rubio or Bush. ", " \u201cThis is a Jeb town, and those who aren\u2019t with Jeb are with Marco, and vice versa,\u201d said a Bush-backing Republican legislator who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cA Florida Republican governor who doesn\u2019t endorse one of them is going to lose a lot of respect here.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " All before he\u2019s even given his maiden speech on the Senate floor. ", " Cotton has gained prominence with a disciplined adherence to talking points on television and the campaign trail. He easily ousted former Sen. Mark Pryor last year, a centrist Democrat from Arkansas political royalty, in one of the most hard-fought and expensive Senate races in the country. With his letter and a few headline-grabbing speeches in his Senate committees, Cotton is showing that driving a message can be just as important to building a profile in the Senate as amassing bipartisan support for legislation.

Instead, Cotton chose a spate of cable TV interviews and an interview with The Wall Street Journal to push his message this week. ", " The youngest senator in the chamber at 37, Cotton has emerged as a leader of the next generation of GOP hawks. His ascent comes amid internal party battles over foreign policy that appeared to give increased influence to the non-interventionist policies embodied by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). With support from the conservative wing of the party as well as leadership, Cotton has risen from the House to Senate in two years and is seen by some Republicans as an eventual White House contender.

Bobby Jindal. He is one of a dozen GOP freshmen, leading a class that\u2019s more hawkish than the one the 2010 tea party wave ushered in.

At a Senate Banking Committee hearing in January, he tried to make an Iran sanctions bill more strict and said he had little patience for Obama\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, admitting weeks before his Iran letter was released that he\u2019d prefer that talks fall apart.

As far as I\u2019m concerned, every last one of them can rot in hell. But as long as they don\u2019t do that, they can rot in Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\u201d ", " Though Cotton\u2019s letter has revealed internal GOP divisions between those who signed the letter and those who did not, there was little dissension during the party\u2019s private lunch on Tuesday, sources said. The only concern that senators discussed was caution moving forward on Iran so as not to further alienate Democratic hawks when it finally comes time to vote on an Iran bill sometime in early April.

But Washington was socked by a snowstorm, a Senate session was scuttled and the weekend came. ", " Cotton used that time to work the phones.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an aspiring presidential candidate who will run with a vigorous foreign policy platform, was having second thoughts after initially declining to sign on.

But it wasn\u2019t a purely environmental approach, either. The restoration plan that Bush supported was not just about the Everglades. It was also about flood control and water supply for the residents and businesses that share South Florida with the Everglades and depend on aquifers underneath the Everglades. He shepherded the Army Corps of Engineers plan to re-engineer and replumb the ravaged watershed through the Florida legislature without a single dissenting vote, and despite his tightfisted reputation, he spent lavishly to get it started.

And it wasn\u2019t lost on the former secretary of state\u2019s camp: one Clinton confidante told POLITICO the scrutiny of the past week convinced Clinton to speed up the campaign rollout. The internal discussions about delaying the kickoff until July are ancient history; Clinton\u2019s announcement is now expected within the next two to five weeks. ", " \u201cSecretary Clinton had to address the issue and the sooner she did, the sooner this issue will be resolved, or at least take up less of the media\u2019s attention,\u201d said Bret Nilles, chairman of Iowa\u2019s Linn County Democrats, in an email. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that this might accelerate her thinking in declaring her intentions. This seems like the first step on getting her side of the story out to the public directly.\u201d ", " \u201cWhen she announces that she\u2019s running, that\u2019s when this will fade away,\u201d added a national Democratic strategist familiar with the emerging campaign structure and plans. ", " Clinton dug in her heels during Tuesday\u2019s 20-minute news conference at United Nations headquarters, insisting that she followed protocol while relying on her personal email address \u2014 which runs on a server sitting in her Chappaqua, New York, mansion \u2014 for her work in the State Department from 2009 to 2013. But the media and Republicans alike panned her performance, which came after a week of intense scrutiny and relative silence from the presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner. ", " Allies and aides have continued to aggressively defend Clinton, who remains the overwhelming favorite for her party\u2019s nomination \u2014 no other Democrat seems poised to mount a serious challenge. Her backers maintain that Clinton\u2019s transfer of 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department reflects her commitment to accountability and that ordinary voters will not care about this issue \u2014 especially not on Election Day in November 2016. Republican attempts to paint Clinton as opaque and cagey will fail, they say, since there are few figures in the world who are better-known to voters than Clinton.

Instead, they\u2019ve tended to emphasize that the party should have a competitive primary so that she is better prepared for the general election. ", " Most Democrats said on Tuesday that Clinton would emerge safely from the news conference and the email scandal, but some were still wary of the optics and circumstances. ", " \u201cYou\u2019re secretary of state for the United States!\u201d exclaimed former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder. \u201cThat\u2019s not a personal account. It\u2019s not a matter of being smarter, it would have been the right thing to do. Don\u2019t try to justify it.\u201d ", " Still, the overwhelming feeling in Democratic circles was one of relief that Clinton had finally addressed the questions \u2014 thereby quashing the Republican talking point that she has been \u201chiding\u201d \u2014 and that she did not stand down. ", " \u201cThis will help speed the end of this [controversy],\u201d said Iowa Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald. \u201cI think she could have done this earlier, and it wouldn\u2019t have gotten so out of hand.\u201d ", " Allies said the format, a packed event with dozens of reporters and television cameras, suited the situation well. ", " Even so, the defensive news conference \u2014 Clinton\u2019s first in years \u2014 effectively signaled the beginning of her still-undeclared campaign. ", " It was not the bang Clinton was hoping for when she and her team carefully designed her March schedule to focus on her work on women\u2019s equality and rights, and her overall message \u2014 that women and girls have come a long way, yet more work is to be done \u2014 has been largely drowned out. Clinton, who is expected to lean on her potential status as the first female president in 2016, was at the U.N. for a speech commemorating the 20th anniversary of her famous 1995 address on women\u2019s progress in Beijing. ", " Now, however, Democrats are clamoring for Clinton to drop the pretense and acknowledge her White House aspirations. Without a political team in place, Clinton\u2019s small personal staff and a network of loosely affiliated outside groups have carried the burden of responding to the deluge of questions. As a candidate with a full-scale campaign, Clinton could more easily direct and coordinate a robust response. ", "POLITICO MAGAZINE", " \u201cThat would be helpful,\u201d said South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison. \u201cIn terms of her own operation, it [would give] her the ability to address these issues.\u201d ", " Even while Clinton stumbles, there was little talk of her potential challengers on Tuesday. The three most active \u2014 former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb \u2014 declined to jab at Clinton over the controversy. ", " \u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about Hillary Clinton,\u201d Sanders told reporters in Washington.

", " \u201cUltimately, a press conference is not going to put this to rest, because Republicans have made it clear that they want to make this a witch hunt,\u201d said the Democrat close to Clinton\u2019s nascent campaign who expects the issue to recede in importance once Clinton declares her candidacy.

", "Story Continued Below", " It was all in keeping with the defiant, business-as-usual approach the New Jersey Democrat has maintained since news leaked Friday that the Justice Department was preparing to charge him with illegally aiding a political benefactor and longtime friend, Salomon Melgen. With his career and future suddenly in jeopardy, Menendez has vowed to keep his Senate seat. He refuses to say if he\u2019d give up his leadership post in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee if he\u2019s indicted. ", " And in an interview with POLITICO on Tuesday, Menendez jabbed the DOJ for recent leaks that his allies have said were clearly intended to undermine him. Federal law enforcement officials have said privately that they expect a grand jury in New Jersey to indict Menendez in the next few weeks, with his dealings with Melgen at the center of the case. ", " \u201cAll I can say is leaks are in violation of the law,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cAnd I hope there is an investigation as to however, whomever is conducting such leaks.\u201d ", " Menendez\u2019s survival strategy has been a mix of public defiance and an inside game that has helped solidify support within the Democratic Caucus \u2014 and even with Melgen himself. ", " Menendez is relying on his close ties to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to protect his committee spot, at least before any indictment. He\u2019s also gotten support from Republicans, who back his opposition to the Obama administration over Iran and Cuba and view the leaks as an attempt by the White House to silence him. ", " And Menendez has emphasized \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that Melgen has been a close friend for years, and that their two families have spent holidays together, attended the same family weddings and funerals and exchanged presents during special occasions. Such comments could help persuade Melgen to not cooperate with federal officials in their case against Menendez. So far, that approach seems to be working. ", " Anne Lyons, Melgen\u2019s Miami-based attorney, said her client is not cooperating with federal prosecutors, as Menendez and his supporters had feared. ", " \u201cI don\u2019t know why people keep saying that to us, but no, he\u2019s not,\u201d Lyons said on Tuesday. Lyons declined to discuss the case any further. ", " Even so, Menendez is trapped by circumstances, at least until he knows what charges he faces. That may not change for weeks or even months, but for now, he\u2019s prepared to battle the charges tooth and nail. ", " \u201cObviously, if the Justice Department proceeds, it will mean a long, drawn-out process, and the senator will have to deal with that,\u201d said a source close to Menendez. \u201cBut he\u2019s already been dealing with this investigation, and the leaks along the way, for two years. He has no choice but to continue to go about his job as the legal process plays out, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d ", " Inside the Capitol, his strategy seems to be working as well. Democrats are avoiding the topic in public comments and even in private settings. In their first caucus gathering since last week\u2019s news broke, Democrats attending Tuesday\u2019s lunch in the Senate\u2019s Lyndon B. Johnson Room didn\u2019t bring up Menendez\u2019s expected corruption charges, attendees said. And Reid, who has a long relationship with Menendez and is known to show fierce loyalty to his allies, refused to distance himself from the New Jersey Democrat. ", " \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what happens,\u201d Reid said when asked about the issue. When pressed by reporters on whether Menendez should give up his post on the Foreign Relations Committee, Reid responded that \u201cSen. Menendez has done a stalwart job as the chair of the committee, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s been an outstanding senator.\u201d ", " And when asked why Democrats don\u2019t have their own formal rules to remove indicted senators from top committee posts, as Republicans do, Reid simply shrugged and moved on. ", " \u201cBeats me,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d ", " DOJ investigators are examining whether Menendez illegally took official action to benefit Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who is one of his biggest donors. Federal investigators have been probing the case for more than two years, even interviewing ", " and former Health and Human Services Secretary ", " about a meeting she had in August 2012 with Menendez on a dispute affecting Melgen\u2019s business. ", " In an interview Monday, Sebelius said it was clear that the meeting was aimed at discussing Menendez\u2019s concerns about policies affecting Melgen\u2019s business, a charge Menendez\u2019s office denies. ", " \u201cWe were told the topic would be billing issues with Dr. Melgen,\u201d Sebelius said, saying she consulted with HHS attorneys before the session \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to open the door to any inappropriate discussion.\u201d ", " On Tuesday, Menendez continued to dig in when asked if he\u2019d step down as ranking Democrat on Foreign Relations if the indictment comes, as expected. (Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin would probably be next in line to replace Menendez as the committee\u2019s ranking member.) ", " \u201cYour question is based on supposition,\u201d Menendez said, noting that he has not been charged with any wrongdoing at this point. \u201cAnd I am not going to engage in supposition.\u201d ", " A number of his Democratic colleagues aren\u2019t eager to pry into the details involving Menendez\u2019s case. The less they know, Democrats privately say, the easier it is to avoid questions about his future. ", " \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to let the facts play out at this point,\u201d said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, No. 4 in her party leadership. ", " \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until the situation evolves further,\u201d added Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. ", " Democrats serving on Foreign Relations were equally cautious. ", " \u201cI just think it\u2019s way too premature to be talking about this,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. \u201cAll we have is a cable news report. We\u2019ll cross bridges when they come up in our path.\u201d ", " Murphy added: \u201cBob is a really strong voice in our caucus, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change no matter what happens over the next few weeks.\u201d ", " Yet even as he has emerged at the center of a growing scandal, Menendez has found some unlikely support from Republicans. A number of conservatives, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have questioned whether the case has been motivated by Menendez\u2019s high-profile role pushing back on the administration\u2019s Iran and Cuba policies. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he and Menendez have had multiple conversations over the committee\u2019s agenda, suggesting the Democrat is carrying on with his business as if he\u2019s not in legal jeopardy. ", " \u201cI have had two conversations with him in the last 24 hours \u2014 all of which were about policy issues that we need to deal with,\u201d the Tennessee Republican said. ", " Asked Tuesday if he would continue his outspoken criticism of the administration\u2019s foreign policies, Menendez said: \u201cI am going to be supportive when they do something positive, and when I don\u2019t agree, I am going to be a critic.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Bush White House. \n ", " ", " But, Fleischer adds, there are some signs of a philosophy: \u201cIt seems as if he will come out of the more muscular peace-through-strength wing of the party,\u201d Fleischer said. \n ", " ", " Indeed, some of Bush\u2019s most important allies within the GOP foreign policy establishment are closely associated with his brother, whose name is almost synonymous with a war in Iraq that most Americans call a mistake. \n ", " ", " Jeb Bush\u2019s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is a board member of an education foundation Bush chairs, and with whom he is personally close. And soon after leaving office in 2009, Cheney, who cares most about national security, told Fox News that he is \u201ca big fan of Jeb\u2019s.\u201d Bush has also impressed one of the GOP\u2019s wealthiest donors, the hawkish casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. \n ", " ", " Conservative foreign policy insiders say that what\u2019s known about Bush\u2019s views places him in the dominant interventionist wing of his party, which is still shaped by his co-signatories on the 1997 Project for the New American Century document. He has challenged the anti-interventionist views of Sen. Rand Paul and his supporters. \n ", " ", " But those conservatives also note that while Jeb\u2019s brother, George W., is remembered for a controversially bold foreign policy, his father, former President George H.W. Bush, charted a more pragmatic approach.

In April 2006, Bush joined three other governors to visit U.S. troops in Iraq, where he called progress in the country \u201cundeniable,\u201d even as Iraq descended into civil war. \n ", " ", " Jeb Bush\u2019s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. | AP Photo ", "\n  ", " ", " Yet Bush qualified his support for the endeavor, adding: \u201cIn a mission this ambitious, and this extensive, is it possible that mistakes were made? Of course, it is.

But in some sense, he has more running room because of that \u2014 he can offer criticisms without being accused of disloyalty,\u201d Feaver added. \n ", " ", " For the moment, Bush has refrained from analyzing his own party and stuck to attacks on President Barack Obama. He has mocked Obama\u2019s so-called leading from behind strategy and called for a stronger U.S. alliance with Israel and a tougher stance on Iran. All were familiar talking points in Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. \n ", " ", " Bush sounded similar themes in a March address to a meeting of Adelson\u2019s Republican Jewish Coalition, where he assailed Obama as passive and warned conservatives against the temptation of withdrawal from the world. Bush also met privately with Adelson and satisfied him on the issue he and his wife hold most dear. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe Adelsons are confident that Jeb Bush is an advocate for Israel,\u201d says a source close to the couple. \n ", " ", " More recently, in a Dec. 2 speech to a Florida group that backs democracy in Cuba, Bush said Obama has \u201cretrenched\u201d abroad, with dangerous consequences. \n ", " ", " \u201cIn this unstable and uncertain world, the United States has actually played a part in creating greater instability and greater unraveling,\u201d Bush told the U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC. \n ", " ", " Bush did offer one kind word for the president. \u201cThankfully, I think he\u2019s seen the light in Afghanistan,\u201d Bush said, an apparent reference to Obama\u2019s recent extension of some U.S. combat operations there. But he added that withdrawing troops from the country \u201csimply because it is politically expedient is the wrong thing to do.\u201d \n ", " ", " In the same remarks, Bush suggested that a hasty exit created the current crisis in Iraq. Some Republicans think the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant offers Bush a potent comeback against assaults on his brother\u2019s legacy. \n ", " ", " And they note that the most likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, will be constrained in her discussion of Iraq by her 2002 Senate vote to authorize military force against Saddam\u2019s regime. \n ", " ", " Even so, Democrats would be sure to hang Jeb Bush\u2019s brother\u2019s unpopular foreign policy legacy around his neck.

He addressed the question on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in March 2013. \n ", " ", " \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any Bush baggage at all,\u201d he said. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

He said it also took political skill to convince a Republican-dominated legislature, mostly with members from far outside Detroit, to put up state money as part of the deal to exit bankruptcy. Snyder even got foundations and philanthropists to chip in to save the city\u2019s art museum from being forced to auction off its collection.

", " Schauer tried very hard to attack the governor over the bankruptcy during the campaign, saying he was short-changing retiree pensions and usurping democracy. Snyder, an unabashed technocrat, got agitated about some of these attacks during their only debate. ", " The Republican prides himself on being a numbers guy who cares first and foremost about the bottom line, but members of both parties agree he\u2019s gotten better at expressing empathy since taking office in 2011. On Wednesday, Snyder expressed gratitude several times to the retirees and city employees who have made \u201csacrifices\u201d for the greater good of Detroit.

Once upon a time, in the era before email and whose \u201cserver\u201d was whose, it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue at all: Dean Acheson, for instance, lived in no fear that the public would have access to his personal letters musing about the intentions of Stalin or the presence of possible Soviet spies in the State Department alleged by Joe McCarthy, or any number of other matters of state. Long before that, presidents in particular were free to keep or dispose of their papers as they saw fit; one obscure president, Chester Arthur, sealed his obscurity by instructing his family to burn his papers after his death. ", " And that was a rule of thumb for anyone in the old days: You could decide on your own what was public and private, and what you wanted to keep and what you wanted to destroy. ", "Story Continued Below", " It is only in the last few decades that our entire understanding of what is public and what is private, who controls information, who owns it and who has a right to it, has become deeply and destructively muddled. Clinton\u2019s attempt to carve out some sphere of privacy stems directly from a political culture that has seemingly managed the worst of all possible worlds: a fetish to classify as much as possible on the one hand, and on the other a surveillance and gotcha culture that seeks to make the keeping of secrets impossible. ", " One problem is that government protocols about e-mail and instant message retention have evolved much more slowly than the technologies have. What\u2019s more, there used to be a bright line between personal and public papers, or between official and unofficial correspondence, with it fully understood and unquestioned that high officials could and would maintain a considerable corpus that they and they alone would control, own and determine access to. ", " The watershed here, as in so much else in contemporary politics, was Watergate. That scandal shed light on what had been common practice, namely for presidents and high officials to keep separate public and private records. Before Watergate the public records would be retained by the government, but the private records were treated the same as the papers and diaries of any private citizen\u2014one reason why so many personal and professional records from the 19th\u00a0century have been lost. It was understood that even public servants have a legitimate sphere of privacy. ", " Presidents and officials throughout the 19th\u00a0and early 20th\u00a0century tended to be voluminous letter writers. That, after all, was how most communication occurred, other than face-to-face meetings. It is why the papers of Thomas Jefferson include more than 18,000 letters. Presidents and officials often meticulously kept their records, wanting to maintain an archive for that fuzzy muse \u201cposterity.\u201d But, and this is crucial, there was little notion that the public however defined had a right to read those letters, except those written purely in an official capacity. ", " Since the 1970s, however, the abuse of that privacy, along with abuses of executive authority, led to the ", ", which created a clearer distinction between public and private records. Much of that stemmed from President Nixon\u2019s attempt to forestall requests for documents about the Watergate affair, and for tape recordings, on the principle that they were his private papers and recordings to dispose of as he saw fit. The Presidential Records Act sat side by side with the earlier Federal Records Act, which established guidelines for how government agencies were to archive their material and turn it over to the National Archives. All of these laws were passed when records were kept primarily on paper, with some notable exceptions such as that audio recording system installed the Oval Office. All of these laws exempt some national security communications from release on a case-by-case basis, as well as certain communications between a president and his advisers, and the same pertains to other high officials. None of these laws covered what has become the primary means of communications: email. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", " Meanwhile, the post-Watergate culture of Washington and of the press led to a near-continuous culture of scandal, which not a single president has been immune to. Reagan and Iran-Contra, George H.W. Bush and Iraqgate, the Clintons from Whitewater to Monicagate, George W. Bush about yellow-cake and intelligence, the Obama administration from IRS investigations to Benghazi and Fast and Furious.

John McCain and Lindsey Graham \u2014 were working with senators from both parties to draft an immigration bill, top Rubio hands flatly warned the Florida freshman not to go there. The advisers feared nothing would be worse for his chances in a potential presidential campaign than being associated with \u201camnesty\u201d for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. ", " Rubio didn\u2019t take the advice. And two years later, immigration remains the freshman senator\u2019s No. 1 liability in his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination \u2014 though not necessarily the deal breaker it appeared to be after the reform effort Rubio helped shepherd to passage in the Senate hit a brick wall in the House. ", " \u201cEverybody likes Marco Rubio,\u201d said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated commentator. But \u201cI still don\u2019t hear his name from conservatives at all, and I think the Gang of Eight\u201d \u2014 the bipartisan group of senators that pushed the most sweeping immigration overhaul in a generation \u2014 \u201chas a lot to do with that.\u201d ", " Even so, the political damage to Rubio has clearly subsided over time, in no small part due to Rubio\u2019s repeated disavowal of the entire reform exercise. In the days ahead of his presidential campaign launch in Miami Monday evening, some critics on the tea party right concede he has resuscitated himself politically, though the true effect may not be apparent until much deeper into the 2016 primary season. ", " \u201cWhat I think everyone over here underestimated is how difficult it is to pass massive pieces of legislation on any subject \u2014 not just immigration \u2014 given the rightful distrust the people have about the federal government,\u201d Rubio said in a recent interview in the Capitol. ", " Said Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots: \u201cI think that Sen.

I think that neutralizes his mistakes.\u201d ", " Still, even if immigration won\u2019t be a central message of his presidential campaign, it will be an inescapable part of his record and his own personal narrative. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio announced his presidential run at the Freedom Tower in Miami \u2014 an Ellis Island of the South that served as a welcoming point for Cuban exiles into America. ", " The issue is also bound to be re-litigated by his opponents and voters, as it has during early appearances this year at a New Hampshire town hall and Iowa book signing. When pressed on the matter on the campaign trail, Rubio plans to tell voters that the comprehensive bill he co-authored will never pass Congress. ", " In his latest book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio argues that the approach he took in 2013 on immigration \u2014 one single bill to reform the entire system \u2014 was \u201csimply not realistic.\u201d He can assert that, Rubio says, because he knows of the experience firsthand. ", " \u201cEvery massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,\u201d Rubio said in the interview. ", " Instead, Rubio is renewing an argument he made originally that Congress should take up immigration reform in pieces, starting with proposals that Republicans largely support such as enforcement at the southern border, a mandatory electronic system to verify the legal status of employees and a new method to track people who overstay their visas. He\u2019ll argue that deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally is improbable, and call for an onerous series of steps to allow some to stay in the country. And a President Rubio would only entertain that possibility of citizenship after a enforcement-minded immigration laws are enacted first. ", " Such talk \u2014 and his decision to back away away from his own bill \u2014 seem to have alleviated some concern on the right that Rubio is not another McCain or Graham. ", " Yet it\u2019s also opened him to charges that the GOP lawmaker flip-flopped on the issue when the political temperature got too hot \u2013 simply to pander to the base of the party, and potentially leaving himself vulnerable to Latino voters in a general election. ", " In June 2013, the same month that his immigration bill passed the Senate, a ", " showed that his \u201cstrongly favorable\u201d ratings among Republicans had tumbled by 11 points since the previous August. ", " Rubio began to make amends with conservatives. Immediately after the bill passed the chamber, he shifted his attention to a range of economic reforms and other matters. He refused to call on the GOP-led House to pass the Senate bill, even as the other seven co-authors planned an aggressive public pressure campaign on House Republicans. ", " Rubio blamed President Barack Obama for scuttling the bill\u2019s chances, saying no conservative trusts the White House to implement the border control provisions. Republicans in the House agreed. ", " His shift to the right didn\u2019t stop there. At the height of last summer\u2019s border crisis, Rubio called for the 2012 Obama administration program that halts deportations of young undocumented immigrants \u2014 an initiative highly popular with Latinos \u2014 to eventually end. ", " Critics say his handling of immigration feeds the perception that Rubio lacks any significant legislative accomplishments in his short time in the Senate. And immigration activists who were once impressed with Rubio for taking on the politically fraught task of writing a reform bill now see him as a sell-out. ", "MICHAEL GRUNWALD and ", " \u201cEvery time he gets on his knees and begs for forgiveness from the nativist right in the GOP, I cringe,\u201d said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate who leads America\u2019s Voice, a left-leaning, pro-reform group. \u201cHe will always be known as the guy who stood up for something he seemed to believe in and backed down when it was politically convenient to do so.\u201d ", " It\u2019s unclear how Rubio would fare among Latino voters if he were to win the GOP nomination. The polling firm Latino Decisions found in a November survey of Latino voters that Rubio is viewed favorably by 31 percent of Latinos vs. 36 percent who saw him unfavorably. About one-third of those voters had not heard of Rubio, or had any opinion on the senator. ", " Despite concerns for some on the right, public polls show the senator still has a serious chance to win a wide-open race. A ", " from March showed that 56 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Rubio \u2014 a higher figure than received by any other of the 13 GOP contenders listed by the poll. ", " Perhaps that\u2019s because Rubio has moved to ensure he\u2019s not identified strictly with the immigration issue. He\u2019s been laying out economic reform ideas, from making higher education more affordable to helping narrow the income gap. At the same time, he has maintained his staunchly conservative views on social issues and foreign policy. ", " \u201cI\u2019m struck by how much he has recovered,\u201d said Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, who two years ago ", " to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the Gang of Eight. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on it, but there do seem to be some politicians whom lots of voters want to like and are eager to forgive for their mistakes,\u201d Kristol said, citing Ronald Reagan as an example. \u201cOthers who are less likable get held to a stricter standard. So Rubio\u2019s apparent comeback over the last couple of years may indicate a kind of underlying strength there that one might not have expected.\u201d ", " Yet, Rubio is still likely to be the left of the likes of Ted Cruz when it comes to immigration reform. ", " In \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio said he would address immigrants already here illegally once Congress has passed enforcement proposals and turned the current legal immigration system into one based on merit and economic considerations, not family ties. ", " At that point, he said he would institute a system to register those here illegally, deporting ones who have committed serious crimes or who have not been in the United States long enough. Undocumented immigrants who pay a fine, learn English and undergo background checks could then obtain a temporary legal status, something they would have to hold for at least 10 years before applying for permanent residence. ", " Rubio said he would not create a so-called special pathway, meaning a way to obtain citizenship that isn\u2019t afforded to other immigrants. That highly contentious provision \u2014 to provide a pathway to citizenship \u2014 was included in the Gang of Eight proposal. ", " \u201cHe not going to run away from it, he\u2019s going to talk about it,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership, a group that advocates for conservative causes among Latinos. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to say that it\u2019s important to deal with the issue.\u201d ", " Aguilar, who has lobbied GOP lawmakers on immigration reform, said Rubio should have tried harder to recruit other conservative Republicans to the Gang of Eight so he wasn\u2019t the sole emissary charged with selling the bill to the right. One target might have been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was considered part of the group in its early stages. ", " But still, many Republicans said Rubio should get political credit for at least trying to solve a tough issue. ", " \u201cWhat cannot be denied is that while many of his colleagues will be critical, they have yet to propose any viable solution to a problem that everybody in the United States understands is there,\u201d said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who is backing Jeb Bush but says he\u2019s a \u201chuge admirer\u201d of his home-state senator. \u201cRubio had the courage to take on a very, very controversial issue.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

He\u2019s in an ambulance accompanying his Cuban-born grandfather, who has just broken his hip, to the hospital, translating for the paramedics.

But, unlike his 2012 memoir, this book\u2019s primary focus is outlining policy prescriptions on a range of subjects. Rubio, 43, heartily embraces what\u2019s known as reform conservatism, and he tries hard to come across as an \u201cideas guy.\u201d ", "Story Continued Below", " Overall the book is relatively cautious. Rubio briefly touches on immigration reform, ", " to supporters and critics alike. He predictably criticizes President Barack Obama and likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He faults Republicans for being overly negative and offering stale ideas. But he calls none of his potential 2016 Republican rivals out by name. ", " Here are 10 of the most notable quotes from the 195-page tome, which hits bookshelves Tuesday: ", " ", " ", " The freshman senator name drops at least four Democratic senators whom he\u2019s sponsored legislation with, but he is eager to contrast himself with Hillary Clinton. He criticizes the former secretary of state for not offering detailed plans to fix Social Security and Medicare. He also rips her for saying during an October speech, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you it\u2019s businesses and corporations that create jobs.\u201d (Clinton\u2019s team insists she simply misspoke.) ", " Rubio argues the problems of the 21st century cannot be solved with 20th century solutions. \u201cHillary Clinton has proven herself wedded to the policies and programs of the past,\u201d he writes, \u201con each of the major challenges facing America.\u201d ", " ", " ", " Rubio supports raising the retirement age for Social Security as a way to ensure the system\u2019s solvency and to reflect longer life expectancies. It\u2019s perhaps the most politically risky territory he treads in the book. He says acting soon will allow people currently over the age of 55 to be spared. Rubio also advocates reducing the growth of benefits to upper-income seniors as well as eliminating the payroll tax on workers who have already reached retirement age. ", " On Medicare, he supports a voucher-like system in which seniors would get a set amount of money and can choose between traditional fee-for-service Medicare and private providers. ", " ", " ", " Rubio says advances in artificial intelligence don\u2019t always help American workers. He mentions self-checkout lines at supermarkets, the ability to order food from a computer instead of a waitress at Chili\u2019s and UPS workers \u201cnervously eyeing Amazon\u2019s plans to replace them with delivery drones.\u201d ", " His broader point is that it\u2019s important to support vocational education so that workers are equipped to build, fix and work alongside machines. ", " ", " ", " In a lengthy riff, Rubio describes higher education as an entrenched monopoly akin to Ma Bell before the breakup. He complains that students take out massive loans without appreciating the consequences. He adds that \u201cthe open spigot of federal student loans flowing into colleges and universities has become a cost-free government subsidy.\u201d ", " What he means is that colleges keep raising tuition higher because they know it will be easy for students to take out low-interest government loans to pay whatever is charged. Later, the students wind up with unsustainable debt. The set-up, he says, is a major driving force behind the $1.25 trillion student debt load. ", " Rubio doesn\u2019t support cutting off federal student loans, but he says he wants to make students smarter about taking out loans and hold higher education institutions \u201caccountable.\u201d ", " ", " ", " Rubio defends his personal opposition to gay marriage, but he said each state should have the right to choose its path on the topic. He also stresses that he opposes discrimination and harassment of people based on their sexual preference. ", " This week, as gay marriages began in Florida, Rubio ", " federal courts for ignoring the will of the people by ordering the state to issue marriage licenses. Former Florida Gov.

He complains several times that \u201cboth parties\u201d deserve blame for not embracing policies to cope with the fundamental transformation. ", " ", " ", " Opportunity inequality is a key concept in the book. Rubio defines it as \u201cthe inequality between those who can afford to influence government and those who can\u2019t.\u201d He says that \u201cincome inequality \u2014 so much the focus of liberals these days \u2014 is a byproduct of opportunity inequality.\u201d ", " Rubio says \u201cboth parties are guilty\u201d of practicing crony capitalism and complains that the tax code \u201cactively discriminates\u201d against families raising children. \u201cYou know what they say about tax policy in Washington: If you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d he writes. ", " ", " ", " Rubio does not call for scaling back the social safety net. In fact, he explains his support for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit with what he calls a Wage Enhancement Credit for low-income workers. ", " It would mean workers earning less than $20,000 a year would receive a monthly 30 percent credit from the federal government, with smaller rebates for people earning up to $40,000-a-year. That would be a significant financial transfer to low-income individuals. ", " ", " ", " Rubio, who has positioned himself as one of the more hawkish contenders in the 2016 mix, does not name Sen. Rand Paul, but there\u2019s little doubt this statement refers to the Kentucky Republican. To make clear that he\u2019s not just talking about Obama, the senator adds: \u201cNo single president, no single party and no single Congress has been solely at fault.\u201d ", " He describes it as \u201cthe political path of least resistance\u201d to support scaling back America\u2019s commitments overseas.

And ", "of them are subsidized. ", " Rubio started pushing his vision well before Barack Obama entered the White House and began work on what would become the Affordable Care Act. But by the time Florida Health Choices launched post-Obamacare, the response by Floridians was tepid. The newly declared GOP presidential candidate didn\u2019t include it in his campaign\u2019s vision for how to repeal and replace the federal law. Nor did he mention it in a recent Fox News op-ed headlined \u201cMy three part plan for the post-Obamacare era.\u201d ", " By the Feb. 15 Obamacare enrollment deadline, Florida Health Choices had signed up 56 individuals, and as of the middle of this week it had gained 24 more, CEO Rose Naff said in an interview. The state has set aside $2.4 million for the exchange since 2008 \u2014 an initial $1.5 million infusion that year and $900,000 in 2013. ", " Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator continues to support a \u201ctrue free-market exchange,\u201d and she blamed Obamacare\u2019s subsidies for luring buyers away from Florida Health Choices. ", " \u201cWhat\u2019s in Obamacare is neither free-market or truly an exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that this disastrous health care law is impacting the Florida Health Choices program, which is exactly the kind of consumer-based health care solution Americans are looking for.\u201d ", " But critics say the struggles of the Florida plan illustrate the vast hurdles that Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates would face in seeking to replace Obamacare with a market-oriented plan \u2014 their usual answer to how they would cover the millions of people now insured under the Affordable Care Act. The Florida plan may be voluntary. It may be an easy way to shop online, either for health insurance or smaller dental or vision policies. But it doesn\u2019t subsidize low-income or middle-class families the way Obamacare does. ", " \u201cIt makes sense that he doesn\u2019t talk about it right now,\u201d Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that supports Obamacare, said of Rubio. Referring to the subsidies, Pollack added, \u201cThe notion of promoting coverage in a way that does not enable people to get one of the significant benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2026 is really harmful and would cause millions of people to be far worse off than they are today.\u201d ", " Florida\u2019s Naff has a different perspective, saying, \u201cI know the numbers seem small, but it\u2019s been steady.\u201d She added, \u201cThere is really no rational comparison between HealthCare.gov and Florida Health Choices. We\u2019re not giving it away.\u201d ", " Obamacare\u2019s been big in Florida, which has signed up more people than any other state. And that happened even though Republican Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature have refused to set up a state exchange that meets ACA requirements or expand Medicaid. ", " Rubio included Florida Health Choices in his 2006 book, \u201c100 Innovative Ideas for Florida\u2019s Future.\u201d In the state Legislature, he clashed over it with then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who Rubio would go on to defeat in the 2010 Senate race. A ", " from Rubio\u2019s office when he was Florida House speaker said his plan relied on \u201csound market principles\u201d and \u201cchallenges the way health care is currently financed and purchased.\u201d ", " Exchanges as a concept have garnered backing from Republicans for years. In Massachusetts, then-Gov. Mitt Romney built the state\u2019s health care reform plan around exchanges in a system that was the precursor to Obamacare. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pushed for his state to create an exchange before Obama was in the White House. Utah also had a version for small businesses. ", " But that backing of exchanges didn\u2019t translate into support for Obamacare. To the contrary, conservatives saw the ACA exchanges as a corruption of their idea, too heavily regulated, too filled with mandates. ", " Rubio has long called for repeal of the Democrats\u2019 health law, and he stressed that again as he formally announced his 2016 presidential run in Miami on Monday evening. He has also pitched broad outlines of a \u201creplace\u201d plan, drawing on ideas often floated by conservatives like letting people buy insurance across state lines. But his outline doesn\u2019t make any mention of incorporating exchanges, even a slimmed-down version akin to Florida Health Choices. ", " In the Fox News ", ", Rubio called for \u201cadvanceable, refundable tax credits that all Americans can use to purchase health insurance.\u201d He also suggested he would target the current tax breaks for job-based insurance and set up high-risk pools to help people with costly pre-existing medical conditions get coverage. ", " Obamacare will almost certainly still be an issue in the 2016 campaign. But how it plays out five years after passage, and what kind of detail voters will be seeking from candidates, is not yet clear. ", " Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist based in the crucial primary state of New Hampshire, said Obamacare will still resonate in the campaign, but health care will likely be talked about in the broader context of the economy rather than a singular battle cry.

Is this really what we should have done, and is there a better way to get at it while preserving some common things that people agree on?\u201d Burnett said. If a Republican candidate doesn\u2019t have a clear and compelling message for moving beyond the Affordable Care Act, he added, \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be very problematic for them and their candidacy.\u201d ", " A Democratic nominee could potentially use the low enrollment figures from Florida Health Choices against Rubio should he secure the nomination, but the state-focused issue may not matter to most voters, Burnett said. ", " Other Republicans in Florida say they aren\u2019t worried about the low enrollment figures. ", " \u201cIf I\u2019m selling hamburgers, and across the street they\u2019re selling hamburgers for free or subsidized, I know my outlook is not going to be as good,\u201d said state Sen.

", " At minimum, the issue will remain in play for months, by the admission of the State Department itself, which has said it will take that long to review and release some 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton surrendered only in response to its queries last fall. But the hunger of the media, the determination of her critics and the extent to which the contours of this scandal fit a pattern of secrecy in Clinton\u2019s career seem destined to keep it going longer.

", "BILL SCHER", " In the battles to come, the questions (asked and answered, and un-responded to alike) will persist to the moment of her inauguration, and beyond, if it comes to that. Already, there are new disputes about just how many electronic devices she uses, and about her recent assertion that she never throws anything away is \u201clike two steps short of a hoarder.\u201d Clinton has to know that questions will persist and is presumably committed to a long game. ", " More than once in her news conference, with the blue-and-white logo of the U.N. Security Council behind her, Clinton said that her exclusive use of a private email account to conduct the government\u2019s business was \u201callowed\u201d or \u201cpermitted,\u201d which is not the same thing as saying it was fully endorsed or approved of, and explains why she is now asking forgiveness. Her point is well taken that many of her emails were sent to officials with State Department or other government accounts and were thus automatically preserved, as envisioned by federal requirements. ", " Did she break any law? Doubtful. Did she comply fully with the spirit of regulations in existence during her tenure, and since tightened? Probably not. ", " Clinton\u2019s argument that she chose to use one email device for \u201cconvenience\u201d must have surprised many of her State Department aides, who scrupulously carried two at all times, without noticeable burden (and without someone else to carry them, as the secretary of state would have had). As she knows better than almost any living American, political figures from Caesar\u2019s wife on have been held to a higher standard than convenience. ", " The situation would be different if Clinton had a lifelong reputation for transparency. Instead, she has made it clear on more than one occasion that sharing information with interlocutors, adversaries or enemies simply emboldens them to demand more. This enduring truth, all by itself, explains why the email flap has legs, in the eyes of her critics and more than a few of her supporters alike. ", " In the 1990s, Clinton opposed surrendering documents to the various special prosecutors who tormented her husband\u2019s administration. Long-sought billing records from the Rose Law Firm where she worked in Arkansas were mysteriously discovered in a White House closet by a long-serving aide in the midst of the Whitewater inquiry. ", " Clinton portrayed her decision to ask the State Department to release the emails she turned over \u2014 some 30,000, approximately half of all that she wrote and received during her tenure \u2014 as an unprecedented disclosure that would shed intriguing light on the highest workings of government. That may turn out to be so. Some day. ", " But since Clinton and her lawyers did the curating all by themselves, her reputation as an archivist is right now more akin to Bess Truman\u2019s, whose husband famously found her burning their love letters in the family fireplace in Independence, Missouri, after they left the White House. \u201cBess, think of history!\u201d Harry is supposed to have said. \u201cI am,\u201d she replied and kept on burning. ", " The Clinton who appeared in New York on Tuesday was visibly older (with what Hollywood would call laugh lines creasing her face) than the one who faced similar scrutiny two decades ago. It is perhaps a testament to the demands of the modern media age that she could not invoke the traditional candor of those approaching three-score-and-ten to say, \u201cThis is not important, but I know what is: The lives and hopes and needs of ordinary Americans.\u201d ", " Whether or not she ever becomes president, Clinton is already something close to what her idol Eleanor Roosevelt was sometimes called: the first lady of the world. In that context, it is poignant to recall how the public\u2019s relationship with its political heroes has changed just in Clinton\u2019s lifetime. ", " One sticky afternoon in the spring of 1946 \u2014 the year before Clinton was born \u2014 Mrs. Roosevelt was meeting a friend, the pioneering female lawyer and theatrical agent Fanny Holtzmann, in Holtzmann\u2019s Greenwich Village apartment. Roosevelt arrived, damp but full of fight, after a long subway ride from her job as a delegate at the temporary headquarters of the new United Nations at the old Hunter College campus in the Bronx. ", " \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take a taxi?\u201d Holtzmann demanded. ", " and ", " \u201cMy dear Fanny, do you realize how much a taxi from the Bronx costs?\u201d Roosevelt said, going on to explain how she\u2019d been an anonymous straphanger until a young man recognized her and offered her his seat. \u201cUntil that moment,\u201d she said, \u201cI had been just another old lady in the jostling crowd, trying to stay on my feet and catch a breath of air. The instant he called out my name and offered me his seat, the whole car came to life. A path opened up for me like the Red Sea parting \u2026\u201d ", " Roosevelt was just 61 on that hot afternoon, and Clinton is now 67. She\u2019s long since become enough of a New Yorker to know that the Bronx is up and the Battery\u2019s down. She may travel in an armored SUV instead of on the IRT, but she\u2019s banking that she\u2019s ready for the ride, and that there\u2019s a path ahead. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

I have enough self-awareness to know that this is an opportunity for me to be able to share who I am and my leadership skills.\u201d ", " That same night, at a fundraiser for Iowa Congressman David Young, Bush regaled a crowd at the Living History Farms, an agriculture-focused museum, about his trips to the Muscatine pork roasts and encounters with the state\u2019s popular Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley in 1980, the year George H.W. Bush won the Iowa caucuses during his unsuccessful run for president. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve been to Iowa where my dad lost [in 1988], I\u2019ve been there when he won, and I like the winning part better, to be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I intend to come back with regularity should I [run], and I\u2019m excited about that prospect. Because I have a record I think people might be interested in learning about.\u201d ", " The next morning, at an agriculture summit hosted by major GOP donor Bruce Rastetter, the first question Bush received was about his experiences in Iowa with his father and brother. Again, Bush drew on his time with his father\u2019s first campaign in Iowa to demonstrate attachment to the state. ", " \u201cI remember eating really well \u2014 eating really, really well \u2014 which I enjoyed, meeting a lot of nice people,\u201d he said. ", " \u201dI learned a lot by campaigning for my dad and for my brother.\u201d ", " In his four appearances, Bush didn\u2019t shy away from the issue of his lineage so much as tackle it, leveraging the opportunity to talk about his familiarity with the state and his intention to compete there, despite the seeming difficulty of reconciling his style of moderate conservatism with Iowa\u2019s deeply conservative GOP base. ", " \u201cThe last time I was here was in 1980, when I got to campaign for, in my humble opinion, the greatest man alive: my dad,\u201d Bush said to raucous cheers as he opened a gathering at Pizza Ranch here in Cedar Rapids on Saturday night. \u201cAs a youngster campaigning for my dad, I learned how to make mistakes, I learned how to be humiliated in public \u2014all the things people aspire to learn to do. It was a joy, people in Iowa treated all of the Bush family so well.\u201d ", "WILLIE NELSON", " But, he told the packed room, while many people know him as \u201cGeorge\u2019s boy or Barbara\u2019s boy or W\u2019s brother, all of which I\u2019m very proud of,\u201d he wants people to know that \u201cI\u2019ve been on my own journey as well.\u201d ", " Throughout the weekend, Bush returned to that message time and again. But the former Florida governor hasn\u2019t had to campaign for himself since 2002, when he last ran for re-election, and he\u2019s relearning the craft of working a room. While he\u2019s never at a loss for words, he was understated in approaching voters and making conversation in small settings. He frequently responded to comments with the word \u201csweet,\u201d an unexpected verbal tic from a 62-year-old politician. But he largely provided the accessibility Iowa voters expect and demand, wading through crowds of voters and reporters and fielding a raft of questions and photo requests. ", " \u201cI intend to hang out with people, if I\u2019m a candidate, and engage with them and learn from them and answer their questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a bubble campaign.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Two other senators in recent years, the late Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Ensign of Nevada, each stepped aside from leadership posts as they faced scrutiny over their actions in public office. And Menendez as well as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) are likely to face heightened pressure after the Justice Department unveils the charges.

", " A federal grand jury in New Jersey has for months been investigating Menendez\u2019s interactions with Salomon Melgen, a close friend and financial backer of the senator, prompting Menendez to rack up hundreds of thousands in legal bills as the probe intensified. A New Jersey newspaper reported this week that several Menendez aides declined to answer questions before the grand jury, citing a constitutional privilege that covers the New Jersey Democrat and other lawmakers and staff.

", " Sources familiar with the probe say the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity unit, which prosecutes federal officials, along with the FBI have cast a wide net, looking at his public actions even before he first came to Congress as a House member in 1993. Menendez was appointed to the Senate in 2006, and won reelection in 2012. In his 2006 and 2012 races, Menendez faced scrutiny over whether he improperly used his office to help his allies. ", " CNN first reported the expected corruption charges, which could come in the next few weeks. ", " The charges imperil the career of the powerful New Jersey Democrat, who has emerged as a prominent Democratic skeptic of the White House\u2019s dealings with Iran and Cuba.

Melgen has repaid those funds. FBI agents and investigators from the Department of Health and Human Services have searched the Florida ophthalmologist\u2019s offices twice as part of the probe. ", " Other actions by Menendez have also come under scrutiny. He contacted the State and Commerce departments for help in pressuring the Dominican Republic\u2019s government to honor a contract with a port security company owned by Melgen. The senator had traveled repeatedly on Melgen\u2019s private plane, and Menendez was forced to repay $70,000 from his own pocket for some unreported flights after they came to light. ", " Melgen has also donated heavily to Menendez\u2019s campaigns, including $700,000 in 2012 to a Democratic super PAC that spent heavily to help the senator secure reelection. ", " \u201cWe celebrated holidays together, we have been there for family weddings and sad times like funerals. And have given each other birthday, holiday and wedding presents just as friends do,\u201d Menendez said on Friday night.

", " \u201cAs we have said before, we believe all of the senator\u2019s actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that. Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason,\u201d his spokeswoman, Tricia Enright, said in a statement.

Menendez angrily denied the report, which came just days before the 2012 election and could not be substantiated. ", " However, the media attention surrounding Menendez\u2019s relationship with Melgen led to the discovery of several unreported flights by the senator on Melgen\u2019s plane. ", " The FBI and other federal investigators began looking into the Menendez-Melgen relationship, which eventually led to the expected criminal charges against the senator. ", " The 61-year-old Menendez is not up for reelection until 2018. It remains to be seen whether it will be politically tenable for him to remain in his position on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he helps shape U.S. foreign policy debates and receives classified information, if he is indicted. ", " Reid and other top Democrats will come under pressure to force Menendez out of that post. Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) had to step down as Ways and Means Committee chairman when he came under investigation, and Stevens had to give up his post as ranking member on the Appropriations Committee when he was indicted in 2008. ", " It\u2019s not the first time Menendez has faced legal scrutiny. ", " In 2006, FBI agents began looking into Menendez\u2019s relationship with a nonprofit organization that rented office space from him. Menendez had secured millions of dollars in federal funds for the organization. Republicans attacked Menendez repeatedly over the issue during a nasty 2006 Senate race, but the Democrat vehemently denied any wrongdoing and the controversy failed to derail his election. In an unusual move in 2011, the Justice Department announced the criminal probe had ended. ", " In addition to his ties to Melgen, federal investigators have more recently on Menendez\u2019s ties to Roberto and William Isaias. The brothers, who fled to the United States, are fighting extradition to Ecuador over charges that they allegedly embezzled tens of millions of dollars from the country\u2019s largest bank before it collapsed and had to be rescued by the Ecuadoran government. The Isaias brothers were sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison. ", " Menendez repeatedly contacted senior officials in the State and Homeland Security departments on the family\u2019s behalf. Menendez also intervened with the State Department on behalf of Estefania Isaias, the daughter of Roberto Isaias, over her visa problems, according to media reports. Family members of the Isaias\u2019 brothers donated $10,000 to Menendez\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, as well as more than $100,000 to the Democratic Party. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

He was taking on Florida\u2019s popular Republican governor, Charlie Crist, who had all the name recognition, big endorsements and early money. The party establishment was pressuring Rubio to wait his turn, to skip the primary and seek a more age-appropriate office he could actually win.

", "Story Continued Below", " And as Rubio wrote in his autobiography, ", ", the hectoring from other party elites just made him mad. He believed his consistent Obama-bashing conservatism would play better in a Republican primary than Crist\u2019s mushy Obama-hugging moderation, and he refused to be muscled out of the race. In the end, it was Crist who dropped out of the primary to avoid a drubbing \u2014 and Rubio who cruised from 3 percent to the Senate. ", " \u201cFor Marco, being told he can\u2019t do something is a challenge,\u201d says Tallahassee lobbyist Bill Helmich, who recalls staffing Rubio\u2019s campaign in the barebones days when the \u201cThree Percent Club\u201d were viewed as crazy cultists by the Florida Republican establishment. \u201cHe\u2019s an athlete. He goes at it as hard as he can.\u201d ", " This evening in Miami, Rubio is expected to announce that he\u2019s running for president, pursuing a destiny that national Republicans have speculated about ever since his come-from-way-behind Senate upset. And as Helmich says, \u201cthere are definitely parallels between Marco\u2019s situation today and in 2010.\u201d He is again polling in low single digits in the Republican field, again defying party mandarins who say he\u2019s got a bright future but it\u2019s not yet his time. The main difference is that many of those pay-your-dues establishment voices now believe it\u2019s his former mentor Jeb Bush\u2019s time. ", " There does not seem to be a pivotal meeting or moment that persuaded Rubio to try to beat the odds once more; as in 2010, he just never came up with a compelling reason why he shouldn\u2019t. ", " For a Republican primary electorate that liked Mitt Romney\u2019s policy stances but wished he were more charismatic, less plutocratic, more authentically conservative and less distasteful to the fast-growing Latino demographic, well, a Cuban-American Tea Party darling with working-class roots and rare magnetism makes a lot of sense. There\u2019s been a sense in Washington that Rubio missed his moment ever since the bipartisan immigration reform he was pushing \u2014 his one real deviation from conservative Republican orthodoxy on foreign or domestic policy \u2014 ran aground on Capitol Hill. But as he has often told aides when the buzz has been in his favor, the flavor of the month can change in a hurry. ", " So Rubio has been assembling a new Three Percent Club (more like Eight Percent in the 2016 polls so far) of veteran Republican operatives. They like his compelling personal narrative \u2014 he\u2019s the child of a bartender and a hotel maid who came to America seeking freedom and the opportunity to climb out of poverty \u2014 and his ability to connect that narrative to conservative themes of family and free enterprise. They see how he can mesmerize a room of grass-roots Republican activists or rich Republican donors. Yes, he\u2019s only 43, and few Americans know much about him beyond his awkward swig of water during his 2013 State of the Union response. But facing a likely battle against 68-year-old Hillary Clinton, some Republicans think a fresh face will create a more favorable contrast than another Bush. Rubio\u2019s friends say he tended to play devil\u2019s advocate in chats about his political future, but in the end his thinking seems to have been: Why not now? ", " Rubio and his team do not like to talk about strategy, but in any case, the political calculus of giving up a Senate seat to seek the brass ring was not as painful as it sounds. Even if Rubio doesn\u2019t win the nomination, he could well end up on the Republican ticket. Even if he ends up unemployed in 2017, he can run for governor in 2018 with a Republican-friendly mid-term electorate. He still has four children at home, but his wife Jeanette has always supported his ambitions. Most of all, though, Rubio concluded that he could win. He has never been afraid to run from behind \u2014 as a twenty-something knocking on doors to ask his neighbors to vote for him for West Miami commissioner, as an unknown challenging a well-known one-time TV reporter for state representative, as a back-bencher hoping to become speaker of the Florida House, and as a Senate hopeful supposedly embarking on a political suicide mission. ", " \u201cEveryone always says it\u2019s impossible, and then Marco does it,\u201d says Rebecca Sosa, who was mayor of West Miami when Rubio first ran for office and now chairs the Miami-Dade county commission. \u201cSome people call it a gift. I call it a blessing.\u201d ", " Whatever you call it, Marco Antonio Rubio clearly has star quality. His Miami friends say they always thought he\u2019d run for president someday, though few expected it to happen this quickly. His first job in politics was as a South Florida operative for Bob Dole\u2019s ill-fated presidential campaign in 1996; his friend Jose Mallea, who worked for Rubio as a campaign volunteer, says he basically outshone the candidate. \u201cWe knew we were going to get creamed, but Marco inspired us to work so hard,\u201d says Mallea, who went on to manage Rubio\u2019s 2010 campaign. \u201cWe respected Dole; we loved Marco.\u201d ", " Sosa recalls how the first time the baby-faced lawyer introduced himself at her front door and told her he wanted to run for the West Miami commission, he blew her away with an earnest soliloquy about living the American dream in a family of hardworking immigrants, about wanting to give back to the country that had given him so much. But Sosa also recalls that the first thing Rubio told her is that he knew he would have no chance of getting elected without her help \u2014 a shrewd bit of flattery from a cunning political animal. Rubio likes to bash the press for covering politics as a sport, but he teaches politics like a football coach to students at Florida International University, breaking down the Xs and Os of everything from how to keep in touch with your constituents to how to win a leadership race. ", " In fact, Rubio\u2019s detractors have often suggested that he\u2019s more concerned about the next job than getting stuff done in his current job. His autobiography is virtually devoid of substantive accomplishments beyond a local tree-planting project. In unguarded moments, Rubio\u2019s allies describe him not so much as the right messenger with the right message for the right moment, but as an awesome messenger with an awesome message who could be plugged into any moment \u2014 and this one will do fine. Any Republican nominee is likely to argue for less government, less regulation, less social spending, lower taxes, and a more belligerent foreign policy. Rubio just happens to be exceptionally adept at making those arguments \u2014 in two languages. ", " He proved it in 2010, when the broad support for Crist among Florida power brokers forced Rubio to travel outside the state to seek money and attention. His victory made him a conservative rock star, prompting invitations to speak on behalf of GOP candidates across the nation, including Romney, who put him on his short list of running mates. His book tours \u2014 he followed up his memoir with a policy book called ", " \u2014 have also gotten him face time around the country. ", " \u201cHe was exposed to a whole different world out there, a lot of people who have helped him create a national fundraising network,\u201d says his former state House colleague Gaston Cantens, who is now a sugar industry lobbyist. \u201cIt\u2019s those people who have continued to encourage him to run for president.\u201d ", " It\u2019s hard for any politician to ignore that kind of encouragement, and the grass-roots response to Rubio has been reminiscent of the Democratic response to Obama during his pre-presidential book tour. By early 2013, some polls suggested he would be a favorite if he decided to seek the White House, and Beltway types began talking him up as a potential Republican version of Obama, a sharp-minded, silver-tongued first-term senator who doesn\u2019t look like a traditional presidential candidate but could attract new voters to the cause. The Washington buzz quieted after immigration reform crashed and burned, but his team says the response to Rubio from party activists and big-ticket donors remained wildly enthusiastic. ", " \u201cHe didn\u2019t hear \u2018no, no, no,\u2019\u201d says former Florida House Republican leader Adam Hasner. \u201cHe was getting \u2018yes, yes, yes.\u2019\u201d ", " Inevitably, his interest in the White House has created tensions with Governor Bush, his most important supporter during his Tallahassee career and arguably during his Senate campaign. Bush backers recall that Rubio repeatedly visited Bush in his Coral Gables office to ask his advice, and that Bush gave it too, as well as introductions to donors. \u201cHe told Marco not just to hang in there against Crist, but who to ask for help and how,\u201d one adviser says. The Bush team also says Rubio would have ducked the race if Bush hadn\u2019t persuaded him he could win. ", " \u201cJeb talked Marco out of the tree,\u201d another Republican says. ", " Norman Braman, a billionaire Miami car dealer who is Rubio\u2019s top financial backer \u2014 Jeannette actually works for his foundation \u2014 says that\u2019s revisionist history. ", " \u201cMarco did it on his own when almost no one else thought he could,\u201d he says. \u201cMarco\u2019s election was about Marco. It wasn\u2019t about Jeb.\u201d ", " The two men still have a mutual respect; after addressing the NRA\u2019s annual conference in Nashville, they sat together on their flight back to Miami and spent the entire three-hour trip talking and joking, aides say. But they\u2019re competing for similar turf, and for the most part, the Florida Republican establishment has stuck with Bush; his Tallahassee fundraiser in a spacious Hotel Duval ballroom attracted about 300 guests, while Rubio\u2019s event last Tuesday at the Governor\u2019s Club had just 20 donors. ", " That said, Rubio has not really focused on Florida issues as a senator, letting his Democratic counterpart Bill Nelson take the lead and putting himself forward on national and global topics instead. As a member of the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, he\u2019s been an outspoken voice on the Senate floor and on Fox News for a harder line on international affairs, accusing Obama of mishandling Iran, ISIS, Russia, Libya, Venezuela, and of course Cuba, among other countries. He\u2019s also established himself as a leading opponent of Obama\u2019s budget policies, recording one of the few Senate votes against the bipartisan deal to avoid the fiscal cliff in 2013. His one conservative apostasy, immigration reform, is the one issue where many Republicans believe the party needs to moderate a bit to win in 2016; Rubio got a surprisingly warm reception in 2013 on the issue from influential conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. ", " Rubio has been cagey about his plans, but by January friends and advisers could sense that he was running. ", " Gaston Cantens pulled him aside after one buffet dinner and put him on the spot: \u201cI\u2019ve got to know. Come on, what are you going to do?\u201d He says his longtime pal, normally so expansive and direct, got evasive and fidgety. \u201cI could tell from his body language that he was uncomfortable, but I could see in his eyes that he had the fire in the belly to run,\u201d Cantens recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say it, but I could tell he wanted it.\u201d ", " In late January, before a \u201cTeam Marco 2016\u201d retreat for his top supporters at the swanky Delano Hotel on South Beach, Rubio told his top aides: Prepare for a presidential campaign. He is no longer the fresh-faced flavor of the month, which seems to be Scott Walker, or the Tea Party favorite, which could be Rand Paul or Ted Cruz, and Bush seems to be the establishment choice. But he could be acceptable to all those competing wings of the party. ", " He still hasn\u2019t made it official that he\u2019s running; that should happen today at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, which once served as a kind of Ellis Island for Cuban refugees. \u201cI have a unique opportunity to start to pay back a debt to this country I\u2019ll never be able to repay,\u201d Rubio said outside his fundraiser last week. \u201cAnd if that opportunity is to serve in its highest office, I\u2019ve always felt that I have the obligation to go out, look at it, and see how realistic it was.\u201d The \u201calways\u201d was an interesting touch.

VOGEL", "The Koch brothers and their allies are pumping tens of millions of dollars into a data company that\u2019s developing detailed, state-of-the-art profiles of 250 million Americans, giving the brothers\u2019 political operation all the earmarks of a national party. ", " The move comes as mainstream Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, are trying to reclaim control of the conservative movement from outside groups. The Kochs, however, are continuing to amass all of the campaign tools the Republican National Committee and other party arms use to elect a president. ", "Story Continued Below", " The Koch network also has developed in-house expertise in polling, message-testing, fact-checking, advertising, media buying, dial groups and donor maintenance. Add mastery of election law, a corporate-minded aggressiveness and years of patient experimentation \u2014 plus seemingly limitless cash \u2014 and the Koch operation actually exceeds the RNC\u2019s data operation in many important respects. ", " \u201cThe Koch operations are the most important nonparty political players in the U.S. today, and no one else is even close,\u201d said a top Republican who has been involved in the last eight presidential campaigns. ", " ( ", ") ", " The least-known vehicle for the Kochs is a for-profit company known as i360, started by a former adviser to John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign after McCain lost to Barack Obama in 2008. Subsequently, it merged with a Koch-funded data nonprofit. The Koch-affiliated Freedom Partners, formed in late 2011, eventually became an investor, officials confirmed to POLITICO. ", " Spending more than $50 million in cash over the past four years, i360 links voter information with consumer data purchased from credit bureaus and other vendors. Information from social networks is blended in, along with any interaction the voter may have had with affiliated campaigns and advocacy groups. Then come estimated income, recent addresses, how often a person has voted, and even the brand of car they drive. Another i360 service slices and dices information about TV viewing to help campaigns target ads more precisely and cost efficiently. ", " GOP campaigns can get less-expensive data through the RNC, but happily pay i360 for its superior profiles. Midterm clients included several of the GOP\u2019s marquee Senate and gubernatorial victors, including Sens.-elect Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Gov.-elect Larry Hogan in Maryland. ", " ( ", ") ", " Michael Palmer, a Florida native who started i360 after being chief technology officer of Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said i360 has been able to develop superior campaign tools precisely because it isn\u2019t beholden to the political calendar. With a steady stream of money comes the ability to think about the long term, he said. ", " \u201cRight now, we\u2019re talking about and building things that you won\u2019t see in 2016, because it\u2019s not going to be ready until 2018,\u201d Palmer said. ", " One of the reasons that i360 has made such leaps is that the Kochs and their business-minded backers enforced a painful after-action review after the embarrassing Senate losses of 2012, looking across the organization at what could be done better. \u201cWe discovered, after 2012, that having a great database isn\u2019t all that useful unless you can make it actionable for people, by building tools and software,\u201d Palmer said. ", " ( ", ") ", " So for this year\u2019s midterms, he said, i360 offered \u201cmobile canvassing apps or data management interfaces, so our clients can actually access that data, report against it, manipulate it, and put it to use.\u201d ", " Palmer said i360 embeds experiments \u201cinto absolutely everything that we do.\u201d In Colorado, for instance, Americans for Prosperity \u2014 the most muscular part of the Koch network \u2014 worked with i360 to isolate 297,000 voters who were not likely to vote in 2014, but were likely to oppose the policies of Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who wound up being defeated by GOP Rep. Cory Gardner. ", " Among the 297,000 voters, some got no contact at all from AFP. About 60,000 voters were broken into six \u201ctreatment groups\u201d: One group got a knock on the door, plus a volunteer phone call and a mail piece. Another got door plus mail. Another got door only, and so forth. Within those groups, the messages varied. Now, as part of its midterm after-action review, i360 is figuring out which approach was most efficient in turning out a reluctant voter. ", " The RNC, which is part of a data-sharing partnership with i360 that was announced in August, is also building up its digital assets. Sean Spicer, RNC communications director, said: \u201ci360 is a great part of the larger team. One of the biggest differences is that the party supports anybody who has an \u2018R\u2019 next to their name. The RNC is providing the vast majority of data to House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates. And we\u2019ve been in the data game for 20 years. \u2026 All general election Republican candidates had access to our data, and it was our data that the highly successful ground game was run on.\u201d ", " This deep dive into the mechanics of politics reflects the Koch brothers\u2019 growing awareness that traditional forms of advocacy aren\u2019t, in isolation, effective enough to achieve the kind of conservative transformation the network\u2019s supporters envision. ", " For decades, the Kochs had pursued their goals by sinking tens of millions of dollars into wonky research and advocacy groups. It was only during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency that the brothers and their allies began to question whether the power of their ideas alone could carry the day. A movement that started with 15 rich conservatives gathering in Chicago and a single main group \u2014 Americans for Prosperity \u2014 by 2008 became a congregation of roughly 100 major donors backing a handful of think tanks, grass-roots advocacy networks and political organizations. ", " In 2012, the newly created Freedom Partners \u2014 the umbrella group for the Kochs\u2019 political operation \u2014 raised and spent roughly $250 million. Headed by Marc Short, a former top staffer in the House and Senate, Freedom Partners dispenses funds and expertise to myriad affiliate groups in the network. This year, it began wading into political and policy fights on its own \u2014 spinning off a super PAC that spent at least $24 million boosting Republican Senate candidates. ", " Heading into 2016, the Koch network \u2014 under the auspices of Freedom Partners \u2014 has in many ways surpassed the reach and resources of the RNC. And, unlike the party, it isn\u2019t bound by rules requiring it to maintain neutrality in primaries. Though the network has yet to engage in primaries, that could be the next logical step in its progression from apolitical think tank consortium to aggressive privatized political machine. ", " With good data, we can target them with the right message at the right moment. ", " The Kochs and their donors and operatives have been sought out by most of the leading 2016 GOP prospects \u2013 from Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Rick Perry of Texas. Their allies are acutely aware of the potential for the Koch groups and their donors to sway the primaries \u2014 even if they don\u2019t formally back a candidate. ", " A key adviser to one of the top GOP presidential prospects said: \u201cIf I could have Karl Rove or Marc Short to run a presidential campaign today, I\u2019d take Marc Short. He understands all the technical tools available to a modern campaign and how to apply them to the nominating process. He also has a deep understanding of the political dynamics of the GOP base vote.\u201d ", " Short\u2019s connection to another potential GOP presidential candidate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, is among the biggest reasons that the Kochs are considering whether going all-in on a presidential campaign would be a good investment. Short was chief of staff to the House Republican Conference when then-Rep. Pence was the chairman, and Short remains a close adviser to Pence. ", " Veterans of GOP presidential campaigns say that while the Kochs could not, by themselves, provide the credibility necessary to create a candidate for president, their weapons could make a decisive difference for someone who was already running a viable campaign for the nomination \u2014 someone like Pence, whose record could make him a bridge between the GOP\u2019s evangelical and establishment wings. ", " A candidate favored by the Kochs and their allies could potentially benefit from the full range activities of groups in the Koch network. The biggest presence is AFP, which spent $130 million in the midterms, with 550 paid staff, including 50 in Florida alone. ", " The LIBRE Initiative, a network-backed group aimed at Hispanics, has 40 staff at its Arlington, Virginia, headquarters and 40 field staff (25 of them part-time) in seven states. Generation Opportunity, the Kochs\u2019 outreach arm for 18- to 34-year-olds, has 30 full-time, paid grass-roots staffers running boots-on-the-ground activism in 10 states. Concerned Veterans for America, another Koch-backed group based in Arlington, has 60 paid staff in 14 states. ", " Pete Hegseth, an infantry captain in the Army National Guard who is the group\u2019s CEO, says veterans are \u201creflexively conservative, and they know how to organize.\u201d ", " \u201cWith good data, we can target them with the right message at the right moment,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cThey could be much more powerful than they are. There\u2019s no reason veterans can\u2019t be the unions of the right.\u201d ", " Hegseth doesn\u2019t talk much about the Koch connection, but says it\u2019s an asset. \u201cYou can deny or engage,\u201d he said. \u201cOther groups have been a flash in the pan.

They\u2019re poor kids with no school.\u201d ", " Paul also needled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: \u201cIt is the CONSERVATIVE Political Action Conference, so that might be your first problem he might encounter. It\u2019s harder for moderates to get a great reception at a conservative meeting.\u201d ", " Paul said conservatives need to reach beyond traditional audiences like gun-rights defenders to anyone who has been mistreated by Big Government, including \u201cbusinesses mistreated by Big Government regulations\u201d and \u201cpoor people \u2026 mistreated by Big Government and overcriminalization.\u201d ", " \u201cNo one really has taken the same message of Big Government incompetence to widely disparate groups and said to all of them: \u2018I will defend the Bill of Rights,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think that is a message that is a unifying message, not a dividing message.\u201d ", " Previewing his national message for the months ahead, Paul said his \u201cnew way\u201d means that conservatives \u201ctake the defense of the Bill of Rights and instead of only sort of talking about the Second Amendment, we take the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment to all kinds of audiences who are ready and waiting to hear this.\u201d ", " Paul said his mission is to \u201cget these kids excited\u201d and convince them \u201cthat you\u2019re going to really do something to make their future better and brighter.\u201d ", " \u201cThere\u2019s probably no speech with more kids all in one room that you\u2019ll have in almost any one season,\u201d he said. \u201cI see it as a way to try to pump up the next generation.\u201d ", " When asked if he sees CPAC as the first primary, Paul chuckled and said: \u201cYou know, I WISH it were.

Mike Lee that would use the tax code to reward families with children while slashing levies on business and investment income but keeping a top rate personal income rate of 35 percent, far higher than many Republicans would like.

", " \u201cAmerica right now suffers from slow growth, and the growth there is doesn\u2019t seem to be helping most Americans, including the folks who vote in GOP primaries,\u201d said James Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe Rubio-Lee plan would address both issues through sweeping corporate tax reform and cutting investment taxes while also directing immediate tax relief for families.\u201d ", " But not all Republicans are embracing the plan. Some argue that it leaves the top rate far too close to the current highest bracket of 39.6 percent. And they note that it would apply the 35 percent rate to individual incomes as low as $75,000, possibly exposing many middle-income earners to a significant tax hike. ", " And in a field that already includes flat tax proposals from Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, analysts say this could leave Rubio as seemingly out of step and too timid on the tax cut front. It could also allow former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who will compete with Rubio in the more centrist lane of the GOP primary, to come up with a less complicated tax cut plan that hews more closely to Republican orthodoxy. ", " \u201cIf you are a GOP primary voter and not a policy wonk who follows this stuff closely, you might not really understand what Rubio is trying to do here,\u201d said Daniel J. Mitchell of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. \u201cThere is a risk that with Cruz and Paul both talking about a flat tax that Rubio, even though he does some big and important things, might get lost in the clutter.\u201d ", " Advocates of cutting taxes across the board to spur faster growth argue that Rubio, through his generous child credits and possible increases in marginal rates for some, is pursuing an approach much more traditionally associated with Democrats.

This one was long enough,\u201d Rubio joked. \u201cI hope that ideas like this are embraced by everyone running for president. Because I think our party has to be the pro-family, pro-growth party.\u201d ", " Under Rubio\u2019s plan, there would be just two tax personal income tax brackets, 15 percent and 35 percent. The plan would also create a new child tax credit worth $2,500 and eliminate the estate tax. ", " On the corporate side, it would create a top rate of 25 percent, down form the current 35 percent, allow immediate deductions for investments and create a territorial tax system that would not apply U.S. tax rates to foreign income earned abroad by U.S. businesses. It would also eliminate business tax credits and many deductions. ", " Unlike some other previous GOP tax plans, including the 20 percent across-the-board reduction proposed by Mitt Romney in 2012, Rubio and Lee make no claims that the plan would not increase the deficit. ", " Instead, on a static basis \u2013 which does not include any possible faster economic growth through tax cuts \u2013 an analysis by the Tax Foundation found that the plan would add around $4 trillion to the current $18 trillion debt over ten years. ", " Rubio and Lee look to offset some of the revenue loss under the plan by having the top rate kick in at $75,000 for individuals and $150,00 for married couples. Many high earners could avoid the hit because of the rate cuts for dividends and capital gains and by earning profits from business ventures that would be capped at the 25 percent rate. But those who simply earn labor income could get hit with a significantly higher rate, something that Rubio\u2019s opponents are likely to highlight early and often. ", " \u201cThere will be some set of taxpayers who earn labor income and don\u2019t have kids who would all of a sudden be hit with a 35 percent rate,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThat would be the bad part of the plan.\u201d ", " Still, the so-called \u201creform conservative\u201d movement, made up of younger policy wonks who want to nudge the GOP away from its reliance on massive, across the board tax cut plans, has mostly embraced Rubio\u2019s approach, giving the Florida senator some significant intellectual cache that other candidates lack. \u201cI can see the appeal of something like the Rubio-Lee plan that says we are going to charge families less and when you have kids we are going to help you out,\u201d said Charles C.W. Cooke, author of \u201cThe Conservatarian Manifesto.\u201d ", " Other conservatives to embrace the plan so far include Reihan Salam who said the child credit could help restrain the growth of government because if enacted it would cost a lot of money and be politically impossible to reverse.

No liberal guns group will ever support you, and you shun the grassroots army of NRA nation instead?\u201d ", " Another Iowa Republican, noting a current push in the state legislature to allow people to carry concealed handguns without a permit, said Ben Caron has expressed a level of openness for gun control in the past that has caused trouble at the grassroots level in conservative western Iowa.

Ayotte, the GOP senator, filibustered a 2013 bill that would have expanded the requirements in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.

", " One way around such complications would be if a congressional committee obtained the 55,000 page set and released it. Congress isn\u2019t bound by FOIA rules, so could release the data with fewer redactions.

", " \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from other people is that they want an actual primary,\u201d said Iowa City activist and blogger John Deeth. \u201cThe main problem with this whole email thing is that at the moment there\u2019s no real option.

The party\u2019s lack of depth at the national level is reflected in the flimsy emerging presidential field beyond the Clinton juggernaut, despite some activists\u2019 attempts to encourage popular figures to jump in the race to ensure Clinton is battle-tested before the general election. ", " It\u2019s a sign of Clinton\u2019s strength that none of the influential Democrats POLITICO surveyed on Wednesday or Thursday indicated that the email news would alone be enough to turn them away from Clinton entirely. The former senator and First Lady\u2019s allies have worked overtime to insist that the email flap is unimportant to Americans themselves. ", " \u201cVoters do not give a shit. They do not even give a fart,\u201d said longtime Clinton ally and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, echoing the sentiments of most Clinton allies who believe the all-but-certain nominee is enough of a defined quantity in voters\u2019 eyes that Republican attacks on her email policies cannot sway them \u2014 especially not over a year-and-a-half before she faces a competitive vote.

", " Other Democrats were more measured, insisting that the news was worrisome and that the party should field more presidential contenders in case Clinton struggles in a serious way. But most kept their criticisms to a minimum, and just one early-state figure reported hearing from any of the other potential candidates since the news broke on Monday night. ", " Some of Clinton\u2019s financial backers are scratching their heads as the story has spiraled into a major point of conversation on cable news and radio, questioning the turbulent home-stretch of Clinton\u2019s pre-campaign phase. ", " One Democratic donor told POLITICO on Wednesday that Clinton\u2019s last few days have caused concern in New York\u2019s influential donor community. But most of her high-level donors have stood staunchly by her side, and Clinton had a chance to speak with many of her backers on Wednesday night as she headlined the Clinton Foundation\u2019s annual gala \u2014 which cost between $2,500 and $100,000 to attend \u2014 in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. ", " After disappointing several supporters by not addressing the swirling controversies during a Tuesday appearance in Washington, Clinton on Thursday added a Saturday stop in Miami to her schedule \u2014 a stop where many Clinton-watchers expect her to comment on the news. ", " Announced just hours after Clinton tweeted that she had asked the State Department to release her emails after reviewing them, the appearance will be at an event that was originally supposed to be hosted just by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. ", " After her stop in Miami, Clinton will return to New York for a pair of major events where she will unveil her much-anticipated report on the status of women and girls worldwide, alongside a slate of high-profile women. ", " Clinton\u2019s recent stumbles, however, have served as a reminder of her struggles during her summer 2014 book tour, despite the carefully designed sprint through March. ", " \u201cThere is some concern. Some people are saying, \u2018Is this going to blow up in her face?,\u2019\u201d said Jack Hatch, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Iowa governor in 2014. ", " Others see the ongoing questions as an indication that Clinton has to better manage her public image in the weeks before she officially announces her candidacy, if Democrats are going to win the White House. ", " \u201cThis is a signal, it\u2019s a warning, that whatever [else] there may be \u2026 get it straight, be prepared to be open with it, above board,\u201d said former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, noting that at a moment of deep public distrust of the government, the last thing Clinton needs is to come across as secretive. \u201cShe can\u2019t afford to give any impression that, \u2018This is the way it\u2019s going to be from the start of my campaign, or from my government.\u2019 I think they\u2019re aware of that.\u201d ", " The general trust in Clinton\u2019s ability to handle the situation is not universal, however. At least one outspoken Democratic activist who has a bad history with the Clintons seized upon the news to insist that others jump in the race. ", " \u201cHer [potential] campaign is so disdainful of anybody who raises any issues,\u201d said former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Dick Harpootlian, a long-standing booster of Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cYou need to get out ahead of it. How does she not see that one coming?\u201d ", " Biden has raised some eyebrows by appearing in New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina in recent weeks on official White House business, but the vast majority of Democrats concede it is highly unlikely that the 72-year-old vice president throws his hat in the ring. ", " Few of Clinton\u2019s possible rivals have spent much time in the early states this year, though former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley has been ramping up his travel after subtly jabbing at Clinton during a stop in South Carolina last weekend. ", " But O\u2019Malley is not expected to weigh in on the email saga before the weekend, and even his friends in early states say the controversy is overblown. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the news. My wife and I have sat together to watch it on the news, and we have not said a word to each other about it. I\u2019ve had no one \u2014 what\u2019s it been out, three days? \u2014 not one person has said a thing. Family, friends, people I\u2019ve run into, not one person has brought it up as a topic,\u201d said O\u2019Malley friend Dan O\u2019Neil, an alderman in Manchester, N.H. ", " O\u2019Malley is set to appear in New Hampshire and Kansas this weekend before a speaking engagement in Washington next week and a swing through Iowa later this month. And former Virginia Sen. James Webb formed an exploratory committee in November, but he has been largely quiet since then, despite scheduling one Iowa appearance for late March. ", " Craig Crawford, Webb\u2019s spokesman, said he doesn\u2019t think voters care about Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cThey\u2019d rather all be talking about jobs and the economy and how working people can get a leg up when wages are falling and income at the top is growing,\u201d he said. ", " Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist who is technically an Independent, continues to waffle over running. And the groups backing a run by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she won\u2019t run, are unlikely to weigh in on anything Clinton does as they stick to positive messaging and work to organize in Iowa and New Hampshire for Warren. ", " But while Republicans and reporters continue to dig into Clinton\u2019s email practices, a mix of concerned resignation and urgency has settled in among Democrats involved in the nominating process. ", " \u201cIt may continue to haunt her,\u201d said Mary Hoyer, chair of Iowa\u2019s Henry County Democrats, in an email. \u201cShe has to go on the offensive and find her message or she will never overcome these \u2018paper cuts.\u2019\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

State Department officials noticed that some of the 15,000 pages of documents included a personal email address for Clinton, and State and White House officials conferred on how to handle the revelation, which they expected the committee to notice.

Instead, the records show State Department lawyers acted on sparse information about business proposals and speech requests and were under the gun to approve the proposals promptly. The ethics agreement did not require that Clinton provide the estimated income from his private arrangements, making it difficult for ethics officials to tell whether his services were properly valued.

The records include requests to speak to investment groups, colleges and foreign entities.

Those devices, which spin uranium into material that can be used for a nuclear weapon, will be stored under International Atomic Energy Agency oversight. Tehran will be left with 6,104 centrifuges, lower than some reported offers by the U.S., and 5,060 of those can be used to enrich uranium. ", " \u2014 Iran can keep open an underground nuclear facility at Fordow, a controversial site because it was built in secret and only revealed by the U.S. in 2009. Iran will not be required to close the facility but could use it only for research that does not include the enrichment of uranium.

The inspections would continue even after many elements of the deal have expired in 2025, including surveillance of Iran\u2019s centrifuge rotors until 2035. Iran has also agreed to some indefinite transparency measures.

(Obama can temporarily suspend sanctions passed by Congress, although only Congress can permanently repeal them.) The United Nations will also lift its sanctions on Iran after it meets the deal\u2019s requirements.

Once IAEA inspectors certify that Iran has met those conditions, Kerry said, sanctions will begin to be reduced. ", " The deal, key points of which were sent out to reporters by the White House, was unclear on some crucial questions that critics are sure to pounce on: ", " \u2014 Although the agreement specifies that Iran will dramatically \u201creduce\u201d its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 97 percent, from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms, details of the agreement provided by the Obama administration do not say how that will happen. U.S. officials are expected to require Iran to ship that material \u2014 which is more than halfway to the potency needed for a bomb \u2014 out of the country. But Iran has proposed to retain the material and simply dilute it to a form unsuitable for a nuclear weapon, although that dilution is reversible. ", " Kerry, however, said in Lausanne that negotiators have a resolution on what to do with Iran\u2019s uranium: \u201cIt has to be either diluted or sold on the international market, one of the two. \u2026 That is agreed upon at this point in time,\u201d he said. ", " \u2014 Iran has refused to answer a list of IAEA questions about its suspected past research into nuclear weapons technology, like explosives that can detonate highly enriched uranium. The agreement does not specify how or when that will happen, saying only that \u201cIran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA\u2019s concerns\u201d on the military research question. Mogherini said only that the nuclear agency \u201cwill have enhanced access through agreed procedures, including to clarify past and present issues.\u201d ", " Oil-rich Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for scientific, medical and other purposes, not for making weapons. On Thursday, Zarif said Iran has agreed to take steps to assure the world \u201cthat our program is exclusively peaceful, that our program always has been and always will be exclusively peaceful.\u201d But, he added, Iran will not close any of its nuclear facilities \u2014 a condition it said would have been unacceptable. \u201cWe have done significant work. We have made achievements. We have made progress,\u201d Zarif said. ", " Obama stressed in particular the inspection and verification aspects of the agreement. ", " \u201cIf Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see anything suspicious, we will inspect it,\u201d Obama said. He said Iran will face \u201cmore inspections than any other country in the world.\u201d And he said the relief from sanctions will be \u201cphased\u201d as long as Iran proves it is complying with the terms of an agreement. ", " \u201cIf there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be no deal.\u201d ", " Kerry contended that the deal has no sunset date. In reality, most of its provisions \u2014 how many centrifuges Iran can run, for instance \u2014 will expire after a decade. But Iran has agreed to a special arrangement with the IAEA known as the Additional Protocol, which grants the international agency\u2019s inspectors enhanced information about and access to the country\u2019s nuclear activities and infrastructure. The Additional Protocol has no time limit. ", " The deal\u2019s announcement came after a final round of negotiations in Lausanne, following a grueling marathon session that kept officials talking until 6 a.m. Thursday \u2014 and two days after a self-imposed deadline to reach a political agreement. Aside from the U.S. and Iran, countries participating include Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China.

", " In retrospect, the GOP opposition to bombing Syria after President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d threat in 2013 was the high-water mark for a Paulite impulse within the party. Soon enough, the red-line fiasco became a watchword for Obama\u2019s weakness and events \u2014 the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rise of ISIL, the diplomatic strains with Israel \u2014 revived a traditional GOP reflex toward toughness.

", " This gets to the difference between Ron and Rand Paul, of course. For Ron, the electoral pointlessness of his presidential runs was the point. He was a conviction politician who ran to generate support for a cause, not to win anything. ", " Rand believes he\u2019s in a different game, which is why he\u2019s increasingly a House-broken libertarian. His attacks on career politicians are particularly tinny as he maneuvers his way around the rules in Kentucky to run for president and reelection to the Senate at the same time, lest he face the prospect all politicians naturally dread: relinquishing office. ", " Nevertheless, Rand Paul\u2019s practicality compared to his father is a good thing. Libertarianism is a significant strain within the GOP and the less cranky and more serious its chief representative is, the better. On issues like criminal justice, Paul has been creative in urging his party to rethink its stale orthodoxies. ", " Yet it\u2019s not clear what Paul will get from all of this. He is in a tough field, much tougher than his dad ran against in 2008 and 2012, and faces the risk of underperforming him, even as he compromises \u2014 and obfuscates \u2014 to try to make himself more viable.

", " ", " ", " Rand Paul has a nuanced position on the issue. He does not support lifting the federal ban on marijuana use, but on federalism grounds he says that the national government should not overturn laws passed by D.C. and Colorado. He acknowledges drug use in his youth but says that his push to reduce sentences for nonviolent drug crimes should not be seen as an endorsement of drug use. ", " \u201cIf someone like Sen. Paul endorsed legalizing pot, I don\u2019t believe it would surprise anyone,\u201d said an uncommitted Iowa GOP activist. \u201cThere would be backlash against a more mainstream candidate, but I hope this isn\u2019t a top issue in 2016. We have a lot bigger problems.\u201d ", " Democrats in both states overwhelmingly believe that a presidential candidate could win their state\u2019s nominating contest if they came out for decriminalization, but that doesn\u2019t mean they think it\u2019s a good idea or that there would not be some backlash from traditional voters. ", " An Iowa Democrat said a presidential candidate would \u201cpay dearly to fast track\u201d legalization: \u201cIt is too much, too fast for Iowa voters. Medical use and [decriminalizing] is a stepping stone process that should be followed.\u201d ", " \u201cA candidate ", "get past whatever backlash occurred,\u201d said another. ", " A third Democrat worried that endorsing marijuana would risk making their candidate look out-of-touch: \u201cI think it says more about the values of the candidate than just the specific policy proposal. Democrats must demonstrate a connection to the challenges many families face each and every day. Legalizing pot suggests that we don\u2019t know about those things or care.\u201d ", " But a band of Iowa Democrats believes that it\u2018s worse not to support some change in the drug laws. \u201cClinton may need to address whether her Justice Department would be as tolerant of state-level medical marijuana and full legalization as Obama\u2019s has been,\u201d said one.

Six in 10 insiders \u2013 including three-quarters of Democrats \u2013 believe that the recreational use of marijuana will be legal in their state a decade from now, the way it is in Colorado now.

", " \u201cHe seems to have a poor understanding of what\u2019s actually on the Fed balance sheet and how the bank operates,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have a firm grip on one of your signature issues, people eventually are going to doubt other things you have to say.\u201d ", " The case against Paul\u2019s case against the Fed is fairly straightforward. ", " In his op-ed, Paul claimed that \u201c[t]he Fed has $4.5 trillion in liabilities and only 57 billion dollars in equity. It is leveraged at 80:1, nearly three times greater than Lehman Brothers when it failed.\u201d ", " In fact, the Fed has $4.5 trillion in assets, mostly Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Federal government. It has only $57 billion in equity because it sends most of its profits to the U.S. Treasury, a total of around $500 billion over the past decade. ", " And it actually has no \u201cleverage\u201d in the traditional sense of the word because it does not borrow money like Lehman Brothers did before it went bankrupt. Instead, the Fed creates money, as all central banks do. ", " \u201cThe capital of a central bank has very little importance relative to a private institution. The deposits cannot run. They are created by the central bank through asset purchases,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThere is essentially no credit risk on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet right now, and I don\u2019t know of any institution in the United States that is subject to more oversight.\u201d ", " In other words, the chances of the Fed blowing up like Lehman are nil. ", " The calculus for Paul is whether his rantings against the Fed \u2014 and his push in Congress to \u201caudit\u201d the institution \u2014 could come back to bite him should he catch fire in 2016. On many issues, Paul has fought to show that he\u2019s a different, more moderate politician than his isolationism-leaning, iconoclastic father \u2014 he\u2019s not even planning to campaign with Ron Paul. ", "JOSEPH A. CALIFANO JR.", " But the Paul camp views the \u201caudit the Fed\u201d campaign as a low-stakes way to remind the voters who propelled his father\u2019s previous presidential bids that the younger Paul is on their side, too. ", " And some Iowa political operatives say that while the push may raise concerns with the business community down the road, the issue is sufficiently obscure that Paul is not in serious danger of alienating anyone over it at this point. ", " \u201cAudit the Fed is an issue that plays to our base voters,\u201d said Steve Grubbs, a top Paul strategist in Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s been around for a number of years and it\u2019s one that\u2019s important libertarian Republicans know Sen. Paul is fully behind.\u201d ", " He added that \u201cthe core of our base [voters] are liberty voters\u201d and that \u201cour first job is to earn as much of that base vote as we can.\u201d Ron Paul won 21 percent of the vote in the 2012 Iowa caucuses. ", " Paul\u2019s legislation, which now stands its best chance ever of passing in a GOP-controlled Congress, also appears to ignore the multiple levels of audit the bank currently faces. The bank\u2019s finances are already subject to audit by the Government Accountability Office, the Fed\u2019s inspector general and outside audit firms, most recently Deloitte & Touche. Those interested in what\u2019s on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet can find out, down to the individual bond, on the website of the New York Federal Reserve. ", " Critics of the bill say it is aimed much more directly at repealing a 1978 law establishing Fed independence on monetary policy decisions. Paul\u2019s bill, though vaguely written, would likely allow the GAO to investigate monetary policy actions and report back to Congress immediately. ", " That alarms even many conservatives at the Fed who say the central bank\u2019s insulation from short-term political pressure is essential to its ability to function, especially in times of crisis like the nation faced in 2008 and 2009. ", " \u201cThe operations and finances of the board of governors and the 12 Federal Reserve banks are already audited up the wazoo,\u201d Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher, a noted conservative, thundered in a recent speech in New York. He added that the Fed already releases minutes of its policy meetings shortly after they are held, while Chair Janet Yellen faces regular news conferences and Capitol Hill questioning. ", " \u201cHaving proven themselves unable to cobble together with colleagues a working fiscal policy,\u201d Fisher added of \u201caudit the Fed\u201d proponents in Congress, \u201cthey simply find it convenient to create a boogeyman out of an entity that does its job efficiently.\u201d ", " Another element of the case against Rand Paul\u2019s view of the Fed is that his critiques of its policies threatening runaway inflation and crushing the dollar have been wrong. \u201cIf people are prepared to carry money to the grocery store in a wheel barrel, that may be coming,\u201d Paul warned on the Glenn Beck radio show in 2011. \u201cWhat I worry about is the Weimar Republic, I worry about 1923 in Germany. When they destroyed the currency, they elected Hitler. I don\u2019t want something like that to happen in our country.\u201d ", " Instead, in the ensuing years, inflation declined and the dollar strengthened to the point that it is actually damaging to U.S. exporters. And academic research shows that the more political pressure a central bank faces, the more inflation rises, the thing Paul says he worries about the most. ", " Aside from boosting his cred among libertarian voters, Paul is also using the anti-Fed campaign to raise small-dollar donations online. ", " A \u201cmoneybomb\u201d drive accompanying Paul\u2019s recent Iowa speech has raised about $90,000 so far (short of the initial $150,000 goal that the team was supposed to hit by Feb. 9, it appears, though representatives for the senator wouldn\u2019t confirm any details about the initiative, including the total money raised by the effort). They also did not respond to a request for comment on the substance of Fed experts\u2019 critiques, instead directing those questions to a pro-audit writer. ", " Matt Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa GOP, said that so far, the only people in the state who are deeply attuned to this issue are the libertarian-oriented Republicans Paul is trying to excite. ", " \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t see other Iowa Republicans following the issue close enough where that would be a liability,\u201d Strawn said. \u201cIt seems to be a safe issue that allows him to play to the home team without liability with the broader electorate.\u201d ", " While the issue may never hurt him with Iowa Republicans, it certainly will with Wall Street Republicans who are lining up heavily behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign. ", " and ", " The thinking in these circles is that should Paul emerge as a viable threat to get the nomination, an even larger outpouring of money and organizational muscle will be deployed to stop him, in large part out of fear of what a President Paul might do to the Fed. ", " \u201cIf he comes out of Iowa or begins to emerge with any kind of strength, I think you will see the GOP establishment go on red alert because they are going to view him as a dangerous person,\u201d said one financial services industry executive who did not want to be quoted on record criticizing Paul. \u201cThe Fed is the pre-eminent central bank on the planet and no one wants to put that at risk.\u201d ", " Fear of Paul emerging as a potential nominee is part of what is driving the gush of Wall Street money to Bush, and to some extent to Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. ", " \u201cHe seems to be moving to the position of abolishing or severely limiting the actions of the Fed,\u201d said Pethokoukis. \u201cEvery other advanced economy has a central bank.

", " The all-but-announced campaign manager for Hillary Clinton\u2019s all-but-certain presidential campaign has spent the past month making calls, including to many top people from President Barack Obama\u2019s two campaigns and his White House, asking for advice on whom to hire and how to run the campaign. ", "Story Continued Below", " He\u2019s nowhere near done. ", " Despite widespread assumptions that Clinton has assembled a campaign juggernaut ready to be unveiled as soon as she makes her White House run official, the reality is that she has little more than a budding operation that\u2019s far from set \u2014 either in how the jobs will be structured or who will be in them. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s a common misconception that there was some sort of campaign-in-waiting. They are building this deliberately and smartly \u2014 one piece at a time,\u201d said a Democrat familiar with the process. ", " The integration of Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s worlds will be propelled by people with both Clinton and Obama ties for the jobs of chairman (John Podesta), communications chief (Jennifer Palmieri) and campaign consultant (Jim Margolis). Mook has also been looking to Obama alumni for top press, political, field and data jobs \u2014 and not just his close friend Marlon Marshall, a Clinton 2008 staffer who later joined the Obama orbit and departed the White House late last year on what was seen as a natural trajectory toward Clinton HQ. ", " Obama loyalists who have been part of, or the subject of, hiring discussions for the campaign and advisory roles include Betsy Hoover, Obama\u2019s 2012 director of digital organizing, who could head up Clinton\u2019s digital operation. While White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz is being discussed as a later, post-primary addition, former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor, who helped the Clinton camp with June 2014\u2019s book rollout, is also frequently part of the discussions. And Yohannes Abraham, currently a top aide to Valerie Jarrett, is seen as joining the political staff. ", " Other operatives who have featured in conversations among Democrats building the campaign include first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s former communications director Kristina Schake, who is currently the chief communications officer at L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA and who is seen as headed for a deputy role on the communications team. Matt Canter, the former deputy executive director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who has no direct Obama ties, could also join down the road. ", " Obama 2012 pollster John Anzalone has been active in Clinton\u2019s circles, and two more top 2012 campaign officials \u2014 deputy campaign managers Stephanie Cutter and Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, who co-founded Precision Strategies \u2014 have also been part of the ongoing discussions for advisory roles. ", " and ", " Mook has essentially been putting markers on prospective staff to keep them accessible as he holds off on formal hires. In the meantime, he\u2019s building an operation to grapple with the unique problems a Clinton campaign poses, including reassembling the biggest network of old Democratic hands since her husband\u2019s presidency while limiting dysfunction and infighting. He also needs to keep Clinton vibrant in the midst of the least competitive non-incumbent presidential primary in decades. ", " \u201cThey\u2019re being extremely thoughtful and deliberate in their approach,\u201d said one person involved. \u201cBut it\u2019s a process, and there\u2019s a lot of work left to do.\u201d ", " Already, two themes are becoming clear: The Clinton campaign, determined to avoid the 2008 mistake of being caught unprepared for the changes in politics and campaign tactics, will rely heavily on Obama alumni to get it up to speed. And between the Obama infusion and the Clinton loyalists quickly returning to the fold, there will be few prominent slots open for up-and-coming Democratic operatives looking to break in. ", " That\u2019s created more than just anxiety that the Obama-Clinton drama of 2008 will linger \u2014 it\u2019s also created fear that a new generation of Democratic operatives will be left out of the 2016 cycle entirely. ", " The staff overlap may also complicate efforts to show a necessary distance between Clinton from Obama \u2014 and it\u2019s already sparked worries that the Clinton operation might repeat some of the Obama operation\u2019s mistakes, particularly in messaging that\u2019s often fallen short when not centered on the force of his personality. ", " The highest-ranking Obama confidant likely to enter Clinton\u2019s orbit is pollster Joel Benenson, though some see a more direct role for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina. He\u2019s the co-chair of the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, where Obama\u2019s 2012 get-out-the-vote director Buffy Wicks is now the executive director. There\u2019s also Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart, veterans of both Obama campaigns who are backing Ready for Hillary through their firm 270 Strategies. Obama\u2019s 2012 digital director Teddy Goff has also been in talks with Clinton\u2019s orbits, and he could be joined by Andrew Bleeker, an Obama online advertising strategist. ", "JOSEPH A. CALIFANO JR.", " Mook did not respond to a request for comment, and none of the potential hires \u2014 some of whom have spoken directly with Mook \u2014 would comment about their possible roles in the emerging campaign. ", " \u201cI\u2019m going to stick to my rule of no name-gaming,\u201d said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. ", " Despite the fact that few of these people have been hired for set roles, Mook\u2014the rare Democratic operative who\u2019s young and experienced but without direct Obama ties \u2014 is working to build a structure that coheres, though many figures on both sides acknowledge some tension between the two worlds remains. The presence of Mook, who was the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and campaign manager for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is a relief to many Clinton loyalists, much like Benenson\u2019s hiring was a strong sign to Obama allies of the Clinton orbits\u2019 seriousness in bringing on Obama\u2019s world. ", " \u201cJoel has been a close adviser to the president since the beginning of the campaign in 2007, so the fact that he\u2019s going on in a broader role in the Clinton campaign was a significant indicator of the level of outreach to people who worked for President Obama,\u201d said Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt. ", " The bad blood between the Obama and Clinton inner circles generated by their brutal 2008 primary battle still exists, but it doesn\u2019t appear to affect these staffers. Even among the Obama core, there\u2019s an acceptance that Clinton is more than just a quasi-incumbent Democrat to support based on party loyalty \u2014 her election would be critical to preserving much of the legacy Obama is trying to build at the end of his term through executive actions. ", " Still, some young operatives who have not spoken with Mook are griping that they will very likely miss the cycle entirely. Unlike the 2008 race, where there were so many candidates that the debate stages were packed even after Evan Bayh and Mark Warner abandoned their presidential runs early \u2014 and staff jobs abounded \u2014 a threatening challenger to Clinton has yet to emerge, and expected candidates Martin O\u2019Malley and Jim Webb have not been making comparable hiring inquiries. ", " With Clinton putting off her launch for months, the people who are looking to lock down their paychecks are getting antsy. ", " \u201cPeople thought she\u2019d launch a PAC, start staffing up in a big way, and launch in January, February or March,\u201d said one Democratic operative who worked for Clinton in 2008 and Obama in 2012. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anywhere for the nervous energy to go. And it\u2019s not just that, people want to start working. The people who want to start working for Hillary are pretty well established, but [others] aren\u2019t couch-surfing waiting for that job.\u201d ", " Republicans have used the lull to develop a line of attack that Clinton is \u201chiding,\u201d even as they continue to seed the attack lines of an \u201cObama-Clinton economy\u201d or \u201cObama-Clinton foreign policy.\u201d ", " While such criticisms mount, Clinton allies are fine with her operation keeping quiet \u2014 for now. ", " \u201cThe lack of a significant challenger in the primary buys the Clinton campaign some time to focus on building out a grass-roots organization and fundraising, and gives them a longer runway to get the plane in the air,\u201d LaBolt said. \u201cBut they will have to deal with Republicans who are out at red-meat events, guns blazing, who will be attacking the campaign and the Democratic Party each and every day.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Several Democrats have previously said they would support the legislation, but now that Obama can argue he\u2019s made progress, Democrats will have to decide whether they want to openly rebuke the administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts. ", " The new top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland, sounded like he was still making up his mind. He said he was open to moving forward, but cautioned he needs to study how legislation written by Sen.

With Congress in the middle of a recess, both Corker and the White House will be gauging support for the bill, which Corker intends to take up in committee on April 14. ", " To win a veto-proof majority, Corker will have to reassure Cardin and fend off White House pressure on Democrats to hold off on voting for Iran legislation. ", " Other Democrats, like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), reemphasized their support for legislation even in the wake of the historic announcement, calling the Corker measure one that \u201csets up a clear and constructive process for Congress to weigh in on any final deal that touches upon the statutory sanctions Congress has enacted.\u201d ", "CHARLES DUELFER", " Obama challenged lawmakers preemptively in his Thursday speech, asking whether a verifiable deal with Iran \u201cis a worse option than another war in the Middle East.\u201d ", " \u201cIf Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it\u2019s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy, international unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen,\u201d Obama added.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) got a phone call from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power urging him to keep an open mind, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) got a telephone briefing from Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Obama himself called Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and said he\u2019d soon be in contact with other congressional leaders, including Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ", " Many Republicans won\u2019t be swayed. Johnson said he was trying to keep an open mind but also suggested that Corker\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t go far enough, suggesting instead that Congress should declare the nuclear deal a treaty that must be ratified by the Senate. ", " \u201cWe could have a very simple bill that basically says, that no matter what President Obama says, we are going to call this a treaty and we are going to ratify this as a treaty,\u201d Johnson said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about the complexity of Corker\u2019s bill. ", " Many of Johnson\u2019s colleagues went straight into the blistering criticisms, summoning their choicest rhetoric to pan Obama\u2019s negotiating acumen after railing against the ongoing negotiations for months. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said no agreement was struck, describing Thursday\u2019s announcement as simply a \u201clist of dangerous concessions.\u201d ", " and ", " And in a telephone interview, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) reiterated that his leaders should give his sanctions bill a vote and blasted the president\u2019s announcement and a top State Department negotiator, Wendy Sherman.

Jeb Bush said in a statement. \u201cI cannot stand behind such a flawed agreement.\u201d ", " Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, was more critical, saying the agreement \u201crewards an enemy, undermines our allies and threatens our safety.\u201d And Sen. Marco Rubio called it \u201cjust the latest example of this administration\u2019s farcical approach to Iran.\u201d ", " The main event, though, will be courting Democrats. And some aren\u2019t inclined to support Corker. Murphy said that as long as the president\u2019s negotiators are telling him that Iran votes would scuttle negotiations, he will hold off on supporting congressional approval legislation. ", " \u201cCorker\u2019s desire to move his bill exists independent of the contents of the deal. Bob just believes he\u2019s got to pass this bill. I disagree,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMy feelings about the Corker proposal are completely interdependent on the level of concern from our negotiators.\u201d ", " Indeed, with the framework in hand and some members like Murphy already satisfied with giving the administration room and time to negotiate, Obama\u2019s outreach will focus on Democrats who have signaled support for either Corker\u2019s bill or one that would snap sanctions back on Iran if it reneges on any part of an agreement. ", " But on-the-fence Democrats are also waiting for a signal from leaders in Tehran. Will Iran step forward and publicly embrace Obama\u2019s description of an agreement that would pull apart two-thirds of the country\u2019s centrifuges? And will Iran accept the president\u2019s claim that the deal prevents Tehran from making a nuclear weapon? ", " That, said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), is the sticking point. ", " \u201cIf the Iranians do not publicly agree to what the president says they\u2019ve agreed to, then I\u2019m ready to vote for both bills,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cIf Iran cares what Congress does, the first step is to publicly agree to what the president puts out.\u201d ", " The White House has repeatedly lobbied Democrats away from supporting either bill on the Senate floor, and as McConnell prepares his chamber to vote on Corker\u2019s bill, Obama and his aides are moving quickly to stifle Democratic support. The White House is less worried about members like Murphy and Reid, and instead will concentrate on members like Cardin and Democratic-leader-in-waiting Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who\u2019s a co-sponsor of Corker\u2019s bill and Kirk\u2019s sanctions legislation. ", " Schumer didn\u2019t tip his hand on Thursday.

The same agency dropped the state\u2019s credit rating three times in the past year, meaning it has lowered New Jersey\u2019s rating a total of six times since the start of Christie\u2019s tenure.

Stephen Sweeney said he would start a \u201cbig fight\u201d against the decision and rating agencies dropped the city\u2019s credit rating and said an emergency manager was a negative for all of the state\u2019s municipalities.

", " Furthermore, emergency managers are often synonymous with budget cuts and broken cities. Think Detroit. ", " The politics could cut two ways, analysts say. ", " Christie could win praise for making tough calls to save Atlantic City. Or it could just be another reminder of the state\u2019s many problems under his watch. ", " \u201cTo me, it just bolsters [Christie\u2019s] image of making tough decisions and demonstrating leadership,\u201d Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist and president at Potomac Strategy Group, said. But Mackowiak and others said Atlantic City also presents \u201ca real political problem\u201d for the governor. ", " The city\u2019s woes are mounting. Four of its 12 casinos closed in 2014, leaving many Atlantic City residents unemployed. A rising unemployment rate \u2014 17.8 percent \u2014 is hurting the state\u2019s ability to lower its own rate. New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate of 6.2 percent is above the 5.7 percent national average. Atlantic City also has a public safety problem: Its violent crime levels are among the highest in New Jersey. ", " The city\u2019s contribution to state coffers is also dropping fast, a tough hit for a state already facing its own financial crisis. All these problems give other 2016 candidates plenty of ammunition against Christie. ", " Atlantic City\u2019s problems started several years ago when it lost control of its gaming monopoly on the East Coast. Pennsylvania legalized gambling in 2004, and the new casinos stole Atlantic City\u2019s vacationers and tourism revenue. ", " The Atlantic City Governor\u2019s Commission\u2019s report showed that casino revenues dropped from $4.9 billion in 2006 to $2.9 billion in 2013, and the report cited competition from new casinos as a main driver. ", " The blow\u2019s financial impact was exacerbated by the financial crisis and subsequent recession, and Hurricane Sandy destroying a large amount of Atlantic City\u2019s boardwalk. ", " The battle for tourists is only going to get worse. ", " Earlier this year, New York said it was going to open three casinos, and murmurs about a new casino in northern New Jersey around the Meadowlands in Bergen County began over the summer. ", " \u201cAtlantic City\u2019s economy is all built on gaming, and when that industry goes away, when a competitor opens in your backyard, that can be devastating to the local economy as well as [to local] property taxes,\u201d Tracy Gordon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Tax Policy Center, said. ", " The impact on taxes is crucial, because Atlantic City gets almost all its cash from property taxes, accounting for 81 percent of its revenue in fiscal 2014. ", " Casinos have paid 75 percent of the city\u2019s property taxes until recently, according to Michael Stinson, director of revenue and finance for Atlantic City. He said less than 60 percent of Atlantic City\u2019s property tax revenue now comes from casinos, and he estimates it will fall to below 50 percent soon. ", " One major impact of the casino closings is a shift in the property tax base, from Atlantic City business owners to residents, many of whom lost their jobs when the casinos began closing.

The government has never told us about this. In fact, in some cases they told us they looked through [Clinton\u2019s] office and there was nothing to be found.\u201d ", " Fitton said his group is preparing to make legal moves to be certain that its demands for information were properly handled and to examine assurances the State Department gave to judges in the group\u2019s lawsuits.

But that would highlight the fact that Clinton\u2019s own aides and lawyers determined which records were work-related. ", " At a daily State briefing Tuesday, Harf faced repeated questions from journalists about why the department was taking Clinton\u2019s word about which emails were official. One journalist even quoted President Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous saying about the Soviets, \u201cTrust but verify.\u201d ", " \u201cAll I can say is that we reached out to the former secretaries and asked them to provide any records that needed to be preserved,\u201d Harf replied, adding that Clinton \u201cwas the only former secretary that responded to our request and sent back those tens of thousands of pages of documents.\u201d ", " \u201cI think 55,000 is a pretty big number,\u201d she said as reporters reacted skeptically to the completeness of the handover by the former secretary. ", " Two former State Department officials said Tuesday that they were surprised that archival questions about Clinton\u2019s work-related emails were not addressed either when she assumed the job in 2009 or when she left in 2013. They expected such arrangements would have been put in place by Patrick Kennedy, State\u2019s assistant secretary for administration, as Clinton returned to private life.

Bush\u2019s remarks, and his chatting afterwards, left many attendees convinced he was preparing to run for president. Word of Bush\u2019s interest ricocheted around the political world. ", " But Bush, a private citizen for eight years since leaving the Florida governor\u2019s mansion, had no real infrastructure to handle such an endeavor. And as the third member of a storied political family to seek the presidency, just five years after his brother left office with near record-low approval ratings, he had no clear message or answer to the inevitable questions about why he was the right man for 2016. \u201cHe just got way out there beyond his capacity to manage and he consciously decided to take his profile down while thinking through how to make a run,\u201d one friend said. ", "Story Continued Below", " So while even close Bush watchers began to doubt whether he was really serious about running, he and a close-knit group of advisers were following a careful plan aimed at maximizing his chances of winning the nomination, if and when he gave the thumbs-up. ", " Their strategy was to publicly downplay his interest in the race and avoid media attention, while quietly laying the groundwork for a launch that would catch much of Washington \u2014 and many of his potential rivals \u2014 flat-footed. While the much of the political world focused on Chris Christie, Rand Paul and even Bush\u2019s fellow Floridian Marco Rubio, Bush was quietly collecting political chits, developing a cohesive platform, and preparing for a fundraising blitz intended to grab the front-runner\u2019s chair, scare potential competitors like Mitt Romney and Christie, and put Bush on such a firm financial footing that he could devote more time to retail politics when it really counted. ", " Bush\u2019s first step, after that November date at the Marriott Marquis, was to hire full-time help. Within a month, he had dipped into his personal fortune to hire four staffers: longtime adviser and former chief of staff Sally Bradshaw, former spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, longtime aide Brandi Brown and political aide Josh Venable. Bush\u2019s political consultant, Mike Murphy, joined in conference calls from his California home. ", " Bradshaw describes the following year as a \u201cprocess\u201d in which staffers carefully set up the building blocks for a massive campaign, while the would-be candidate engaged in his own soul-searching under the radar screen. Even unscripted moments like his mother\u2019s declaration in January 2014 that she hoped he wouldn\u2019t run helped serve his purposes \u2014 allowing the family to acknowledge the audacity of a third Bush presidency while masking Bush\u2019s preparations. ", " \u201cWe just do what people who work for Jeb Bush always do, which is build the plan, execute the plan and don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Bradshaw said. ", " In keeping with that line, Bradshaw didn\u2019t provide the specifics of the \u201cplan,\u201d although she indicated it was more a series of dos and don\u2019ts for 2014. ", " Do: Travel, fund-raise for other candidates, quietly vet Bush\u2019s business dealings and other potential points of attack, and entertain calls from supporters to run.

", " \u201cDonors called me all the time. I didn\u2019t go to donors and solicit their support,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cIf a donor called and said \u2018Is Jeb Bush running?\u2019 I would say \u2018I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s going through a process of thinking very seriously about this. What do you think he should do?\u2019\u201d ", " If the donor responded, \u201cWell, I think he should run,\u201d Bradshaw said she\u2019d reply: \u201cLet\u2019s get all of your contact information.\u201d ", " Bradshaw added that she had no idea what Bush\u2019s ultimate decision would be, but she collected donor information as a safeguard in case Bush took the next step.

", " \u201cAll that matters in this first quarter is fundraising,\u201d said Reed. \u201cNobody else has done what he has done.\u201d ", " Indeed, by the end of the quarter, Bush\u2019s team believes, many would-be competitors will have joined Romney on the sidelines, unwilling or unable to compete with the Bush juggernaut, while the candidate can be freed up to address the many serious questions about why another Bush is the best solution to the nation\u2019s problems. ", " * * * ", " The confidence with which Bush is pursuing his strategy was evident last Wednesday in the Picasso-adorned Park Avenue home of private-equity titan Henry Kravis. It was Bush\u2019s 62nd birthday, and he celebrated in Kravis\u2019 26-room penthouse with more than 40 of the richest people in New York. Among them were Bush\u2019s cousin, George Walker IV, the chief executive of the investment management firm of Neuberger Berman, and real estate mogul Jerry Speyer, along with Ken Mehlman and Alex Navab of Kravis\u2019 firm, KKR. The admission price: a minimum of $100,000, also the going rate for other Bush fundraisers.

The money he collected would pay for time later in the campaign that he could devote to grassroots campaigning. ", " As it turns out, Kravis\u2019 $4 million haul has led to a donor arms race with Coral Gables billionaire Miguel \u201cMike\u201d Fernandez, who wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO that he intends to raise $5 million at a fundraiser next week at his waterfront mansion.

That has left Clinton, a defense-minded politician who coined the term \u201cWar Room,\u201d without a rapid response team to offer robust explanations to reporters probing the fundraising and management practices of her family\u2019s foundation \u2014 or even to muster an organized corps of surrogates to get out the talking points.

", " Democratic pollster and longtime Obama adviser Joel Benenson has been tasked with assembling Clinton\u2019s media team, which, once a campaign is officially launched, will be headed by current White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri. Veteran Democratic operative Brian Fallon is likely in line for the critical job of rapid response director, according to several party sources. One problem is that Fallon has a pretty demanding day job that hinders him from even advising Clinton informally: He\u2019s currently a senior aide to Attorney General Eric Holder and will likely remain at his post until Holder\u2019s replacement, Loretta Lynch, is confirmed by the Senate. ", " That has left the task of defending the former secretary of state \u2014 and her family \u2014 to a small corps of well-regarded, loyal and badly overstretched aides who have been forced to deal with an avalanche of requests about the foundation, starting with reports that officials solicited millions in donations from foreign governments. Clinton\u2019s personal spokesman Nick Merrill, for example, declined to comment for this story.

There\u2019s just no sense of keeping this game going on.\u201d ", " Clinton has often relied on an array of groups led by GOP nemesis-turned-ally David Brock for her pre-campaign defense, but the foundation stories, broken by mainstream media outlets after months of diligent reporting, don\u2019t lend themselves to easy pushback. ", " Attempts by Clinton\u2019s tiny personal PR staff have been less than effective.

As soon as she opens her mouth, she starts saying stupid stuff.\u201d ", " Clinton allies see her as a politician with such high name recognition that it is unlikely Republicans can define her anew in voters\u2019 eyes, and they consider the next three weeks to be the homestretch of the pre-candidate\u2019s pre-campaign.

On Tuesday, she is set to accept an award in Washington from EMILY\u2019s List, a political group that supports female Democrats and which is strongly behind her White House bid. And on Wednesday, she will appear at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s annual gala.

She will be inducted to Irish America magazine\u2019s hall of fame on March 16 in Manhattan and will speak to the American Camp Association\u2019s New York and New Jersey conference in Atlantic City on the 19th.

Clinton needed time to start hiring her team and to build her campaign\u2019s opening argument, they say nearly five months after Plouffe visited Clinton\u2019s Washington home on Whitehaven Street urging her to hurry up. They note that Clinton\u2019s lack of serious Democratic competitors helped her move deliberately while Republicans sped ahead with the process of hiring staff and crafting campaign messages.

The World Series.\u201d ", " Some in Clinton\u2019s orbit also have noted the early campaign struggles of Republican Jeb Bush, who surprised the political world by stepping toward a run in December. Bush later had to get rid of his PAC\u2019s chief technology officer within a day after insensitive tweets were uncovered, and the Bush campaign also accidentally published Floridians\u2019 Social Security numbers and other personal information online. ", " Despite the fact that Bush continues to lead his party\u2019s pack and steamroll its donor class, one operative close to Clinton\u2019s team said such costly mistakes came because Bush had not taken the time to properly prepare himself for a modern, full-scale campaign.

", " \u201cThey are about to make a mistake for the ages,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said last week. ", "Story Continued Below", " Negotiators, critics and outside experts will be closely watching six key areas of concern. The success or failure of Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy initiative could hinge on how the final agreement addresses them. ", " Secretary of State John Kerry and negotiators from five other countries \u2014 France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia \u2014 are in Switzerland this weekend trying to reach a framework agreement by March 31 that would set the basic outlines of a much longer-term deal. The main goal is to ensure that Iran can\u2019t develop a nuclear weapon faster than the outside world could stop it. ", "SIMOND DEGALBERT", " Such a framework would leave technical details to be nailed down before June 30. That is the only truly binding deadline on negotiators, because it is the expiration date for the current interim agreement that has capped Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for limited sanctions relief. Negotiators see March 31 as a political deadline established mainly so the Obama administration can show evidence of progress to impatient members of Congress. ", " If there\u2019s no deal by Tuesday, there\u2019s no practical reason the United States and its partners couldn\u2019t keep negotiating. In practice, the real deadline of concern for the Obama White House is April 13, when the Senate is scheduled to return from its Easter recess \u2014 and will likely take up legislation cracking down on Iran if a framework is not in hand. ", " These are six of the core issues that any agreement in the coming days will need to address, and which both supporters and critics will be scrutinizing to see who got the better end of the deal: ", " ", "U.S. officials say their guiding star is to make Iran unable to acquire a nuclear bomb in less than one year. That\u2019s enough time, the thinking goes, for the international community to detect any Iranian move to build a weapon and to respond with economic sanctions and possible military action. Some think Iran may now have a \u201cbreakout time,\u201d as the experts call it, of as little as three to six months. ", " But critics of the deal, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, think one year isn\u2019t long enough. Any deal that produces a longer breakout time \u2014 of, say, 18 months \u2014 would be much easier for Obama to sell at home and abroad. But few observers expect that to happen. ", " And not everyone is sure to agree on the breakout time established by the provisions of a deal, which depends in part on complex technical calculations. When he spoke to Congress in early March, Netanyahu hinted that Israeli nuclear experts believe the deal would leave Iran less than one year away from developing a bomb. ", " ", "Iran currently possesses about 20,000 centrifuges, which spin uranium at extremely high speeds to increase its purity \u2014 potentially high enough to make a nuclear bomb \u2014 but it operates only 10,000 of them. When the nuclear talks first began in late 2013, Obama officials spoke of letting Iran run a couple of thousand centrifuges. Netanyahu says the number should be zero. According to recent reports, the U.S. is now offering to let Iran operate around 6,500 centrifuges. ", " and ", " The centrifuge number is of limited value in isolation because there are so many other factors behind a nuclear deal. \u201cCentrifuges are just one factor in the equation,\u201d writes Joe Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund and a supporter of the nuclear talks. But news headlines and critics are likely to focus on that factor because it is the simplest metric in the talks. Any figure below around 6,000 will be seen as a win for Obama; any figure above 7,000 as a concession to Iran. ", " Deal-watchers will also be looking closely to see how much research and development Iran is allowed to conduct into more advanced and efficient centrifuge designs, which could turbocharge its nuclear program in future years. ", " ", "A nuclear deal will almost certainly limit the level to which Iran can enrich its uranium \u2014 allowing Iran to produce uranium potent enough to fuel a nuclear reactor but not a bomb. (Think of whipping cream: The uranium is the cream, and the centrifuges are the whisks. Iran will, in effect, be forced to stop whipping before the cream is fluffy.) ", " Iran will also likely be required to ship much of its nuclear material out of the country, probably to Russia, so that it can\u2019t be diverted to a potential bomb. Any material it does keep will likely be limited to an enrichment level of 5 percent \u2014 well below the 90 percent enrichment level required to achieve a nuclear blast. ", " ", " The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran has refused to answer several questions about its alleged past research into nuclear weapons design. Iran denies that it ever conducted that research, but Western officials and the IAEA are dubious. A key question is whether a deal would require Iran to answer all of the IAEA\u2019s questions immediately. Many Republicans and some Democrats in Congress insist that it must. ", " Skeptics will also be watching closely to see what degree of monitoring and inspection Iran will be forced to accept to ensure that it doesn\u2019t cheat on any deal. \u201cIran will need to allow mechanisms to ensure that any further military nuclear-related work would be detected on short order,\u201d David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in November. \u201cWithout these limitations on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs and expanded verification conditions, a long-term deal will likely fail or exacerbate the threat from Iran.\u201d ", " The more information Iran provides about its past military research, and the more transparent it is about its future activities, the more it will reassure wavering U.S. allies and members of Congress. ", " ", " A central question is how long any nuclear deal will last. Obama administration officials have set one decade as the minimum duration, down from the 20 years some floated early in the talks. Critics say that\u2019s not enough time. French officials have been pushing for a 15-year deal, while Netanyahu says there should be no expiration date at all \u2014 the Israeli leader wants Iran freed from nuclear limits only when its theocratic regime stops threatening Israel and other countries in the region. ", " \u201cWe can insist that restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world,\u201d Netanyahu said in his March 3 address to Congress. That\u2019s not going to happen. But a sunset date of longer than a decade would be a win for Obama, making a deal easier to defend. ", " ", " How many sanctions are lifted, and how quickly, will be a key measure of any deal. Iran came to the bargaining table in 2013 only after its economy had been crushed by harsh U.S. and United Nations sanctions. Iran has called for all sanctions to be lifted immediately. The United States insists upon a much slower pace, with most sanctions removed over time as Iran shows it\u2019s honoring a deal. ", " The reality will be in the middle. But the longer sanctions endure, and the more requirements for their removal, the more palatable the deal will be to critics. And if reports are accurate that Iran has been promised immediate relief from United Nations sanctions, Congress is likely to fight back hard. Graham has called for cutting off U.S. funding to the United Nations if that happens. And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz told CNN that it \u201cdramatically increases the likelihood that a new president in 2017 will face no other choice but launching military strikes against Iran to stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

I have every confidence we\u2019ll meet the deadline one way or the other.\u201d ", " After weeks of wrangling, the impasse remains unchanged: The GOP base and many Republicans in Congress insist that any DHS bill must target Obama\u2019s unilateral actions on immigration. But Senate Democrats have repeatedly filibustered that proposal three times, demanding a bill free of immigration riders. ", " The GOP is praying that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have a solution, but meanwhile Republicans are spending much of their energy trying to blame the Democrats for any shutdown. A diverse group of Republicans \u2014 representing conservatives and leadership \u2014 sounded that theme during 35 minutes of zingers at a Thursday news conference. ", " Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a conservative immigration hardliner, insisted that Democrats will abandon their filibuster as the funding deadline draws near \u2014 even though Democratic sources say that will not happen. ", " \u201cFeb. 27 midnight, that\u2019s the witching hour,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cThat will be down at the end of what we could accurately characterize as \u2018hell week.\u2019 After this [recess], it\u2019s an entirely different vote for those six or so Senate Democrats. The closer it gets, the clearer they will think.\u201d ", " But as the party that controls both chambers of Congress, Republicans appear likely to take the lion\u2019s share of the blame if the funding spigot shuts off for an agency so crucial to national security. A shutdown would force furloughs for about 30,000 DHS workers, Secretary Jeh Johnson warned this week. The department\u2019s approximately 200,000 other employees would continue to work, though most without pay. ", " and ", " Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) said it\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d for some Republicans to advocate a funding lapse and then blame the Democrats if the department shuts down. He had said in January, during the House and Senate joint Republican retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania, that he would vote for a clean DHS bill with no immigration language. ", " \u201cRepublicans and Democrats have to work together and especially never take a chance on having our national security at risk,\u201d Denham said this week. ", " A small minority of congressional Republicans have called for their party to take the political heat from their own base and vote for a clean funding bill \u2014 a GOP cave on immigration. Such a measure would fund the department through September and would avoid the trap of a short-term extension that just prolongs the fight. ", " \u201cCan you take a straight answer?\u201d asked Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). \u201cI think we should just pass a clean DHS bill and fund the department.\u201d ", " But this suggestion is not yet popular among Republicans, some of whom are seeking their own way out of the jam. Some Republicans have proposed narrowing the GOP\u2019s response \u2014 for instance, by focusing their attack just on the most recent immigration actions that Obama announced in November. That would leave intact a narrower directive Obama issued in 2012 to protect young undocumented immigrants. ", " But that idea instantly fell flat among Democrats. ", " Another option offered by moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is for the House to separate the immigration provisions and the underlying funding bill and send them in tandem to the Senate, which would reject the riders and probably approve the funding portion. But that might not placate conservatives. ", " Some Republicans also hope that a ruling in a lawsuit, led by Texas, against the executive actions could give the GOP a way out. If the courts find that Obama\u2019s actions are unconstitutional, that may take the legislative fight off the table, Collins said. ", " While Collins and many of her colleagues have pursued bipartisan deal-making on domestic policy, simply bowing to Democrats is not on the docket this time around. They say the president has gone too far. ", " \u201cWe need to resolve it,\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) said. \u201cWe need to fund DHS and also find a legislative mechanism to express our disapproval with the president\u2019s executive order.\u201d ", " The problem for Republicans is that Senate Democrats will block the DHS bill as long as it contains any immigration provisions. Democrats also reject the notion that they would share the blame for a funding lapse. ", " \u201cThey\u2019re in charge,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) of the Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019re responsible.\u201d ", " With no room between the two parties for compromise, the upshot is that Homeland Security really could fall off the cliff. Even if the House passes a short-term funding bill immediately before the Feb. 27 deadline, any Republican senator who thinks the GOP is capitulating could throw sand in the gears and delay it past the zero hour. ", " \u201cAs much as both sides don\u2019t want [a funding lapse] to happen, I think that it is always a possibility,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a conservative member who has agitated for this confrontation. ", " But most Republicans don\u2019t want to entertain that possibility. Surely, they say, someone must have a plan locked in a box somewhere. ", " \u201cThe leadership will be responsible and find a solution so we don\u2019t have a shutdown,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.). ", " But he didn\u2019t know what that solution would entail \u2014 and at this point nobody else seems to, either. ", " \u201cAt this stage,\u201d said Rep.

That, and I\u2019m quoting here, \u201cThere is no evidence of that with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d The Washington Post and The Guardian said the same thing in their stories.

", " \u2022 The Clinton Foundation is constantly re-evaluating its practices to ensure it runs as efficiently, effectively, and as transparently as possible. And it has said it will re-evaluate its contributor practices if Secretary Clinton runs, just as was done when she became Secretary of State. ", " \u2022 The bottom line: The ability to fund the Foundation is the ability to improve the lives of millions of people across the world. And while it\u2019s appropriate to raise questions to ensure that money is being used as efficiently as possible to achieve its mission, it\u2019s just as important to acknowledge that after much scrutiny, and when you cast aside those whose goal it is to make political hay, that this is a philanthropy, widely recognized as a successful one, and it does an enormous amount of good that the people who founded it and work there should be nothing but immensely proud of. Period. ", " Additional Points ", " \u2022 Almost all charities depend on outside support whether it\u2019s your local non-profit one or a global philanthropy. ", " \u2022 The work of the Clinton Foundation is effective, which is why it has bipartisan support from places like News Corporation, Chris Ruddy of NewsMax, and counts among its contributors and CGI participants President George H.W. Bush, Laura Bush, Condi Rice, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Carly Fiorina, and dozens of governors and mayors from both sides of the aisle. ", " \u2022 Every penny of the money Algeria donated for Haiti went to help Haiti. People forget about the outpouring of support for those debased by the earthquake and the need to get money and supplies there quickly. The United Nations asked President Clinton to head Haiti relief and encouraged countries to support the effort. President Bush partnered with WJC to set up the Bush-Clinton Haiti Fund in part because the Clinton Foundation had an expertise in addressing such challenges efficiently and effectively - as they previously did with the Tsunami is SE Asia. ", " \u2022 People are trying to make this political forget the human toll of HIV/AIDs or earthquakes or that as governments have fewer resources around the world. That\u2019s exactly where NGO\u2019s need to step into the void to help improve people\u2019s lives. When people call for the donations to be returned, they are dismissing the fact that lives will be affected, even lost. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Bush. ", " But Jeffrey, like most others with direct dealings with Iran, warned that getting Iran\u2019s radical clerics to implement a deal will be even more difficult than reaching one in the first place. ", " Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan in 2002, had a similar reaction. He said he had high hopes when diplomats from Iran, including its current foreign minister, pledged to support the new Afghan government. ", " But he quickly learned that other elements of the Iranian regime were working, as he put it, \u201cexactly in the opposite direction\u201d with Afghan factions to undermine it.

", " and ", " But despite the apparent progress toward reaching a deal \u2014 one that would prevent Iran from enriching uranium for at least a decade \u2014 there remain deep doubts among longtime Iran hands that any deal will be viable unless Iran can narrow its own deep divisions. ", " Former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, who first consulted with Iranian counterparts in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, said the biggest obstacle to negotiations is that\u2019s it\u2019s been unclear whether Iran really wants a deal. ", " He likened the negotiations to the talks he held with representatives from Tehran when he was the top U.S. diplomat in Iraq in 2007 and tried to get them to stop supporting Shia militias who were killing U.S. troops and their Iraqi allies. ", " \u201cThe Iranians said, \u2018We are absolutely not supporting Shia militias.\u2019 We said, \u2018You can stop doing it and say you never did it and that would be fine with us,\u2019\u201d Crocker recalled. \u201cHere, they say they are making no effort to develop nuclear weapons. Then our terms should be acceptable to them.\u201d ", " He believes a viable deal in Switzerland is possible only \u201cif the Iranians in fact do not want a nuclear weapon. That is unclear.\u201d ", " Back in Iraq, he recalled, it was clear \u201cthere was simply no way the Iranians could be negotiated out of their support for anti-coalition and anti-Iraq-government militias.\u201d ", " Those attacks were also blamed on the Quds force, the shadowy arm of the Shia Islam theocracy that has also been fingered for exporting terrorism around the world \u2014 including through Palestinian terrorist groups and its proxies Hezbollah in Lebanon and President Bashar Assad in Syria \u2014 and currently is supporting a Shia rebellion in Yemen. ", " \u201cThe Quds force does the things we detest around the world,\u201d said retired Adm. William Fallon, who was the senior U.S. military commander in the Middle East in 2007 to 2008. He believes the group is now more influential than ever in dictating Iranian foreign policy. ", " \u201cThey have gotten themselves into every aspect of the country \u2014 business, corruption, the military,\u201d added Fallon, who helped train Iranian pilots before the 1979 Islamic revolution. \u201cThe Quds force has not been a force for good.\u201d ", " Indeed, as Jeffrey used intermediaries to again reach out to Iranian officials in Baghdad in 2011, he had the same experience as Khalilzad did in Kabul. ", " \u201cI dealt with them indirectly, extensively, in 2010 and 2011 on the political future of Iraq,\u201d said Jeffrey, who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ", " He recalled his expectations that some common ground might be found were snuffed out \u201cbecause of their own idiocy, plotting to bomb Cafe Milano,\u201d he said, referring to the reported Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington at the Georgetown restaurant. ", " \u201cThe question is, \u2018Is Iran a state, or is Iran a cause?\u2019\u201d Jeffrey added, saying he believes it\u2019s the latter. \u201cIt is extremely difficult to deal with these people\u201d if you are dealing with a state that is also a cause. \u201cFrom Cafe Milano to Syria to Yemen \u2014 it is not doing all that to get attention so that we will treat it better as a state. It is what it is designed to do.\u201d ", " While the bombast does not translate to its diplomats, those with direct knowledge say the duplicity does. ", "ZACHARY KARABELL", " Gary Samore, one of the chief U.S. negotiators on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in Obama\u2019s first term, was first sought out by Iranian diplomats in London in 2003, when they feared the then-Bush administration might attack it militarily, and he traveled there in 2005 to meet with top political leaders. ", " \u201cThe Iranians are incredibly sophisticated and good negotiators,\u201d said Samore, who is now executive director for research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. \u201cThey are very, very shrewd and sneaky negotiators, whether it is buying oranges or rugs or centrifuges. The Iranians have a reputation for duplicity, and this is in a region where duplicity is well-practiced art.\u201d ", " For example, he cited the recent announcement that Iran would not be willing to ship out of the country its large supply of low enriched uranium to help convince the international community it was not stockpiling material for a weapons program. ", " \u201cThey led us to believe they were willing to allow most of the LEU to be shipped to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey reneged on that.\u201d ", " They hold differing opinions, however, on whether more sanctions, as some hawkish members of Congress are proposing, would get Iran to make more concessions or increase the likelihood that Tehran would live up to to any resulting pact. ", " While Khalizad said he believes more sanctions now might lead to a better deal, Fallon doubts it. ", " \u201cLet\u2019s get a reality check here,\u201d said Fallon, whose tenure coincided with a spike in attacks on American troops by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cWe could impose sanctions upon sanctions upon sanctions. Anybody who thinks doing more sanctions is going to change behavior is dreaming, in my book. The leadership finds out a way to neutralize them.\u201d ", " Khalizad said he believes more sanctions now might result in a better deal. And Jeffrey believes they might have more effect, but \u201conly if they have international support,\u201d including punishing third-country banks that do business with Iran. ", " But Fallon doubts more sanctions would matter. ", " Even common ground might be found with the feared Quds force, suggested Crocker, who was also ambassador in both Iraq and Afghanistan in the Bush administration and held unofficial discussions over the future of Afghanistan. ", " \u201cThere was an initial period that lasted from 9/11 to the State of the Union in [January] 2002 when elements, including the Quds force, were interested in where things might go with us,\u201d he recalled. ", " \u201cWe both hated the Taliban,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cThey were strongly supportive of U.S. military action and were impatient. They really wanted it sooner. We agreed on a post-Taliban political structure. That in essence was an Iranian-U.S. agreement. We had already started talking about other issues \u2014 Lebanon, Hezbollah, Iraq.\u201d ", " But then it all changed when Bush labeled Iraq, Iran and North Korea an \u201caxis of evil\u201d \u2014 to Crocker\u2019s surprise. ", " \u201cI was shaken awake by staff members out in Kabul,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOne of them said, \u2018Boss, you are really not going to like this.\u2019\u201d ", " \u201cWe dealt with concrete issues and made some progress, and then the axis of evil happened,\u201d he added. \u201cIt did not end the negotiations, but they were never quite the same after that.\u201d ", " While many longtime Iran hands agree that there is little hope that this time around will yield a different result, most agree that there is little choice but to keep trying. ", " Fallon made the analogy of negotiations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. ", " \u201cWe made some deals neither of us wanted to make,\u201d he said. And just because Iran similarly can\u2019t be trusted, he added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you ought to forget it.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Braverman, who had worked with Chelsea Clinton at the prestigious McKinsey & Company consultancy, had been brought in with the former first daughter\u2019s support to help impose McKinsey-like management rigor to a foundation that had grown into a $2 billion charitable powerhouse.\u00a0 ", " But in January, only weeks after the board's show of support and just a year and a half after Braverman arrived, he abruptly resigned, and sources tell\u00a0 ", " his exit stemmed partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation. Some, including the president\u2019s old Arkansas lawyer Bruce Lindsey, who preceded Braverman as CEO, raised concerns directly to Bill Clinton about the reforms implemented by Braverman, according to sources, and felt themselves marginalized by the growing influence of Chelsea Clinton and the new CEO she had helped recruit.\u00a0 ", "Story Continued Below", " The previously untold saga of Braverman\u2019s brief, and occasionally fraught tenure trying to navigate the Clintons\u2019 insular world highlights the challenges the family has faced trying to impose rigorous oversight onto a vast global foundation that relies on some of the same loyal megadonors Hillary Clinton will need for the presidential run sources have said she is all but certain to launch later this year. ", " Already, a spate of recent news stories in\u00a0 ", "\u00a0and elsewhere have highlighted questions about the foundation\u2019s aggressive fundraising both before and during Braverman\u2019s tenure, including the\u00a0 ", "\u00a0that the foundation had been accepting contributions from foreign governments with\u00a0 ", "from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The foundation has been Clinton\u2019s main public platform since she left State in February 2013.\u00a0 ", " The hiring a few months later of Braverman, who had been a partner in McKinsey\u2019s Washington office, was seen as validation of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s view that the foundation needed to address recommendations from a 2011 audit for tighter governance and budgeting, as well as more comprehensive policies to vet donors and avoid conflicts of interest.\u00a0 ", " When Braverman arrived to replace Lindsey as CEO, he moved quickly to adopt the auditor\u2019s recommendations, and then some. He diversified the foundation\u2019s board beyond the Clintons and their longtime political allies and restructured its finance department. He oversaw the creation of a $250 million endowment and implemented data-driven analytics to measure the effectiveness of foundation programs.\u00a0 ", " No public explanation was offered for Braverman\u2019s resignation.\u00a0 ", " But sources say Braverman\u2019s modernization efforts were hampered by the occasionally conflicting visions of the three Clintons, and their rival staff factions. Some told Braverman, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how this place works,\u201d while others\u2014including Lindsey\u2014second-guessed Braverman to Bill Clinton, according to sources familiar with the situation. They said a repeated refrain from the old guard was that Braverman was in it for his own glory. ", " Braverman referred requests for comment to the foundation.\u00a0 ", " Asked if Braverman was pushed out, foundation officials pointed to an official resignation\u00a0 ", ", in which Braverman thanked the foundation and the Clintons praised\u00a0his leadership in helping \u201cimprove our governance structure, increase coordination across the Foundation and build better internal processes.\u201d ", " The foundation announced that, while it was looking for a permanent successor, longtime Clinton loyalist Maura Pally would serve as acting CEO. Other than a stint at Bloomberg Philanthropies (which has donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation\u2019s efforts), Pally had spent most of her professional life working for the Clintons, from Bill Clinton\u2019s White House to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and subsequent State Department term.\u00a0 ", " This account of Braverman\u2019s foundation tenure is based on interviews with about a dozen current and former Clinton Foundation staffers, Braverman associates, donors and Clinton allies, most of whom cited the coming presidential race in declining to be identified.\u00a0 ", " At left, Eric Braverman. At right, Bill Clinton with Bruce Lindsey, the former president's old Arkansas lawyer, who sources say complicated reforms pushed by Eric Braverman and Chelsea Clinton. | Left: Moshe Zusman Photography Studio; right: Getty Images ", "\n  ", " ", " Most praised Braverman and said he accomplished much of what he set out to do, leaving the foundation in a strong position headed into 2016. And some dismissed recent scrutiny of the foundation\u2019s fundraising and management as a function of the\u00a0news media\u2019s \u201ctotal obsession\u201d with the Clintons, in the words of Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the conservative media outlet Newsmax, which last year pledged $1 million to the foundation. A longtime participant in the foundation-backed Clinton Global Initiative, Ruddy said, \u201cI don\u2019t see that the ongoing work of the foundation will be undermined in any way by any leadership changes that have taken place.\u201d ", " But some family allies think Braverman\u2019s experience offers lessons that could help Hillary Clinton as she chooses from the scores of operatives jockeying to work for a 2016 campaign. \u201cThis is the story of their lives. They\u2019ve always been torn between the super, super loyalists who are protecting them and the extremely competent people who don\u2019t owe their whole careers to them,\u201d said one former Clinton aide. \u201cThey need to try to strike that balance. And her campaign, at least so far, seems to be bringing in competent people who haven\u2019t all come from that world.\u201d\u00a0 ", " In many ways, what played out over the past two years at the foundation was the story of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s rise. Her power now at the foundation cannot be overstated, according to sources with knowledge of its workings, who say no major decisions occur without her input. Now 35 and with the official title of vice chair at the foundation, Chelsea Clinton is expected to be a key adviser to her mother in the presidential campaign.\u00a0 ", " \u201cI\u2019ve often joked that she would be the ultimate campaign manager,\u201d said a longtime Clinton operative, who said that the foundation was an ideal place for Chelsea Clinton \u201cto come sit at the adult table. And Chelsea is unique in that she was always at the adult table, but now she can participate.\u201d\u00a0 ", " Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian\u00a0said, \"Chelsea has a tremendous positive influence on the foundation, and we\u2019re thrilled to have it.\u00a0Publicly, she\u2019s been an incredibly strong and effective advocate for the foundation and its programs. Internally, she\u2019s done everything she can to improve the way the foundation operates and make sure it\u2019s in the best\u00a0possible position to continue helping people around the world.\u201d ", " But Chelsea Clinton\u2019s rise at times has seemed to threaten some veteran Clinton aides who had carved out influential\u2014and lucrative\u2014positions after long service with her parents. She is blamed in some quarters for marginalizing both Lindsey and Doug Band, who rose from the president\u2019s body man to build and help run the foundation\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative. A third Clinton veteran, Ira Magaziner, saw his portfolio at the foundation diminished during Braverman\u2019s tenure, and sources say Magaziner\u2019s role remains under scrutiny.\u00a0 ", " Magaziner, who was a Rhodes scholar with Bill Clinton in the late 1960s and spearheaded Hillary Clinton\u2019s botched health care reform push in the 1990s, was paid $415,000 in foundation salary and consulting fees in 2013 to help run two programs, the Clinton Climate Initiative and the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Magaziner left the climate project late last year after Braverman brought in new leadership, but he remains CEO of the health initiative. The health group\u2019s board\u2014which includes Magaziner\u2014at the end of last year voted unanimously to initiate an internal governance review by the New York law firm Simpson Thacher, according to foundation officials.\u00a0 ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    Updated ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                                ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

But state spending on conservation programs rose during the Bush years, in contrast to the budget cuts and job cuts that state environmental agencies have sustained under the current governor, Rick Scott. \n ", " ", " More recently, Bush has offered conflicting signals about where he stands on climate change, calling himself a \u201cskeptic\u201d on manmade global warming in a 2009 Esquire interview but warning conservative activists last year that the GOP is imperiling its future by being seen as \u201canti-science.\u201d \n ", " ", " \u201cJeb Bush was the best governor for the environment that Florida every had,\u201d said J.

John Kitzhaber announced Friday that he will step down as Oregon\u2019s governor after a months-long saga centering around allegations of wrongdoing by the Democrat and his first lady. ", " In a statement announcing his resignation, which is effective Feb. 18, Kitzhaber apologized for letting his supporters down but remained largely defiant \u2014 declaring his innocence and decrying the media and his political allies for trying him in the public eye and abandoning him without hearing his defense. ", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cI must also say that it is deeply troubling to me to realize that we have come to a place in the history of this great state of ours where a person can be charged, tried, convicted and sentenced by the media with no due process and no independent verification of the allegations involved,\u201d Kitzhaber said in the statement. \u201cBut even more troubling \u2014 and on a very personal level as someone who has given 35 years of public service to Oregon \u2014 is that so many of my former allies in common cause have been willing to simply accept this judgment at its face value.\u201d ", " His letter of resignation contains 11 bullet points citing the achievements he said he made in more than 12 years as governor. ", " \u201cI ran for a fourth term as your governor to continue that progress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the questions that have been raised about my administration \u2014 specifically allegations against me concerning the work done by my [fianc\u00e9e] Cylvia Hayes and the contracts she obtained during my last term \u2014 and the escalating media frenzy that has stemmed from this \u2014 has clearly reached the point of no return.\u201d ", " The announcement is a stunning fall for the 67-year-old Kitzhaber, an institution in Oregon politics who had just begun his fourth term. The ethics scandal focused on Hayes\u2019 private consulting and business work and the policies of the governor\u2019s administration, where Hayes had also served an unpaid adviser. The saga was often bizarre and personal, with Kitzhaber regularly fending off suggestions that he was \u201cblinded by love\u201d for Hayes in his dealings as governor. ", " Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed state records and electronic communications relating to Kitzhaber, Hayes and 15 others in the administration, the Associated Press reported late Friday. ", " The governor remains under criminal investigation from state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum. \u201cThe governor\u2019s decision to resign will not affect our ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of his and Ms. Hayes\u2019 conduct,\u201d she said in a statement Friday, while still thanking the governor for his service. ", " Secretary of State Kate Brown, a Democrat, will take over for Kitzhaber. On Thursday, Brown said that the governor told her to return early to the state from a conference in Washington, D.C., this week \u2014 only to ask her later why she had come back. ", " In a statement released through her spokesman, Brown called the situation \u201cbizarre and unprecedented\u201d and said she and her staff were \u201cready\u201d in the case of Kitzhaber\u2019s resignation. ", " Oregon does not have a lieutenant governor. Brown will serve as governor until a special election is held in November 2016 for the final two years of Kitzhaber\u2019s term. ", " The Republican Governors Association later Friday immediately attacked Brown for failing to publicly denounce Kitzhaber after months of reports on the scandal. \u201cKate Brown and other Oregon Democrats stayed silent for months on the matter, demonstrating they cared most about their allegiance to their party, not the constituents who elected them,\u201d RGA communications director Jon Thompson said in a statement. ", " For its part, the Democratic Governors Association said Kitzhaber \u201cmade the right decision\u201d and said Brown would \u201ccontinue moving the state forward.\u201d ", " Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden vowed that the state would \u201crefocus\u201d on its goals under Brown\u2019s leadership. ", " The walls had been closing in around Kitzhaber for the past few weeks. Two Oregon papers \u2014 including the state\u2019s largest, The Oregonian, which reluctantly endorsed him in November \u2014 had called on him to step down. He had faced a state ethics commission inquiry into his activities before Rosenblum launched her criminal probe. Charlie Pearce and Jacob Daniels \u2014 top campaign officials for Dennis Richardson, the Republican who lost to Kitzhaber in November \u2014 had vowed to file a recall petition and had already filed paperwork for a political action committee, Oregonians for Public Integrity, for the recall effort. ", " Pearce said Kitzhaber\u2019s resignation would hopefully allow the state move on. \u201cThis is a good day for Oregon and Democracy. No one is above the law \u2014 not even a governor who is supposed to enforce it,\u201d he told POLITICO in an email. \u201cHopefully, this state can get back on to the important work of providing honest services to its citizens once again.\u201d ", " Kitzhaber received little to no support from major Democratic allies: The Democratic Governors Association and state Democratic Party both declined to offer public support. The Oregonian ", " that state Senate President Peter Courtney and House Majority Leader Tina Kotek, both Democrats, met with Kitzhaber Thursday morning to tell him to resign. State Treasurer Ted Wheeler, another top Democratic official, subsequently released a statement calling on him to step down. ", " Still, the governor had been defiant, downplaying the reports during his reelection campaign and telling reporters late last month that, while Hayes would have no role in his administration, he had no plans to step down ", " Hayes had been the subject of several damning reports for months that alleged she earned about $200,000 on contracts closely tied to her work in Kitzhaber\u2019s cabinet, mostly on clean energy policy, which the governor\u2019s administration had made a priority. ", " She conceded last month that she earned $118,000 over two years from the Clean Economy Development Center while she was advising the governor on energy policy. In October, the alt-weekly Willamette Week reported that Hayes received $85,000 or more in consulting contracts for work related to her duties in the administration. And last week, released emails showed that Hayes lobbied for Oregon to implement an initiative from a policy group that had already given her a $25,000 contract. ", " Other reports have indicated that Hayes had not filed all of her earnings from the contracts with the Internal Revenue Service. ", " The first lady had already been under scrutiny after embarrassing reports in October that she both accepted money to enter into an illegal marriage and participated in a plan to illegally grow marijuana on a property in Washington state in the 1990s. ", " A Williamette Week ", " Thursday cited email requests from Kitzhaber\u2019s executive assistant, Jan Murdock, that state officials delete emails from Kitzhaber\u2019s personal account from the state server. The request came as the governor was already under an open inquiry from a state ethics commission. Officials refused to comply with the request, according to the report. ", " Before becoming governor, Kitzhaber served as president of the state Senate for eight years from 1985-1993. He then won two terms as governor from 1995-2003, stepping down because of consecutive term limits in the state. He later won a close election for governor in 2010 and was likely on his way to an easy reelection in 2014 before several reports about Hayes broke and became a major issue in his race against Richardson. He still prevailed narrowly, becoming the first governor in the state\u2019s history elected four times. ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

High on Lew\u2019s agenda was the attempt (largely unsuccessful) to dent a project dear to Beijing: the creation of an alternate international lending institution called the ", ". The bank has been championed by China as an alternative to the World Bank and other international development institutions, in no small part because the United States has resisted allowing China to have larger say in how the established institutions are run. ", "Story Continued Below", " It may not be surprising that the United States has viewed China\u2019s moves with suspicion. While official China\u2019s rhetoric has been all about the needs for more financing of vital Asian projects than current institutions allow, the move to set up a new bank with at least $50 billion in capital led by China is not purely about projects; it\u2019s also about prestige. ", " Washington has responded by trying to convince its allies not to join the bank, whose founding members had to declare by March 31. Americans have been cautioning against the new bank on the grounds that it will lack the protections embedded in the World Bank charter about corruption, transparency and environmental costs. Those may be fair issues, but they have not deterred more than 40 countries from joining the efforts, including notable U.S. allies such as Great Britain, Germany, South Korea and Australia. ", " What a difference from nearly two decades ago, when the United States\u2014then standing at a much higher stature in the world economy\u2014successfully squelched an effort to build such a regional bank during the Asian currency crisis. What a difference as well from the degree to which the United States was the guardian of the global economic system and viewed as both lender and consumer of last resort until the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Before then, the United States not only acted to stave off of meltdowns hither and yon (albeit not always giving the best advice) but was seen by many, China above all, as a model for how an economy should be managed. The financial crisis, because it began on Wall Street, severely dented international confidence in the United States. So did the dithering over the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011, which the rest of the world took as a sign that some American politicians would be willing to commit ritual economic suicide on points of principle regardless of how they imperiled the economic health of the world. ", " It isn\u2019t only the formation of a China-led bank that exposes an America adrift. The inability of the United States to halt the launch of the bank is oddly juxtaposed to its inability to move forward on one of the most important negotiations in the world today: the formation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Unlike the bank, this trade deal has the enthusiastic support of the Obama administration. It is vast multilateral plan to open up the entire Pacific Ocean to free trade, stemming from Chile to Japan. It would in its way be the equivalent to the North American Free Trade agreement but on a much wider scale, and it has been in the works for some time. ", " Now, as the negotiations enter their latest phase, the plan has not surprisingly come under attack from both the left and the right in the United States. The Elizabeth Warren camp of the Democratic Party has warned that a new, vast free-trade agreement will further erode American jobs and wages, and have been actively seeking to halt it. In the House of Representatives, members of the Tea Party caucus and others so distrust the Obama administration that they oppose any extension of negotiating powers (known as \u201cfast track authority\u201d) that are almost certainly needed to get the deal done. ", " So here is where we stand: the Obama administration signals ambivalence about China\u2019s efforts to take a more active role in international trade and development; many in Congress are trying to halt more free trade. The result is a worst of both possible worlds. The United States is effectively saying the rest of the globe, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to spend much more effort facilitating more commerce and greater flow of goods and services, but we don\u2019t want anyone else to either.\u201d That is the equivalent of saying that we don\u2019t want to dance, and neither can you. ", " Many countries question free trade and wonder whether it harms domestic wages. It is true that the rise of free trade in the modern era has coincided with stagnant wages in the developed world. The formation of the World Trade Organization and NAFTA, as well as the European Union and others, all stem from the same late 1980s and early 1990s period when middle class incomes stopped growing in the United States. Multinational corporations, meanwhile, have seen no dearth of profit over the same period. ", " Yet the arguments against trade almost always leave out the cost side of the equation, and the degree to which most goods ranging from food to household necessities have plunged in price over the same period, care of both globalized supply chains and new technologies. The U.S. economy, in particular, has in aggregate thrived, even as the distribution of those rewards has been deeply uneven. ", "By JEFF SMITH and BRIAN MURPHY", "By ROB GOODMAN", "By ", " You can believe that the U.S. economic system is failing at fairness and still recognize that free trade generates massive benefits for both Americans and the world. That said, let\u2019s say you truly, madly, deeply believe that any further extension such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership will harm America and that the best course is to halt and perhaps reverse course behind a Fortress America that satisfies its own economic needs with less recourse to the world at large. If so, then trying to halt China\u2019s attempt to fill a leadership vacuum is both hypocritical and delusional. ", " It has to be one or the other. Either we actively engage a world that is more than ever committed to the freer flow of goods as a means to increase prosperity and enhance the lives of billions of emerging members of the middle class, or we do not and then allow others to lead the way. Choosing to focus on our domestic issues and withdraw is a coherent choice, even though it is likely to fail. But doing that and then attempting to thwart the rise of China as economic leader is not coherent and will do even more harm.

A unified approach in this arena won\u2019t magically restore America\u2019s middle class or solve manifold domestic issues; it would at least turn what is now a muddle into a viable path.

But when I talk about overarching strategy, what I\u2019m talking about is a large plan that involves intelligence, it involves the military, it ought to involve Islamic leaders, there ought to be a communications operation \u2014 there are lots of components of this that need to happen and be coordinated with our allies if we\u2019re going to tackle this problem.\u201d ", " Boehner\u2019s allies think he\u2019s underappreciated when it comes to his savvy on foreign policy and his support of many of Obama\u2019s initiatives on the global stage. People close to him say that despite the criticism from Democrats that he\u2019s undermining the president, he still adheres to the belief that there is one commander in chief and he should be the one to set the nation\u2019s foreign policy. ", " Indeed, they say, he stood up for the White House\u2019s use of certain controversial surveillance techniques when they came under fire. He worked behind the scenes to ensure congressional approval of Obama\u2019s plan to train and arm Syrian rebels. He supported some of Obama\u2019s policies in Afghanistan and sent a memo to his colleagues laying out \u2014 with caveats \u2014 why he thought it was a good idea. He has, however, rejected Obama\u2019s timeline for withdrawal. And he said Wednesday that he was pleased to hear that the Obama administration would lift the arms ban in Egypt \u2014 he said he has been \u201cpushing\u201d the administration to reconsider that policy. ", " But Boehner said he believes that Congress has a robust role in foreign policy that needs to be respected. When he is briefed, he wants to hear from Obama himself \u2014 not an aide. He has pressed the administration to provide detailed briefings \u2014 not just perfunctory phone calls \u2014 prior to a change in policy. He said in the interview that the White House\u2019s outreach has been \u201cadequate,\u201d without elaborating, adding that he hasn\u2019t heard much about the Iran talks. ", " and ", " While Boehner\u2019s prime interest in Congress has been in cutting the budget and reducing taxes, he has long harbored a willingness to take action on foreign policy. On Obama\u2019s inauguration day in 2009, White House adviser Greg Craig told a group of congressional leaders that the president planned to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay without the consent of Congress. With Democrats in control of the House, Boehner used the appropriations process to ensure that never happened. (Craig did not reply to an email seeking comment.) ", " In 2011, he gave what turned out to be a prescient speech about emerging problems in Russia. He had his staffers watch the movie \u201cMiracle\u201d at a staff retreat to remind them of the country\u2019s spirit when the U.S. men\u2019s hockey toppled the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. ", " Now, over the next few months, Boehner will have an opportunity to continue to have an outsized impact on foreign policy. The Obama administration is seeking a resolution explicitly authorizing military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In meetings and conversations, Boehner personally pushed Obama to send a proposal to Capitol Hill, but he is now skeptical it will come together. ", " \u201cIf I see a strategy that I think can work, then you can write an [Authorization for Use of Military Force] that supports it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the president asks for less authority than he has today, you begin to scratch your head. And, secondly, I think they\u2019re looking at this entire problem with blinders on. They need to take a broader view of a bigger strategy to deal with these growing problems.\u201d ", " With parts of Iraq falling to ISIL, Boehner said he told Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that allowing Iranian soldiers to help patrol Tikrit was an \u201cembarrassment to our country.\u201d He said the U.S. should consider repurposing troops to help the Iraqi army fight more efficiently. ", " \u201cWe have nearly 4,000 troops there today,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cAnd they are mostly advising and training. But I think, frankly, if we had some of those people out in the field helping to direct, it would help the Iraqi forces in a big way. So those are boots on the ground, but we\u2019re not talking about sending 100,000 people in there.\u201d ", " While most people are fixated on a rift between America and Israel, Boehner used his time here to downplay it. He strode to a podium with Netanyahu here, and, in brief remarks, Boehner said \u201cwhile we may have political disagreements from time to time,\u201d the two nations share a strong bond. ", " During his visit, Boehner traveled with the Israeli Defense Forces to see the \u201cterror tunnels\u201d near Gaza. He ate lunch with Netanyahu and met with the U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro and the staff at the American consulate in Jerusalem. He also spent time with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon in the brand new Waldorf Astoria, located around the corner from the U.S. Consulate. ", " Boehner dismissed tensions between Obama and Netanyahu as a \u201clittle political spat.\u201d The speaker said he doesn\u2019t expect Netanyahu\u2019s relationship with Obama \u201cto get any worse.\u201d Instead, \u201cI do expect it will get better,\u201d the Ohio Republican said. ", " No one should look at big problems between Israel and America. There are big problems between Bibi and our president. ", " \u201cNo one should look at big problems between Israel and America. There are big problems between Bibi and our president,\u201d Boehner said. He did say Obama\u2019s administration was trying to \u201cimpose a peace process on the prime minister of Israel when he has no partner to sit down and talk to.\u201d ", " \u201cAt the end of the day, we need them and they need us,\u201d Boehner said of Israel. \u201cAnd OK, so you got two people who may not be in love with each other, but the fact is we\u2019re great allies and there\u2019s a lot going on in the world and we need each other.\u201d ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

If we solve the technical issues but not the issue of sanctions, then there\u2019s no use in it.\u201d ", " But the U.S. and its partners have been hesitant to lift sanctions \u2014 of which there are various kinds \u2014 without clear signs of change in Iran\u2019s behavior. \u201cThe president does believe that it would be unwise to, on the first day of an agreement with the Iranians, to take away all of the sanctions that have been in place for such a long time,\u201d Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters Friday.

If there is a deal over the next week, as the two sides approach their end-of-March deadline, it will severely undermine the ideology that has been in place since the beginning of the Iranian Islamic Republic in 1979, and which regime hardliners have used to great effect to consolidate their power: anti-Americanism as a legitimizing force. ", " For more than 35 years, any liaison whatsoever with the United States has been perceived in Iran as simple treason. Any taint of involvement with the United States by anyone has politically undermined the alleged perpetrator and shored up the regime. Every misfortune and disaster the country confronted was blamed on U.S. intrigues against the Islamic Revolution: Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Iran in 1980 and subsequent eight-year war with Iraq; the massacre of more than four hundred Iranian pilgrims in Mecca in 1986; the fall of the oil prices in the late 1980s; the assassinations of hundreds of Iranian revolutionary officials by the People\u2019s Mujahidin and everything else that went wrong in post-revolutionary Iran. The Islamic Revolution was turned into a historic struggle against the U.S. aggressor. ", "Story Continued Below", " Now, for the first time since the founding of the Islamic Republic, Tehran and Washington are openly negotiating, and they may be close to an agreement. Were that to be achieved, the Iranian government would have to own up to a new reality that would be a hammer-blow to hardline thinking and could pave the way for the two countries to cooperate on mutual concerns in the region, including in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and even Lebanon. ", " If the talks fail, on the other hand, it could all easily backfire and play into the hands of the hardliners once again. And we will all be back where we were. ", " The last time officials from the two countries met publicly, which was in Algeria during the anniversary of the Algerian Revolution in 1979, a political earthquake shook Iran and resulted in what became known in the United States as the hostage crisis. Thousands of Iranians rallied against the meeting and demanded the resignation of the government of Mehdi Bazargan, which had dared to negotiate with their American counterparts. Radical Islamic students took over the U.S. Embassy compound in Tehran and detained all its employees. The incident lasted for 444 days. The Iranian government was forced to resign and a powerful anti-Americanism euphoria ran through Iran which has lasted since today. Anti-Americanism became the principal criteria of the emerging revolutionary Iran. The Iranian supreme leader, the late Imam Khomeini, increasingly became more and more hostile towards the United States. ", " A race started among the Iranian leaders in order to prove they were more anti-American than each other. Many moderate Iranian figures fell from grace for not being sufficiently opposed to the United States. Others had to prove their revolutionary credentials by veering strongly toward anti-Americanism. ", "By JAMES F. DOBBINS", "By MICHAEL O'HANLON", "By LARRY J. SABATO", " The nuclear dispute has been portrayed in the same way. When for the first time in 2003 it was known that Iran was carrying out a nuclear program, the reformist government led by moderate P Mohammad Khatami tried to reach an agreement with the West. Tehran voluntarily suspended her enrichment program for two years in order to appease the Western powers. When the West failed to reciprocate, the radicals exploited it to their benefit. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the hardliners won the presidential election in 2005 and the new president went as far as accusing the previous government of \u201ctreason\u201d for slowing down the country\u2019s nuclear program for two crucial years. Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for hatching a new plot against revolutionary Iran. He accused the Americans of preventing Iran from developing her nuclear program. He argued that the country\u2019s nuclear program would lead major technical, industrial, economical and scientific progress and turn Islamic Iran into a regional superpower. That is why, Ahmadinejad explained, the country\u2019s arch enemy, the United States, was so much against it. U.S. disagreement with Iran\u2019s nuclear program was interpreted as stemming from Washington\u2019s long hostility toward Islamic Iran since the 1979 revolution. Ahmadinejad was thus raised to heroic stature. Needless to say, anyone who thought otherwise was considered a traitor. ", " It is against this background that the West should view Iran\u2019s willingness to negotiate now over the nuclear dispute. Any concession in the country\u2019s nuclear activities has been seen, until today, as tantamount to giving in to Western arrogance. Hardliners in Iran would invariably see any suggestion of an easing of hostility between the two countries as a treasonable course, and a path which deviated from Khomeini\u2019s path. ", " So this is another revolution for Iran\u2014and if the talks succeed in a deal it could be an enduring revolution. It will undercut the hardliners who have been using anti Americanism as a powerful fuel to justify a wide range of policies both domestically and internationally and exploit Anti-Americanism to justify their mismanagement and wrongdoings. At the same time it will create a more appropriate climate for moderates and reformists inside the country who won\u2019t fear engaging in serious conversations with hardliners on both domestic and international concerns, as they will no longer have to labor under the fear of being accused of being pro-American.

Both parties saw cause to support it, but for completely different reasons.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) intended to be a less disruptive alternative to Kirk\u2019s bill, which the president says would derail negotiations.

It\u2019s Boxer-Schatz. It\u2019s the exact same thing that we wrote. What we say is the president should certify if Iran ever breaks out, and if they break out we have immediate votes and that\u2019s my bill,\u201d Boxer said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d ", " and ", " Republicans said Boxer was wrong. One aide shot back: \u201cDems who vote for this will now be on record as backing the purpose of Kirk-Menendez Iran sanctions.\u201d The reason, the aide said, is that Boxer\u2019s bill calls for a vote if the president cannot certify that Iran is keeping its end of the agreement, while Kirk\u2019s legislation imposes sanctions without such a vote. ", " The controversial vote was days in the making. Kirk had wanted a Wednesday vote, but Democrats rejected that attempt. Then he and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) got together to alter his language that called for sanctions if there are \u201cviolations\u201d of any nuclear agreement. Their discussions produced a handwritten addition to the amendment reinstating sanctions \u201cif the president cannot make a determination and certify that Iran is complying with\u201d the terms of any deal.

Except Brown doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s what the amendment will do. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s what the president\u2019s going to do anyway and we want to speak as Congress that he follows through on the sanctions and the certification,\u201d Brown said in an interview. \u201cThis amendment is minor and in my view the language that we negotiate with Kirk will underscore how important it is that negotiations go forward.\u201d ", " Senators even tried to voice vote the amendment to speed its approval, but Kirk insisted on a roll call to get everyone on the record. When he asked for a roll call, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) audibly groaned as the Senate churned through another 20-minute vote. ", " Ultimately, the nonbinding budget amendment doesn\u2019t carry the weight of law anyway, and would have no formal effect on sanctions or the ongoing nuclear negotiations. Supporters of the Kirk measure had hoped it would send a clear message on where the Senate stands. But, instead, it seems to have only muddied the waters further when it comes to figuring out exactly what the Senate would be willing to support on Iran sanctions. ", " The Iran amendment was just one of dozens to be considered during the budget\u2019s \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d a dramatic exercise in congressional impulse given that senators have perhaps 10 minutes to study an amendment with their staff before casting a vote on it. ", " Most of the issues are domestic, but even a nonbinding vote on Iran carries some international weight: The Senate hasn\u2019t voted on Iran issues since Obama began negotiations, along with five other world powers, aimed at scaling back the country\u2019s nuclear program. The White House is worried that any signal from Capitol Hill could upset ongoing negotiations with Iran, and officials have pushed back strongly against Democratic supporters of the Kirk-Menendez amendment, with Senate Democrats eventually vowing not to support it on the floor until after March 24. ", " On Thursday, Senate Democrats were finally on the spot. All 46 of them voted for Kirk\u2019s amendment, which no matter how the amendment is interpreted, show there may eventually be a veto-proof majority in Congress in April when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) brings Iran legislation to the floor.
