", "Story Continued Below", " Polling in the single digits and lagging top-tier competitors in fundraising, Booker this week sought to reboot his campaign, launching a \u201cJustice For All\u201d two-week, national tour heavy on economic policy proposals and social justice messaging.

Booker, who often references Martin Luther King Jr., is shaping his candidacy as one that seeks to bring back civic grace and discourse, saying that political tribalism in America runs so deep \u201cwe can\u2019t even do the things that we agree on.\u201d", "The race for 2020 starts now.

", " It\u2019s a tricky platform to execute, said Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. While he said Booker\u2019s messaging is \u201ccompelling,\u201d it comes at a political moment when the party is hungry for candidates to offer up evidence that they can defeat President Donald Trump.

This is a moral moment in our country where it\u2019s got to be about uniting Americans.\u201d ", " A March ", " in Iowa backs up Booker\u2019s premise: 50 percent of those surveyed said it was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d that a 2020 candidate is \u201csomeone who can heal the racial, ethnic and partisan divide in our country.\u201d", " Still, as he moves into the second quarter of the most crowded and diverse Democratic presidential primary in history, Booker is finding that the skills he's long tapped as an orator with a mayor\u2019s flair for finding human connection so far hasn\u2019t been enough to break through. On top of a slew of other U.S. senators in the race, fresh faces like former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are deploying similar retail traits to dazzle prospective voters. ", "So far, according to polls, O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg have ranked above Booker, who also trails top-tier candidates in the race including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.", "Likewise, Booker\u2019s first-quarter $5 million fundraising haul ranked below most other top-tier Democratic candidates.

", " With that in mind, Booker has shifted toward a more policy-heavy agenda in his two-week tour across the country that will take him to early presidential states and the South.", " In an Iowa event on tax day, Booker unrolled an expansive income tax credit, proposing to raise the Earned Income Tax Credit by 25 percent, aiming to significantly reach more people. ", " \u201cWe should be having the biggest increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit and that\u2019s what I\u2019m proposing, by making sure that anybody who works gets back from the government \u2013 if you\u2019re earning more than $50,000 a year, or if you\u2019re a couple, $90,000 a year -- you will get a tax credit in this country,\u201d he said. Then he gently jabbed at the crowd for failing to react. \u201cAnd by the way, before you even applaud, let me tell you,\u201d he said to laughter. ", " Even as Booker sought a recharge in Iowa, he was overshadowed by Buttigieg, whose unexpected surge drew among the biggest crowds for Democratic 2020 candidates touring the first-in-the-nation primary state. ", " \u201cI think part of it is the newness factor. We have a lot of great candidates in the field who are pretty well known. Pete\u2019s bubbled up because he\u2019s new and different. But also his demeanor, he\u2019s very chill, has a great sense of humor but he\u2019s very knowledgeable,\u201d said Vanessa Phelan, chair of Northwest Des Moines Democrats. ", " Phelan noted that while Buttigieg\u2019s crowd was unexpectedly large, she\u2019s seen many of the same people attending events for 2020 candidates as they\u2019re still shopping around. Asked if Democrats wanted to hear Booker\u2019s message of love and unity, she said they do \u2013 but that they want more. ", " \u201cWhat we all just really want is for the presidency to change hands,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a space for that message but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s resonating.\u201d", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

According to Smithsonian, it\u2019s the largest annual White House event.", "While the modern tradition is closely associated with the presidency, Easter egg rolling in Washington started on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, beneath the shiny white shell of the Capitol dome. But the activity was once so scandalous and spun so far out of control that an angry Congress outlawed it on its turf.

The building\u2019s marble terrace did not yet exist, and Congress had just recently employed the consulting services of a young landscape architect by the name of Frederick Law Olmsted to beautify the area. It was a high-profile project, and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, Justin Morrill, admonished him \u201cnot to have it botched.\u201d", "It was on to this scene that hundreds and later thousands of children would annually descend in a demolition derby of egg-throwing chaos.

Newspapers would write of the hordes of unsupervised children that spontaneously converged on Capitol Hill, \u201cracing, and tumbling and rolling, regardless alike of limbs and dress, or what nurses or mas\u2019 said or thought. The sport was exhilarating, although the re-ascent and incidents of tumble and roll became so exciting that the shouts of laughter and the merry cries of comrade to comrade made a glad chorus which swelled along the line.\u201d", "The celebration of 1876 drew an unusually boisterous crowd, with a reporter for the ", " describing the Capitol grounds as \u201cthronged with lads and lassies, aye, and many older heads congregated to witness the pranks and capers of the boys and girls in rolling the eggs from the crest of the hill to the lawn below.\u201d Poorly timed morning rainfall that year \u201chad the effect of dampening the grass somewhat,\u201d but could not deter the stampede of tiny feet sprinting across the soggy lawns.", "The next day, lawmakers arrived at the Capitol to a scene resembling an abandoned carnival ground.

The aides who led it \u2014 deputy chief of staff Anne Bradley and Castaldo \u2014 did not contact two former employees whom the woman said could corroborate and add to her allegations of inappropriate workplace conduct. Gillibrand\u2019s office interviewed only current employees. ", "\u201cAnyone doing a thorough investigation would contact any witness that had or was likely to have relevant information, particularly when there is a hostile working environment alleged,\u201d said Les Alderman, an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment in the workplace and represented an alleged victim in a case against former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) that garnered national attention last year. \u201cThe idea that an employer is somehow restricted from contacting former employees who could shed light on the situation is laughable.\u201d", "POLITICO reached out to more than 20 former Gillibrand staffers to see if there was a pattern of behavior by Malik, including the two aides the woman specifically asked the office to contact.", "One of those two former staffers said Malik often called her fat and unattractive to her face and made light of sexual abuse. She recalled one instance in which Malik remarked that a particular woman they were talking about \u201ccouldn\u2019t get laid", "unless she was raped.\u201d The person did not report that behavior at the time but now says she wishes she had. ", "Two more staffers who worked for Gillibrand said the woman\u2019s claims of Malik\u2019s inappropriate workplace behavior matched their own experiences. They said Malik regularly made misogynistic jokes, frequently appraised what they wore, disparaged the looks of other female staffers and rated the attractiveness of women who came in for interviews. ", "The office also dispensed with the allegations of Malik\u2018s retaliation without informing the woman of its conclusions or any disciplinary action.", "Gillibrand\u2019s office acknowledged it found evidence that Malik had made unspecified inappropriate comments and revoked his expected promotion, which would have come with a raise. It also moved his desk and gave him a final warning. This was not the first time the senator\u2019s top aides dealt with an allegation of bad behavior by Malik: According to a firsthand witness of an incident in 2015, Malik confronted a fellow aide in the office. He got in the man\u2019s face, pushed his desk and threatened to \u201cfucking\u201d hurt him, the witness said, describing the confrontation as \u201cviolent.\u201d ", "But Fassler and Bradley told the woman that her claim of inappropriate advances was a case of \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d and too much of a \u201che said, she said\u201d to warrant Malik\u2018s dismissal, according to contemporaneous notes taken by the woman. ", "The office did not deny those terms were used but disputed that characterization of the investigation. \u201cThis case was never viewed as \u2018he said, she said.\u2019 Upon conclusion of the full and thorough investigation, it was determined that the evidence revealed employee misconduct that, while inappropriate, did not constitute sexual harassment,\u201d the office said. ", "\u201cWhen I had the courage to speak up about my harasser, I was belittled by her office and treated like an inconvenience,\u201d the woman said of Gillibrand in an interview. \u201cShe kept a harasser on her staff until it proved politically untenable for her to do so.\u201d", "As part of her freelance work for an events production firm, she staffed the kickoff rally for one of Gillibrand\u2019s rivals in the Democratic presidential primary. She has not done any other work for that or other presidential campaigns, and is not interviewing with any 2020 contenders. ", "Malik became Gillibrand\u2019s driver in 2011 after serving two tours in the Iraq War. He became such a constant presence in Gillibrand\u2019s life \u2014 he had a set of keys to her home and often drove her children to school with her \u2014 that some staffers dubbed him \u201cthe keeper of her purse.\u201d The office changed his title to \u201cmilitary adviser\u201d in 2015 despite his responsibilities remaining largely the same.", "Though she said she was put off by Malik\u2019s comments about other female aides, the woman said her dealings with him had been generally cordial. But that changed when Gillibrand told him on July 10, 2018, that she wanted him to direct advance work for her future trips. All the details of the new job hadn\u2019t been settled, but Abbas told the woman that he would be \u201cin charge\u201d of her position, she said.", "\u201cI have treated [A]bbas the same the entire year I have worked here,\u201d the woman wrote in a detailed timeline of events that she later sent to Bradley, the deputy chief of staff. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after this \u2018promotion\u2019 that he decided to hit on me.\u201d", "According to that timeline and documentation sent to Gillibrand\u2019s office at the time, the alleged harassment started almost immediately after word of the planned promotion, with increasingly aggressive advances. In one late-night text message, Malik told her he now understood the meaning of the clown emoji \u2014 it meant \u201cdown to clown,\u201d an innuendo for having sex from the movie \u201cBlockers,\u201d he elaborated the next morning.", "On one day alone, July 13, she said Malik made four unwanted advances, which were all rebuffed. The first occurred alone in the office early in the morning when Malik told the woman he had a secret for her: Her boss had just quit.", "\u201cUgh I shouldn\u2019t have told you. You are totally going to tell people,\u201d he said, according to her notes. \u201cWhy do I love you! I should hate you!\u201d", "After Malik prodded her for a secret of her own, she said Malik walked up to her desk and asked, \u201cIf we had met in a bar would it have happened for us?\u201d ", "And at a birthday party for another staffer that evening, Malik told her privately that \u201cI thought by debrief you meant you were hitting on me,\u201d referencing an earlier text message. ", "She asked him if he was kidding. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not kidding,\u201d he responded. \u201c[O]h wow ok no I was absolutely not hitting on you,\u201d she replied, according to her timeline. He pressed two more times, prompting the woman to chide him in a text: \u201cYou\u2019re married!!\u201d He still sent a string of flirtatious texts later, including one with a clown emoji. ", "\n                                ", "The woman said she tried to stay away from Malik the following week. But he began complaining", "that she was being mean to him because of his expected promotion, and said that he would give her the silent treatment until she apologized. \u201cThis seriously was so upsetting to me because I was not upset about that. I was upset with him sexually harassing me and he is trying to create his own narrative,\u201d she wrote in her timeline.", "On July 25, the woman emailed Bradley her detailed recollection of events, which she had written over the previous week. In addition to the advances, the woman claimed that Malik \u201csaid derogatory and inappropriate things about women since I started here.\u201d She alleged that Malik called a female colleague \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cugly,\u201d would rate the appearance of potential hires, and told colleagues that the office\u2019s new fellow \u2014 essentially a young female intern \u2014 \u201cwanted him.\u201d", "Bradley immediately looped in Fassler, who called the woman. They both assured her they were taking the accusations seriously. Bradley and Castaldo, the general counsel, immediately went to the Senate\u2019s employment counsel and consulted with it throughout the process, a routine step for Senate offices when confronted with sexual harassment complaints to protect them from liability. ", "Though it\u2019s common in Congress for top aides to investigate alleged harassment by another office employee, experts in sexual harassment law said the arrangement is inherently unfair to the complainant. Ideally, an independent third party should look into such claims given that staff members have pre-existing relationships that often pose a conflict of interest, they said. ", "Gillibrand\u2019s office said it had previously explored hiring outside investigators but determined it was \"not a realistic or viable option.\" However, experts said several House offices have taken that step. ", "\u201cThere have been instances when offices have sought out an objective third party to conduct the investigation and that seems to be a method that increases fairness for all parties concerned,\u201d said Kristin Nicholson, a former longtime chief of staff on the Hill and co-founder of Congress Too, an organization of former congressional staffers committed to combating sexual harassment in Congress.", "Gillibrand herself has made the case for a similar setup for the military, pushing legislation that would have independent prosecutors \u2014 rather than commanders \u2014 handle allegations of sexual misconduct in the military.", "The main mechanism for the woman to bring a complaint outside the Senate office would have been through the Office of Compliance. She visited that office before going to her superiors but found it unhelpful, saying a staffer merely recited language from its website. She also knew that in order to file a complaint she would first have to go through at least 30 days of mediation and likely more. Last year, Gillibrand called that a \u201cdaunting requirement,\u201d while pushing to reform the compliance office.", "So the woman turned to Gillibrand\u2019s aides. In addition to the senator\u2019s public stance on the issue, the office had required staffers to undergo three training sessions the previous year on sexual harassment prevention, including one in early July. ", "When she learned on July 30 that the office had disciplined but not fired Malik, the woman was upset. But at the time, she trusted that the office did all it could. \u201cI felt satisfied there had been a fair process,\u201d she recounted in her resignation letter. ", "That appraisal, however, began to change the next morning when Bradley entered the woman\u2019s office and told her that Malik was upset. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d Bradley said, according to notes of the conversation the woman emailed to herself immediately afterward. ", "The woman said Malik should be feeling remorseful. But Bradley said Malik felt that losing his potential promotion was too harsh a punishment. She also said Fassler, the chief of staff, had said Malik was \u201clucky\u201d because the office could have fired him for many reasons. ", "A few hours later, the woman met with Bradley in Gillibrand\u2019s office and asked Bradley why Malik hadn\u2019t been dismissed if there were other grounds for firing him. Fassler then called and was put on speakerphone. He said Bradley\u2019s remarks to her were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and tried to explain his comment by saying he had reasons to fire everyone in the office, including her. That further upset her.", "The woman then pressed Bradley on why the office did not reach out to the former employees she had said could speak to Malik\u2019s behavior. Bradley told her that lawyers recommended not contacting former employees, according to contemporaneous notes of the conversation that Gillibrand\u2019s office said were \u201cnot accurate.\u201d ", "Robbie Kaplan, a co-founder of the TIME\u2019S UP Legal Defense Fund, spoke with POLITICO last week at the request of Gillibrand\u2019s office. While Kaplan declined to speak on the record about this particular case, she said the decision whether to interview former employees varies from case to case depending on the facts and circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s always possible to look back and criticize with the benefit of hindsight,\u201d Kaplan said.", "Knowing she was upset, Fassler called the woman back, apologized, and tried to affirm that she was satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, according to another email the woman wrote to herself that documented the conversation.", "\n                    ", "\n                    By ", " and ", "The woman said she had felt fine until her conversation with Bradley. Fassler said she must have just misinterpreted Bradley, to which she retorted: \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of people saying I\u2019m misinterpreting things.\u201d", "Later that evening, the woman noticed that Malik did not update her when Gillibrand decided not to go to a softball game and then the next morning did not tell her that the senator was running behind schedule. She went to her bosses and said Malik was making her job more difficult in response to her reporting him. Though Gillibrand\u2019s office contends such updates weren\u2019t required, Malik had regularly given the woman and others in the office notice in the past. ", "Bradley consulted the Senate employment counsel again and Gillibrand\u2019s office determined \u201cthat no retaliation had occurred and that no disciplinary action was appropriate.\u201d It added that \u201cin one verbal conversation, [Fassler] proactively told her they looked into it and to let him know if anything continued.\u201d ", "Beyond that, Bradley and Fassler did not update the woman on the specific steps taken, the conclusions of the investigation, or any disciplinary action. That made her think the office didn\u2019t take her complaint seriously.", "Bradley exacerbated that feeling when she accidentally sent the woman an email intended for Fassler. \u201cI get the impression she is trying to divide and concur [sic]. After today, neither of us should meet with her alone,\u201d Bradley wrote, mistakenly believing that the woman had gone to Fassler alone with her complaint. ", "Gillibrand\u2019s office argued it made many efforts to make the woman feel supported. Bradley and Fassler regularly checked in with her and assured her they \u201cbelieved\u201d her even if they did not dismiss Malik. Fassler canceled a meeting in which she and Malik would have had to be in the same room, and he talked to her about other opportunities in the office \u2014 positions she considered demotions \u2014 if she no longer wanted to work in her current role, which required her to interact with Malik.", "And after the harassment investigation ended but before she quit, Gillibrand approached the woman and tried to console her with a quick hug and a \u201cWe love you.\u201d The woman considered it an empty gesture. ", "On Aug. 13, the woman told Fassler that she would resign and cited the office\u2019s handling of the investigation. As she thought about the decision earlier that morning, the woman explained to a friend that \u201c[Malik] was using his position and relationship with the senator to solicit me. I acted the same as I always had: friendly, kind, outgoing, inclusive. But this time he decided to read it as me wanting him,\u201d according to a copy of the email. ", "She recalled that Fassler reacted defensively about the office\u2019s handling of the allegations and told her that she had also committed fireable offenses during her time in the office. One comment by Fassler that particularly galled her, she said, was that investigation found that she had \u201cfed\u201d Malik alcohol while he was on duty as a driver. In her claim, she wrote that she and Malik had grabbed a quick drink in the courtyard of the Capitol late one afternoon to talk about the office. She was frustrated that Fassler was blaming her given that Malik is an adult capable of deciding what to consume.", "\u201cI felt as though I was being belittled, insulted and intimidated even when I was trying to quit,\u201d she wrote in her resignation letter.", "Gillibrand\u2019s office acknowledged the exchange but said Fassler was obligated to raise what it called \u201can unrelated office policy violation\u201d with the woman, referring to the alcohol incident. The office said Fassler, throughout the case, \u201crepeatedly demonstrated his respect and gratitude for the employee, and he was grateful she came forward.\u201d", "\n                    ", "\n                    By ", " and ", "Fassler asked her to reconsider resigning and then offered to allow her to stay until she found a new job so she could keep her health benefits.", "She decided to leave. In her final days at the office, the woman agonized over whether to send the letter to Gillibrand. Doing so would almost certainly burn bridges and likely hurt her professional prospects in the clubby world of national politics. ", "It was Gillibrand\u2019s female-focused advocacy that had made the woman want to work for her in the first place. For years, the senator has positioned herself at the forefront of fighting sexual misconduct in the military and in Congress. She wrote in Fortune last April that \u201cCongress has a sexual harassment problem\u2014and isn\u2019t taking it seriously,\u201d and helped push through legislation to overhaul the institution\u2019s practices. ", "\u201cWhether it\u2019s in the military, a college campus, the NFL, corporate America, or the halls of Congress, survivors of harassment too often continue to be disbelieved, blamed, and even retaliated against,\u201d Gillibrand wrote. \"This stops when we value all people \u2014 women and men who are harassed \u2014 and when we listen, believe them, and create a system in which justice is possible.\u201d", "Gillibrand has made her advocacy for women the animating cause of her presidential bid \u2014 which the woman had hoped to work on \u2014 ", " to the Democratic primary as \u201cwomen plus.\u201d", "\u201cOur campaign is confronting the toxic culture of sexism and misogyny in our political system,\u201d a Facebook ad last month read. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for women to be heard.

", "An inevitable limitation of the study, however, was that it looked at only a small range of politicians, which limited the analyses of primary match-ups in particular (to John Edwards vs. Hillary Clinton, and Rudy Giuliani vs. Elizabeth Dole). All of the politicians in the study were also white, it should be noted (at the time the poll was taken, in 2006, future president Barack Obama had no real national following).", "There\u2019s also the fraught question of whether Hillary Clinton was an inherently problematic candidate and therefore not the ideal test case for how gender bias affects voters. As she faced surprising losses in the 2008 presidential primary campaign and the 2016 presidential election, reasonable people may disagree about the extent to which this was due to unique features of her profile, policies and history.

Indeed, Smith and Paul didn\u2019t find significant evidence of gender bias in operation even in primary match-ups (though this result is highly limited, given they compared only the two aforementioned pairings). This finding coheres with the hopeful results we saw in the 2018 election, when an unprecedented number of female members of Congress were elected. But it also leaves open the question of how well women will fare when it comes to the highest profile race of all: the presidential election.", "Why might presidential races be different? One plausible theory is that in seeking the Oval Office women are competing less for a service position and more for a position of perceived power and authority\u2014indeed, virtually the most masculine-coded authority position imaginable.

And men, at least white men, may gain an illicit ", " from running against women. ", "This hypothesis is borne out by a 2004 study by Madeline Heilman et al, ", " The researchers had participants evaluate a hypothetical male versus female employee, who held the same position (Assistant Vice President) at an aircraft company. The participants received exactly the same information about each of the employees, on average, by alternating the names \u201cJames\u201d and \u201cAndrea\u201d on each of their two personnel files. The results? When information about their competence was equivocal, Andrea was found to be less ", " than James by 86 percent of people\u2014but the two were found to be equally likable, on average.

Researchers described this effect as \u201cdramatic.\u201d We may be seeing a similar pattern borne out, in the wild, when it comes to presidential races. ", "There\u2019s an apparently rival hypothesis well worth considering: Voters are wary of female candidates ", " Hillary Clinton lost in two presidential races (first in the primary, then in the general).

Picture someone who responds with pragmatic defeatism to injustice before the race is even well underway. How common is this person, really?", "It is difficult to know. But there is a simpler explanation that both explains the patterns we see and coheres with what we know about human psychology: People who might be explicitly committed to egalitarianism still have gender biases in certain contexts, including presidential races.

But since the event was in Wisconsin, none of them will actually be voting in the early states where Sanders hopes to put a scare into Hillary Clinton. \n ", " ", " Rather than single-mindedly chasing votes across New Hampshire and the 99 counties of Iowa, Sanders has instead embarked on a swing through the progressive heartland, designed to generate big crowds and a national liberal groundswell behind his candidacy. \n ", " ", "Story Continued Below", " He\u2019s running to win a movement as much as an election, and there\u2019s no clearer sign of it than the liberal strongholds he\u2019s visiting \u2014 Madison, Wisconsin; Minneapolis; Denver; Portland, Maine. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe news of large crowds manages to make its way to people, particularly in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d said senior Sanders adviser Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s demonstrating that the message Bernie is delivering is connecting with a large audience.\u201d \n ", " ", " The idea is to barnstorm the nation\u2019s most progressive cities in the hopes of attracting field organizers, small-dollar donors and, most importantly, the kind of media attention that insurgent candidates are typically starved for. \n ", " ", " \u201cCities chosen are likely to produce donors and enthusiastic crowds \u2014 something you all love to see so you can say the Clinton campaign must be/should be starting to worry,\u201d said Gina Glantz, who ran Bill Bradley\u2019s 2000 primary challenge to Democratic front-runner Al Gore. \n ", " ", " More than 3,000 people showed up to see Sanders in Minneapolis on the Sunday after his campaign kickoff \u2014 the only place he visited on that maiden trip other than New Hampshire and Iowa. (The campaign, expecting a much smaller town meeting, apologized at the time for not having enough coffee and bagels for everyone.) At least 5,000 showed up to the University of Denver for a Saturday night rally earlier this month. \n ", " ", " On Wednesday night in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s liberal citadel, roughly 10,000 people showed up for a raucous rally \u2014 by far the largest number for any candidate in either party so far. \n ", " ", " \u201cWhoa, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, there are a lot of people here,\u201d said Sanders, who largely gave his standard stump speech. \n ", " ", " \u201cTonight, we have more people at a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States than any other candidate,\u201d he said, to cheers from the crowd. \n ", " ", " Next week, Sanders will be in Portland, Maine \u2014 though the campaign isn\u2019t entirely sure where, since they have to change to a larger venue after getting more than 2,000 Internet RSVPs. And the campaign is also planning an upcoming rally in Boston, likely in July. \n ", " ", " Sanders hasn\u2019t exactly ignored Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 he\u2019ll be in the Hawkeye State for several days later this week. The candidate has also drawn big crowds in those early states \u2014 his Davenport rally was the biggest for any candidate in Iowa so far. He\u2019s also visited South Carolina and Nevada recently. \n ", " ", " But it\u2019s the bigger liberal cities (and college towns) that offer the prospect of the kind of huge turnout and passionate response that allows Sanders to make the case that his long-shot campaign should be taken seriously. \n ", " ", " Wisconsin, in particular, has proved to be friendly territory. Earlier this month, Sanders scored a burst of national attention by winning 41 percent of the vote at the Wisconsin Democratic Party convention\u2019s straw poll, finishing a close second to the front-runner Clinton \u2014 a strong showing given that Sanders is not a registered Democrat and his campaign didn\u2019t organize at the event. \n ", " ", " On Wednesday, Sanders returned to the 10,000-seat Alliant Energy Center, where he spoke at Fighting Bob Fest, an annual Wisconsin progressive festival, in 2011. He also keynoted last year\u2019s festival. \n ", " ", " The big-crowd strategy is a familiar one for liberal insurgents like Sanders. In 2007, Barack Obama was way down in the polls but got tens of thousands of people at rallies in Austin, Oakland, Atlanta and New York City. Howard Dean, the last Vermonter to run for president, also earned attention for his Sleepless Summer tour in 2003 \u2014 a 10-city trip that drew huge crowds in liberal hubs such as Portland, Oregon; Seattle; New York City; and Chicago. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that worked,\u201d said Dean\u2019s campaign manager Joe Trippi. \u201cWe raised quite a bit of money. The size of the crowds demonstrated that we had a significant following in the party.\u201d \n ", " ", " Trippi noted that the big venues also allow Sanders to establish himself as the clear second-place candidate to Clinton and close out other primary rivals, like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley or former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt obliterates the rest of the field \u2026 It captures press attention,\u201d said Trippi. \u201cRight now at this stage, what you\u2019re trying to do is be one of the two. And so far, Sanders\u2019 strategy is doing a much better job of that than any other candidates.\u201d \n ", " ", " The progressive strongholds also offer Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist and perhaps the most liberal sitting senator, something of a home-field advantage: as a former mayor of the very progressive Burlington, Vermont, he\u2019s familiar with the voice and ethos of those places. That helps explain why, when he was exploring a potential bid in April, Sanders tested his message in Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, where he campaigned for liberal mayoral candidate Chuy Garcia. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt provides an echo chamber for your message,\u201d said Doug Wilson, deputy campaign manager for Gary Hart\u2019s 1984 Democratic presidential campaign against former Vice President Walter Mondale. \u201cIt would be like Ted Cruz going to a lot of places in Texas and the South.\u201d \n ", " ", " There\u2019s another benefit to the big-crowd strategy: It provides a helpful split-screen contrast with Clinton, who has mostly eschewed large rallies in favor of smaller, more intimate roundtables and more private fundraising events. When Sanders was railing against income inequality at a big rally in Las Vegas last month, Clinton held fundraisers with movie stars and Hollywood executives in Southern California. \n ", " ", " The Sanders campaign insists that the tour of liberal America isn\u2019t just an exercise in crowd-building, but is instead crucial for building a national campaign. \n ", " ", " \u201cHe goes to Madison. He has a big crowd. That\u2019s how we build an organization in Wisconsin. For a campaign that hasn\u2019t been around the block before and built an organization [that\u2019s important],\u201d Devine said before the event. \n ", " ", " Still, the campaign \u2014 and the candidate himself \u2014 isn\u2019t shy about touting the strong attendance numbers. \u201cThis campaign is catching fire for a simple reason, and the simple reason is we are telling the truth,\u201d Sanders said at a recent fundraiser in Southern California, after rattling off crowd sizes and RSVPs from events in Las Vegas and Denver. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

You wrote a piece recently in ", ", which was really powerful explaining a little bit about the work that you do, and you talked about how presidents \u2014 when they leave in their farewell addresses \u2014 tend to sum up, and really to summon the values that are at the heart of American foreign policy. President Obama, in fact, said in his goodbye address that \u201cAmerica\u2019s rivals will never match our influence unless we give up what we stand for.\u201d And that seemed to me like already President Obama was anticipating this switch in foreign policy, anticipating a world in which Donald Trump would make his very first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, to a country that doesn\u2019t even allow women to drive.", "That it\u2019s not that you and others in the Obama administration didn\u2019t see pretty clearly what was going to happen, but trying to understand now what are the consequences of that? Has America gotten out of the human rights and values business? ", "Our president has, unfortunately. I don\u2019t think America has. I think that the United States of America has for a very long time had an idea of itself as a country that stands for something larger in the world than just our immediate self-enrichment or self-protection. That idea has inspired us in our moments of crisis from World War II to the Cold War. I think it has inspired people all over the world and sometimes, persuaded them to tolerate a bit more power from the United States than they might tolerate from other great powers [laughs] because we\u2019ve managed to convince them more often than not that America uses that power for the common good, for the betterment of the world.", "When we have not lived up to that ideal; when we have screwed up, as we have many, many times, the one thing that brings us back is the sense that we are supposed to do better. So, we judge ourselves in accordance with this very high standard. And all of our presidents really since Jimmy Carter at least have explicitly made the promotion of human rights and freedoms and democracy part of our foreign policy. We\u2019ve always debated how to do it, and I\u2019ve served under two presidents: President Clinton and President Obama, and we had all kinds of arguments. How do we do it in Saudi Arabia? Should we intervene in countries like Syria or Bosnia or Libya when people are in trouble? How do we deal with countries that are partners on terrorism or security but also abuse their people?", "And we have these arguments about the means, but we\u2019ve always agreed on the ends. Every president has believed that America is better off if people around the world have greater freedoms, and that is the radical shift that we\u2019re experiencing now. ", "Well, it\u2019s interpreting that you make this point; that we\u2019re now at a point where arguably the Trump administration or at least the president himself. Maybe not everybody in it. Obviously, there are some people, like U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who are pursuing their own more traditional version of American foreign policy at the moment, and we can talk about that. So you\u2019re making this argument basically that that\u2019s the disjuncture of President Trump?", "I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people, as I\u2019m sure you have around Washington, though, who think there is more continuity than people would like to acknowledge between President Obama and President Trump when it comes to this issue of imposing sort of an American vision of the world onto other countries. President Obama obviously had a different demeanor, but he, too, shared some attributes with President Trump [such as his] weariness about projecting values at the heart of our foreign policy. He was kind of a Democratic version of a realist. ", " I don\u2019t agree with that. I think there has always been a wariness in American foreign policy to varying degrees of imposing, interfering, getting ourselves embroiled in complicated foreign situations. Sometimes we do it. Sometimes we hold back. But it\u2019s all a debate about the means. President Obama embraced the Arab Spring. He spoke out in favor of dissidents in Egypt and Bahrain and Libya. He intervened militarily in Libya to support the revolution there. His initial speech in the region\u2014at the famous speech in Cairo ...", " The Cairo speech.", "was all about the potential for political transformation and how that\u2019s the key to fighting terrorism and extremism. And then in his farewell address, like that of every president since forever was, as you mentioned, a tribute to this quality of American leadership around the world. Now, some people criticized us in the Obama administration for not doing more in some places. Some people felt we did too much. But President Obama, like President Bush, like President Reagan, like President Clinton, believed that we would be better off if people in Saudi Arabia had the right to choose their leaders, if women had the right to drive. If folks in countries that are beset by extremism had peaceful ways of expressing their grievances. And what\u2019s very, very different\u2014it\u2019s not there\u2019s a different tone or a different way of doing things in this administration; it\u2019s that President Trump has explicitly said that he is just not interested in advancing this aim and by his words and actions.", "And almost more important, his body language: You can just tell that he has a clear preference for, admiration for strong men and dictators. My goodness, he even has explicitly praised the president of the Philippines campaign of murdering drug users and drug dealers in the thousands. This is, I have to say, just obscene and a complete departure from decades of American tradition. ", " It\u2019s hard to imagine who would be a successor to you as an assistant secretary in charge of Human Rights in the Trump administration. We can talk a little bit more later on what\u2019s going on inside the State Department since you\u2019ve left. But I want to keep on this Obama thing. Take us behind the curtain a little bit. You pointed out, obviously, there were many debates. One of the things that was striking was President Obama\u2019s own evolution. He is famous for this stirring rhetoric. He gives this Cairo speech. He\u2019s given many speeches that invoked the grandiose nature of American commitment to the world and its transformational view really of why what happens inside other countries matters to them and to the rest of us. And yet, dot, dot, dot.", "And yet, the Syria Civil War unfolded on his watch. Six years, hundreds of thousands dead. Millions of refugees. This is surely going to be a blot on President Obama\u2019s record. He had the ability to do many things he chose in the end not to do. It was a series of circular and for you, I\u2019m sure, very painful debates. You were supportive at various points in time of doing more. Give us a little bit of a window into what this abstract human rights debate looks like in practice. I mean, your job was to be the guy at the table standing up for those principles and yet, again and again, that collides with a lot of other competing realities for a president forced to make those decisions.", "It\u2019s complicated, in one word, our experience in Syria \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of having worked for President Obama. I think he championed freedom around the world. He championed our interests around the world. He demonstrated extraordinary integrity in doing so. In seriousness, obviously, two smart people agree on everything, one of them isn\u2019t thinking\u2014 that\u2019s the old clich\u00e9. And Syria is a place where I wish we had done more. And I think our experience in Syria is probably the most powerful recent argument for America caring about human rights in other countries. Because this was a small, a relatively unimportant country thousands and thousands of miles away. And one day, a bunch of teenagers; 14-, 15-year-old boys, spray some graffiti on a wall and they get picked up by the police and they get tortured and then the people of their town get pissed off and start demonstrating and then more people get arrested and then more people get angry.", "And before we know it, we have a revolution against a brutal dictator that ultimately results in millions of refugees walking to Europe, upending the politics of our closest allies, sparking in part this wave of right-wing populism that we\u2019re all struggling with right now. And, on top of that, the formation of ISIS, a terrorist movement that is worse than Al Qaeda. And all because of a dysfunctional relationship between a dictator and his people in a small country thousands of miles away. ", "So, however, folks think we should have dealt with that, and that\u2019s a really, really tough question \u2014 I think it is probably the most powerful proof that I can present that these issues should matter to the United States. ", "But you\u2019re in this job now. You were not in this position at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, but obviously, you came into the role much earlier in the game when there were more options available to the president and you and I talked throughout this period of time, including before you got the job. And you were very engaged with what are options that are real, that are concrete. How do I get support on Capitol Hill for taking various actions that might influence President Obama from your previous life as the Washington director of the Human Rights Watch, here. ", "You understood the different tools and levers available to lobby the president. You worked those. Your colleague, Samantha Power, obviously, pressed and pressed such that President Obama was reported to have essentially given up and rolled his eyes at her. What was it like? Why did President Obama, a man who, as you said, shares these values that you have? Why didn\u2019t he do more when we could have? Tell us what it was like when you were sitting at the table? ", " First of all, the debate about Syria was ultimately a debate about the hardest thing that a president has to do, and that is to make decisions about war and peace. Most of our \u2014 99 percent of our debates about human rights policy and foreign policy don\u2019t involve that kind of choice, and I think anybody who has not been the president needs to give some deference to the extraordinary burden that a preident who is command-in-chief and can send our men and women into battle has to bear. I can\u2019t speak for President Obama. I have, of course, listened to him many, many times, and I think his primary concern was rooted in our experience in Iraq. Rooted in a sense that we Americans sometimes have too much confidence in our ability to solve complicated problems in that part of the world, and sometimes we go in for the right reasons and we find ourselves stuck.", "And we find ourselves \u2014 I think he would argue, creating more problems than solving. And so, he asked a lot of, I think, legitimate questions. If we impose a no-fly zone. If we take the steps that some of us were recommending. What is the likely first, second, and third order effects?", " Was there a moment in time that you can look back on now and say, 'Wow, if only that particular meeting had gone differently?'", " I don\u2019t think there was, and I wasn\u2019t in meetings in the Oval Office at which ultimately these decisions were made. I think President Obama was simply never convinced that we could intervene against the Assad regime in a way that would resolve this situation without getting the United States of America stuck in another Middle Eastern conflict. Now, the irony is that we are now stuck in a difficult Middle Eastern conflict in Syria with not only daily airstrikes, but troops on the ground engaged in combat, which is far, far more than any proponent of humanitarian intervention Syria was proposing early on, and in my personal view, could have been avoided had we done a little bit more at an early point to stop that carnage. I cannot prove that I\u2019m right. ", "And the problem we are facing is the one that we must face today.", " I\u2019ve been particularly amazed at just how viscerally people in the region seem to take President Obama\u2019s views. There\u2019s nowhere in the world where the leaders have been so pro-Trump as in the Middle East and you go around \u2014you and I have both had this experience of talking with people in the region and there was just an absolute disregard for President Obama after eight years of this sort of grueling, trying to nudge things in a better direction at a time of arguably real unraveling in the Middle East. What do you attribute that to? Obviously, Europe has a very different point of view about Donald Trump but across the region \u2014 and this includes Israel as well as many of the Gulf States. There was a real disappointment in President Obama that was pretty palpable. Why do you think that is? Is it because he had pesky folks like you lecturing them about human rights?", " Well, it depends a lot on who you talk to. Eight years is a long time and the conflict in Syria, I think, took its toll on everybody. And it should have because it created so much harm, not just to the region but to the whole world, and everybody was frustrated with where we were on Syria at the end of the eight years of the Obama administration. But let\u2019s also be a little bit honest. The fundamental dispute that, for example, Saudi Arabia had with the Obama administration is that President Obama embraced the Arab Spring.", "And Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important priority in the last several years has not been to fight terrorism. It has not been to help the people of Syria. It has not even been to counter Iran. ", "It has been to push back these forces of rapid liberalization that the Arab Spring represented. And they never forgave us for the very simple statements that President Obama made in support of the Tahrir Square Revolution in Egypt. And by the same token, I think there are autocrats in the Middle East who see in the Trump administration a reflection of themselves. They see a president who mixes business and politics. A president who employs his family. A president who does not concern himself with values of democracy and freedom and rule of law. ", "A president whose former national security adviser could be put on one\u2019s payroll and I think there was a temporary moment in which a lot of autocratic leaders around the world breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of such an American administration. I also think that, as time goes by, they may get a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse. ", "Yeah, so tell us a little bit about that transition after this shocking election upset and it became clear to all of the tough customers in your human rights portfolio at the State Department that there was not going to be the Hillary Clinton administration that they had expected, but there was going to be a Donald Trump administration. You\u2019ve recounted one incident with a Central Asian diplomat basically chortling at this. You and your staff must have actually gotten a lot of pushback from people saying, 'Hey, there\u2019s going to be a new sheriff in town. Your finger wagging days are over.'", "Yeah, we knew the day after election day that there was really not much more that we could do and that was very, very sad and we heard about it from some of our interlocutors around the world. So you mentioned an ambassador from Central Asia who came by and saw one of my deputies and said, \u201cGosh, you guys must feel so stupid. All you\u2019ve been doing is talking democracy this and democracy that and free elections here and there, and now your own president-elect says that America\u2019s election was rigged and that 3 million people voted illegally. Gosh, you must feel so stupid.' ", "And so, I heard about this and I was a little bit pissed off. So I asked the guy to come and see me. And I said, 'I heard about what you said to my deputy. And I get where you\u2019re coming from. I know, given what Trump is saying, we\u2019re probably not going to be able to have some of the conversations with you guys that we had before about democracy. But I also want to ask you: How are you feeling?' Because again, this is a Central Asian country, and I said, 'You do realize that your country is not very important and that there\u2019s a lot of things that you like about' ...", "[Laughs] What talking from a diplomat. ", "Well, at this point, who cares? ", "Game over, yeah.", " 'You come from a small, relatively unimportant country, and you rely on the United States to back you up against your big neighbors, Russia and China. You do realize that the only reason we do that is because we have these principles. It\u2019s not because you really matter. And so, if America is going to have a transactional foreign policy where we align ourselves with big countries that can do stuff for us, you\u2019re probably going to be out of luck. How does that make you feel?'", "And he admitted that he was very, very nervous and then we had a much more honest conversation about the future. And Israel \u2014 my goodness. President Obama, I think, was pretty darn good to Israel in terms of aid and arms sales and backing them up at the U.N. \u2014 and in all kinds of other ways. But at the end of the day, Israel needs a United States of America that has authority in the world. If our relationship with our core European allies is shredded, that is not good for Israel. We\u2019re not going to be able to defend Israel if we are alone in the world. America First is not a great recipe for an effective partnership with Israel and protecting it against all of the threats that it faces. And virtually every country in the world, including the autocracies needs something from America that we give because we have a good heart, not just because we are self-interested. And I think \u2014 it\u2019s only been a few weeks and already some of the buyer\u2019s remorse may be setting in. ", "Well, what I\u2019m struck by is that, of course, these tensions always existed in American foreign policy and even in a democratic administration like the one you served in, it\u2019s not easy to balance those things. I\u2019m thinking of your own experience in Bahrain. Maybe we should talk about that when you were assistant secretary. Of course, that\u2019s a place that is very important to the Pentagon. It\u2019s very important to our strategic position in the Persian Gulf. The American 5th Fleet is headquartered there and what happened when you came to town and tried to meet with people they didn\u2019t want you to meet with.", "Nothing. What are you talking about? [Laughs] Our relationship with Bahrain is strong and solid and there\u2019s no problem. ", "Tom, you\u2019re not the assistant secretary.", "Oh, sorry. You\u2019re right..", "Put your other hat on, please.", "Well, there was that minor incident in which I was kicked out the country. I do recall now. Thank you for reminding me. So, yeah, Bahrain is an interesting case. It\u2019s important to us because we have a military base there, a very important strategic relationship. But it\u2019s also a country that is roughly evenly divided between Shia and Sunni. Actually, more Shia than Sunni \u2014 but it is ruled by a Sunni monarchy and naturally, the Shia majority would like to have more representation in the government. ", "We felt very, very strongly that it would be good for Bahrain and good for the Middle East as a whole for this country to live up to its stated commitment to political inclusion. To show this divide between Sunni and Shia can be overcome through democracy rather than something that can only be managed by one side dominating the other side. And so, we felt we had both security interests in a partnership with Bahrain but also security interests in nudging them toward greater democracy. ", "I went, interestingly, at their invitation, to go talk to them about this stuff and it was Ramadan and during Ramadan in Bahrain, there\u2019s a tradition of the Majlis where people, families, organizations, have receptions in their homes and you go and you pay your respects in the evening. And I started my trip by going to the Ramadan reception, the Majlis, of the main moderate Shia opposition party, Al-Wefaq, at which I had a conversation with the opposition leader, primarily about soccer and the World Cup, and we were laughing about that and pictures were snapped. ", "It showed up on social media and hard-liners in the Bahraini government flipped out, accusing me of meeting with the opposition before I met with the government, and I was PNGed by Twitter. PNG means \u201cpersona non-grata.\u201d", "When that happens to a diplomat, it\u2019s a big deal.", " It\u2019s a big deal. I think I am the first and probably still the only diplomat in the history of the world to have been PNGed by Twitter. It\u2019s a great honor. I\u2019m very proud. Thank you, Bahrain. ", "But now we live in the Trump era, so more Twitter PNGing is entirely possible. ", "It\u2019s entirely possible my record might be broken. But it was interesting. There was a little diplomatic crisis over this, as you can imagine. Our government didn\u2019t take kindly to that sort of treatment of a senior U.S. diplomat. A few months later, I went back and had a really good and warm conversation with the king of Bahrain and the crown prince and the whole government. I met the opposition again. We tried really, really hard to encourage a deal in which the opposition could run in freer elections in that country. Sadly, it failed.", "And here\u2019s what I think was interesting about this: There were a lot of people who were skeptical about what we were trying to do in Bahrain. Some of them felt that we really didn\u2019t have enough influence to really effectively promote democratic change in a country that was so arguably set in its autocratic ways. Other people argued, 'Well, we had influence but we just weren\u2019t using enough of it. We weren\u2019t trying hard enough.' Because it didn\u2019t seem like we were succeeding. Things remained bad. Now, Trump goes to Saudi Arabia. He meets with the king of Bahrain and instead of gently nudging him to respect human rights, he explicitly tells the king, 'We are not going to have this problem with you anymore. This is no longer an issue between us.'", "And within a few days, the government or Bahrain launches a much more violent and brutal and complete crackdown on dissent, free press, political opposition. And what that shows, to me, is that sometimes the measure of our success, when we promote these values overseas, is not a gloriously free and fair election, a glorious transformation to freedom and democracy, though sometimes that happens. Sometimes all we can do is just maintain a little bit of deterrence to keep the subject of human rights on the minds of the rulers in that country so that they feel like there are still some norms they can\u2019t break. There are still some lines that they can\u2019t cross. ", " So your role in the Obama administration was really \u2014 it was sort of like a journalist. I\u2019m thinking of that scene in ", "where the pesky kid gets beaten up by all of the other kids. That\u2019s usually the role of the journalist. But basically, the human rights guy at the table is kind of like that too. So when you don\u2019t have that guy around ...", "Well, it\u2019s not so much that human rights are cut when this is absent from our foreign policy. Things get a lot worse in the world. I think one of the ...", "Just to push back on that a little bit, when you were in this role did you feel like that they thought, 'Oh, here they go again. This is the price of doing business with the Americans that I have to have these people like Tom come and lecture me about the' ...", "Sometimes, but that\u2019s because I had the backing of the president and the secretary of state and the country and the Congress.", " That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That was the price of doing business with America was to listen to people like you. ", " But they were sensitive to what we had to say in most of these countries. There were a couple of places where I just felt like it\u2019s not worth going because all it would be is meeting with a bored official who just wants to get off ...", " Check a box?", "Check a box. But I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019d go to an autocratic country and have intense conversations, debates with presidents, the head of the secret police, the interior minister; conversations that would go on for hours in which they were striving with all of their might to try to justify themselves or to try to convince me that what they were doing was either different from what I thought or the right thing to do. And what that taught me \u2014 and I think this is a really important insight. Is that dictators are a lot more insecure about their legitimacy than elected leaders. ", "You get elected president of the United States or France, you don\u2019t have to be insecure about your legitimacy because it comes ...", "Well, we have one right now who is insecure, Tom, but ...", " Well, that\u2019s a unique circumstance but if you got elected fair and square, then you have a right to rule for your term. But most dictators know darn well that they\u2019re not legitimate so they desperately want our approval and they desperately want to avoid our disapproval. I was lobbied so many times by governments around the world to not issue public statements about their human rights record.", "They would send diplomats and say, 'Oh, Tom, I know you guys have these concerns but don\u2019t say anything publicly because it would be really counterproductive.' And every time they did that, it convinced me that we probably should issue that public statement because for whatever reason, they are really insecure about being called out. And when that stops \u2014 and this is, I think, maybe the silver lining in the current circumstances: that we are, for the next couple of years, going to be running a controlled experiment in what it means for the United States to be absent as a moral leader around the world. ", "The bad news is a lot of people are going to be harmed because of this. The good news, I hope, at the end of it is that we will see as clearly as we have never seen before the value of America playing that role because we will see the consequences of our absence. And if that\u2019s what we have to go through to understand clearly the value of America playing a principled role on the world stage and working with our allies to advance these values, then perhaps something good can come of this. ", "I always did think you had to be a pretty big optimist to take this kind of role and to take up human rights as your profession. Just quickly, because there\u2019s so much I want to ask you about what\u2019s happening right now. But why did you pick up human rights as your profession? It\u2019s an unusual career to make. There are a lot of people who talk about it but very few who actually spend their lives doing it. How did you come to this?", "Well, I think it\u2019s fun having arguments with dictators [laughs]. Very few get to do it as often as I have. ", " Well, and which dictator were you most interested to meet, by the way? ", " Well, that\u2019s a good question. I never got to spar with Putin. That would have been fun.", "I\u2019ve met Putin.", " ", " Well, you can tell me about that. But it\u2019s not ...", " I asked him about Chechnya, by the way. I was the skunk at the garden party in his first interview with Western reporters. And I was one of the most junior ones. This was in the spring of 2001. So they had gotten almost two-thirds of the way around the table before the question got to me, and no one had asked him about Chechnya and human rights, so I felt that I had to.", "Yeah, well, often, it\u2019s not the leader of the country that\u2019s most interesting. It could be the head of the police or even the head of the secret police and as you know from your Russian experience, often the smartest people in these countries are given the domestic internal security function. And it\u2019s interesting to me how folks like that often want to talk about what they do. I had a fascinating three-hour meeting with the head of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s secret police once before I was at the State Department. And we went at it on imprisoning dissidents, on torture and whether it was effective or not and he was as fascinated to meet me as I was fascinated to meet him.", "And do you ever convince somebody in a meeting like that? Of course not.", "But I always wanted to use those meetings to get it into the heads of these people that they are being watched, that somebody in the world who has power knows what they are doing, and that there may be at some point, as a consequence of those facts, consequences for that person if they cross a certain line. And again, taking that away, it\u2019s a radical change. ", "So I look back on being a diplomat and I think about all of the amazing, interesting conversations with leaders around the world and officials and how fascinating the issues were. Sometimes, I have to remind myself of the silly moments and how sometimes the dominant feeling you have is just being exhausted and you\u2019re going from meeting to meeting to meeting in a foreign country or perhaps doing what we used to call \u201cdiplomatic speed dating\u201d at the U.N., where you have 10 meetings a day with different countries for seven or eight days straight.", " This is every September when the U.N. General Assembly meets.", "That\u2019s right, and I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I probably had a lot of meetings with government ministers from other countries where I just didn\u2019t even know the name of the person I was meeting with \u2014 and it was on my briefing paper, but you forget. And a funny version of this happened at the U.N. when I was scheduled to meet \u2014 it was on my schedule \u2014 with the president of Burkina Faso, President Compaor\u00e9, the now former leader of that country, and he\u2019d been in power for decades and was trying to extend his stay by another term, contrary to his constitution. And back in that time, we had a policy of encouraging leaders all over the world to respect their constitutions; to leave when their term limits were up.", "And so I show up at his suite outside his door, and I see this gentleman walking down the hall toward us, and he sees me and he greets me, and says, 'Oh, are you here to see me?' And I said, 'Yes.' And I looked at him and I had once briefly met President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso and this did not look like President Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, but I wasn\u2019t sure. So he led me into the suite and we sat down and we started this bilateral meeting. And I\u2019m still not sure who this man is and it is important to know because usually, you\u2019re talking about policy. 'Your government should pull its troops out of here or your government should release that political prisoner.'", "But here, I\u2019m talking about you, Mr. President, should leave office and so the personal pronoun becomes very important! And I\u2019m struggling for about five minutes, and then I notice to my relief, that he\u2019s wearing a small U.N. nametag, and I strained my eyes to look at it without appearing to strain my eyes to look at it and I noticed that it\u2019s the foreign minister of Burkina Faso and not the president. And I managed to adjust quickly enough to say that \"he\" should leave office rather than \"you, Sir.\" ", " Did the president even show up? ", "No, he never did.", "And did he leave office?", "He was made to leave office by his people. Had he listened to us, he would be in a much better shape right now. ", " Right, he was in a spate of coups, as I remember what happened a few years ago.", "And I thought to myself, You know, we are sometimes arrogant as Americans. I wonder if any visiting diplomat ever comes to Washington and sits down with our secretary of state and he\u2019s wondering to himself, 'Is this Kerry? Or is this Obama? Is this Obama? Who is this?'", "Is this Biden [laughter]?", "But you started this because you had a fascination with dictators and with autocratic societies.", "No, no, no. I skipped to something that was fun about it. I am interested in political change in autocratic societies. I was born in Poland when it was a Communist country. I was very inspired watching it as a kid in the Solidarity Revolution move toward democracy. I\u2019ve seen in my own experience the role that America plays in people\u2019s imaginations around the world, and so it gives me a lot of pride now. Especially as an immigrant to America to now ...", "And you came here when?", " I was 6 years old, and I do have that kind of immigrants' \u2014 the simple love of this country. And the idea that I could get on a plane and speak to a foreign leader with all of the might and majesty of the United States of America behind me, as a representative of our president, on behalf of our values. That makes me feel \u2014it was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever had a chance to do. And you\u2019ve asked some questions that suggest that this is a frustrating line of work to be in and actually, I don\u2019t see it that way. I think foreign policy, in general, is frustrating. Most of what we try to do that\u2019s interesting in the world, whether it\u2019s on human rights or countering proliferation or terrorism. Most of the stuff fails most of the time. I always said to my team at the State Department that it\u2019s kind of like baseball and if you\u2019re successful 30 percent of the time, you\u2019re going to the hall of fame because that\u2019s a .300 average.", "I also used to tell the folks in the Human Rights Bureau, which is what I ran \u2014 that 'you guys work for the part of the State Department that loses the most battles of any other part of the State Department.' And I pause and let that sink in and then I\u2019d say, 'You also work for the part of the State Department that wins the most battles of any other part of the organization. Now, how can that be? Because you pick the most battles of anyone. You\u2019re working on these really hard issues that inherently involve friction between us and those in the diplomatic apparatus who are mostly focused on maintaining relations with other states.' ", "And inherently, it causes friction between the United States and those other states. And so it\u2019s hard and you have to fight all the time. But we do win a lot of these fights as a country and when we do, it\u2019s one of the most satisfying things in the world. ", "So what on Earth is going on with these folks? If you had to fight a lot of fights in the previous administration, what is happening to your former colleagues now? What did you tell them as you left and left them to Donald Trump?", "You make it sound as if ...", "I know you didn\u2019t have a choice but to leave. ", " Yeah, that\u2019s true. I had to abandon ship. I told them ...", "And you were there right up until January 20th, I should note. ", "I did, and I probably spoke to almost everybody on my large team about the difficulties ahead and I told them invariably that they should stay if they were career civil servants or foreign service officers, that they should do their best to do their duty under a new president. That there would be a lot of good people coming in with Trump that probably disagreed with him on a lot of stuff, and that there would probably be opportunities to make things better. And if they got to a point where that wasn\u2019t possible; well, then they could reevaluate. ", "Right now, I think they\u2019re all in a really, really tough spot. And I don\u2019t just mean people in the Human Rights Bureau but our entire diplomatic family. I think the choice that our career diplomats are facing right now is basically this: No. 1, you can try to make things better at the margins, while explaining to your foreign counterparts that they need to bear with us. As Secretary Mattis did on a recent trip to Australia. Or you can try to lay low and work on some country or program that the president hopefully is not going to notice. And there\u2019s a lot the State Department does every day that Donald Trump is not going to think about.Or you can resign. ", "We saw a resignation just this last week with the number two \u2014 the acting ambassador in Beijing, who resigned citing the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Do you think we should expect more of that?", "I fear more of that. For the sake of the country, I hope nobody resigns because rebuilding a professional foreign and civil service is going to be really, really difficult if it, in fact, is eroded by this craziness. So I hope for our sake that folks find a way to stay. But obviously, if you are the person in that position, you have to also think about your own life and career and your own conscience. ", "Were there ways that you thought about at the time to sort of Trump-proof the system when it came to human rights? We can talk about your views on Russia. It\u2019s been reported that you and a colleague went up to Capitol Hill to talk to Sen. Cardin, who has been a big supporter of sanctions against Russia and human rights policy to talk about what could happen in order not to have the Trump administration lift sanctions on Russia. Tell us a little bit about that effort and why you think he hasn\u2019t lifted sanctions on Russia yet and then we can talk about other kinds of issues like that, where it may make a difference. ", " I think he wanted to lift sanctions. He said he did. It wasn\u2019t a surprise when we learned in the first few days of the new administration that his team was asking for options. ", "That\u2019s right. You and I talked about it at the time.", "That\u2019s right, and again, I was shocked in a way, because I thought it was a terrible idea but I was not surprised because after all, it was what he said he would do. ", " And in your view, this is very much connected with his affinity with Putin? ", "I do. I don\u2019t know about collusion. I don\u2019t know if there was a deal, but I actually think even if there was, it goes beyond that. I think Trump is basically driven by a desire to be liked and not to be disapproved of. And the Saudis and the Emiratis like him and they don\u2019t wag their fingers at him. Putin said nice things about him and our European allies that have bled and sacrificed with us in every war since the beginning of the last century; he senses that they disapprove of him and so, therefore, they\u2019re bad.", "I don\u2019t think it goes that much beyond that. I also think just Putin and Trump in some ways are similar characters. They both have authoritarian instincts. So I think there is a mutual sympathy there. I think he also likes big countries more than small countries and when you see the world in transactional terms, Russia is a much more important potential friend than say, Lithuania. Russia can do a lot more for us or to us than Lithuania. So it makes sense from that point of view. ", "So you went up to see Cardin. What was the goal of that?", "I told Sen. Cardin and others on Capitol Hill that I had heard that they were indeed moving in this direction. That they should exercise their authority to call in State Department officials for briefings to ask them what\u2019s going on. And at that point, the State Department would then tell them what\u2019s going on. And I encouraged them to move forward legislation that would codify into law the sanctions that President Obama had imposed by executive order, which Sen. Cardin, with a large bipartisan group of co-sponsors; Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain proceeded to do.

Mike Flynn and the growing pressure of the Russia investigation combined to stay the president\u2019s hand.", "Was that the only issue that you felt was warranting of that level of kind of emergency attention at that point in time?

That you endeavored to make sure that people on Capitol Hill had copies of this? ", "Yeah, absolutely and again, we\u2019re not talking about leaks here. We\u2019re talking about senior members of Congress who had a right to know and who had access, but who needed to know what to ask for and so that was done and I think it was the right thing to do. After, of course, then after President Trump took over, there were a number of executive orders from the awful Muslim travel and refugee ban that a number of us rallied to try to oppose. There were other things that had been suggested that didn\u2019t happen. The planned designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, for example.

", "I think the biggest thing and they tried to do it was the travel ban, which I thought was transparently an effort to limit travel to and immigration to the United States from Muslim majority countries that did not do business with the Trump organization. And I mean that literally because that was the distinction. He did not do this to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates or to Egypt or to countries which were on his nice list because he had these relationships.", "Well, look, this is obviously, a good example also of where it\u2019s not just Congress who are an external advocacy but the court\u2019s system is clearly going to make that decision. ", "Well, ultimately the courts did and I think, again, silver linings. I think we had an effort by a president to do something that was un-American and unconstitutional and that sent a very terrible message to the world about our own commitment to democracy and the rule of law. But then, our institutions responded marvelously. And in that case, the courts have so far prevented the president from implementing this order and I hope the rest of the world sees that as an example of what is good and strong about American democracy.

The rest of the world is experiencing a lot of schadenfreude these days when it comes to what\u2019s happening inside the United States. But let me close by putting it back on you for a little bit of a lightning round. We are kind of distracted here in Washington by this sort of spectacle of the Trump White House and the leaks and who is up and who is down. What are a couple of places in the world that you think we should be paying more attention where we\u2019re not so distracted? Are there things that we\u2019re missing because of this big set of stories here at home?

And yet, I feel like, 'You know what? We\u2019ve got to take care of our business here because if America \u2014 there are things happening in the United States right now that make it impossible for the United States to effectively promote peace, democracy, rule of law, stability, around the world.'", "Our strength comes first and foremost from the example that we set and the questions about the integrity of our own democracy have to be settled, I think, before we can effectively play that role again. And yet, our State Department, our Defense Department, they still have to try to maintain a holding pattern in situations of crisis around the world. So yeah, no one is paying attention to Burma. No one is paying attention to Sri Lanka. How much time are we even spending on Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have been huge priorities for the United States? There\u2019s a humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic. The Ukraine. I think we have a Ukraine policy, but we used to have a State Department that was intensely engaged in trying to help that critical country in crisis build a stronger, more stable democracy.

It turned out to be White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon, not yet banished from Trump\u2019s inner circle, had a surprising story to tell the wonky scholar of American foreign policy: Mead, he said, was the reason President Andrew Jackson\u2019s portrait now occupied a controversial place of honor in Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office.", "Story Continued Below", "Bannon had seized on Mead\u2019s work as part of his war on the other factions inside Trump\u2019s White House, and especially the hyperentitled family members like son-in-law Jared Kushner and \u201cglobalists\u201d like national security adviser H.R. McMaster he viewed as selling out Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision to the more conventional course preferred by the Washington establishment. In the rumpled Mead and his writings about the \u201cJacksonian\u201d tradition in American foreign policy, Bannon saw a populist kindred spirit\u2014and a suitably rabble-rousing model for the anti-establishment course he hoped Trump would follow.", "Trump agreed, which is why the Jackson portrait went up and the president was visiting Old Hickory\u2019s Tennessee home within weeks of his inauguration, never mind the instant outcry that greeted Trump\u2019s embrace of a slave-holding, Native American-fighting early 19th century predecessor as his role model. \u201cThat\u2019s what Steve Bannon told me,\u201d Mead recalled in a new interview for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs. \u201cThere was this Jacksonian moment.\u201d", "Even now, exactly a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead says that while Bannon has been purged from the White House, Bannonism\u2014and by extension the bowdlerized, 21st century version of Jacksonianism he was peddling\u2014has not. If you want to understand Trump\u2019s otherwise incomprehensible presidency, Mead argues, you need to understand America\u2019s seventh president.", "\u201cThe Steve Bannon side of the Trump presidency remains very Jacksonian. Bannon isn\u2019t in the White House, and he\u2019s not welcome I think, but his influence is still felt,\u201d Mead says. \u201cTrump\u2019s base remains Jacksonian. And Trump knows how to play to this base. So even as Trump has kind of adjusted in some ways to the necessities of the Washington establishment and, you know, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t just completely reinvent American foreign policy,\u2019 he continues to orient in this way.\u201d", "After all, Mead notes, Bannon may be gone, but as for the president, \u201cHe still has a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in the Oval Office.\u201d", "***", " it wasn\u2019t just Steve Bannon who took a newfound interest in Andrew Jackson\u2014and Walter Russell Mead. Suddenly, old copies of Mead\u2019s 2001 book, ", ", were being pulled off shelves by those who hoped to understand Trump, and Mead\u2019s essays in places like ", " and ", " and columns in the ", " were soon required reading among those Republicans, like the young hard-liner Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who sought to advise Trump and harness his message of economic nationalism and deep skepticism of immigrants and internationalists. (\u201cInsights that have stood the test of time,\u201d Cotton said of Mead, recommending his book to listeners of The Global Politico last fall; the two have become so close that Mead attended Cotton\u2019s 40th birthday party last spring.)", "For Washington\u2019s political class, Mead provided an answer to explain the otherwise perplexing populist appeal of the brash billionaire. Jacksonianism, as Mead viewed it, was exactly the historical precedent to explain Trump, marrying grass-roots disdain for elites, deep suspicion of overseas entanglements\u2014and obsession with America power and sovereignty. \u201cHe is not the second coming of Andrew Jackson,\u201d Mead said when we talked on the eve of Trump\u2019s first anniversary in office this weekend. \u201cBut there was such a hunger in America for a Jacksonian figure that people were willing to project a lot of qualities onto this sort of very unlikely Queens real estate developer who becomes the folk hero of Americans who hate New York and are suspicious of Big Business.\u201d", "In explaining the historical antecedents for Trump\u2019s hostility toward free trade, establishment-bashing and embrace of a certain kind of chauvinist nationalism, Mead offered an intellectual framework to understand Trump at a time when others remained simply mystified by the president. Indeed, Mead found Trump\u2019s antagonism toward the fundamentals of the post-Cold War international order; rejection of alliances and allies; and visceral disregard for international institutions and the robust free trade made possible by it all perfectly consistent with the attributes of Jacksonianism he had first described more than a decade earlier.", "For \u201ca scholar of foreign policy,\u201d says Mead, who is today a distinguished fellow at the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute, watching Trump\u2019s rise was sort of an out-of-body experience, a once-in-a-career moment \u201cwhere these abstract typologies that you write about suddenly seems to be happening in front of you.\u201d", "Jackson is one of four American historical figures Mead sees as archetypes of American foreign policy\u2014but, like Trump today, he has historically been far from the mainstream. Ever since World War II, Mead argues, politicians coming from the more idealistic, democracy-promoting, free-trade-worshiping ranks of Wilsonians and Hamiltonians have reigned over Washington. Jacksonians and more libertarian-minded Jeffersonian realists have largely been relegated to the sidelines, or reluctantly enlisted in foreign adventures when they seemed justified by the bigger ideological struggle against communism in the Cold War.", "But with the Cold War over, that liberal internationalist approach finally flopped with the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Mead argues, giving Trump the political opening he seized. Bush and his neocons \u201chad little to no real success,\u201d Mead says, with their Wilsonian project of using American power to build a more democratic Middle East. Obama, while more cautious about democracy-building, got sucked in too, leaving \u201cwreckage\u201d abroad and dismayed voters at home. \u201cThe gap between the establishment predictions about where the world would go and then the reality of where the world is opened a gap that enabled Trump basically to run as the little boy saying the emperor has no clothes,\u201d Mead says.", "The problem, however, is that Trump was hardly prepared to govern\u2014which has largely been the story of his first year in office. \u201cHe ran essentially on a negative agenda, that the establishment didn\u2019t know what it was doing. And his proposals tended to be pretty vague and often contradictory,\u201d Mead says. \u201cSo, yeah, now he has the difficulty of, you know, \u2018How do you govern?\u2019 This is always the problem for populism: Once you\u2019re in office, what do you do?\u201d", "Trump\u2019s embrace of Jackson as a governing philosophy has been decidedly controversial. To critics, it\u2019s barely veiled racism, a signaling to Trump\u2019s overwhelmingly white political base that is hardly subtle considering Jackson\u2019s rapidly declining historical reputation. A slave owner and general once celebrated as the conquering hero of the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson is perhaps better known today as a fighter against Native Americans whose tactics were so brutal that the Obama administration announced in 2016 it was booting him from the $20 bill. When Trump recently hosted Native American leaders in the Oval Office and pictures circulated of them standing with the Jackson portrait in the background, Twitter was filled with commentary about the president\u2019s boorish slight of his guests.", "In our interview, Mead acknowledges the \u201cxenophobic\u201d side of Jacksonian populism and says that it has often been a \u201cwhites-only\u201d political movement, but he argues most mainstream scholars\u2014and politicians\u2014have made a mistake by seeking to condemn this key segment of the electorate rather than trying to understand it. \u201cAmerica wouldn\u2019t be a democracy without Jacksonian populism,\u201d Mead says, arguing that it is Jacksonians who tend to fight and win America\u2019s wars, regardless of how enthusiastic they are about starting them. \u201cIn its more negative moments, you can call it xenophobic. And yet somehow the health of our democracy historically has rested in many ways on exactly this sometimes quite problematic strain in American politics.\u201d", "Even now, a year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mead argues that many establishment types remain confounded by Trump and his erratic approach to foreign policy because they continue to ignore the political imperatives demanded by his Jacksonian base. For example, Mead argues that Trump\u2019s tough talk about the world and penchant for appointing top advisers from the ranks of former generals doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he will end up as a more militaristic president than others, but should be seen as effective political appeals to a base that respects the military more than other American institutions and sees the outside world as a source of threat and fear rather than opportunity.", "\u201cAndrew Jackson\u2019s actual foreign policy was a lot less inflammatory than his rhetoric. And I think Trump, for one thing, understands that Jacksonians like for America to sound tough. They don\u2019t like long, grinding wars, inconclusive wars. And, in fact, they would rather not fight wars unless America is attacked,\u201d Mead explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s logical in a way and it builds to his base for Trump to take a tough line, but he\u2019s been rather cautious about where does he actually commit troops and how much war is he willing to get into.\u201d", "Then again, Mead acknowledges, Trump\u2019s approach to the world really has been confusing during his first year in office\u2014at least in part because many of the president\u2019s top advisers, like McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Defense Secretary James Mattis, don\u2019t seem to share it. There may be a Jacksonian in the Oval Office, but he\u2019s often outnumbered when he gets to the Situation Room.", "\u201cTrump\u2019s foreign policy team,\u201d Mead concedes, \u201cis not very Trumpian.\u201d", "***", " is Walter Russell Mead.", "When Bannon called Mead late one night last summer, he seemed to think he had gotten an intellectual fellow traveler on the phone as he credited Mead with the White House\u2019s Jackson infatuation and that portrait on the Oval Office wall.", "Eventually, Mead decided to disabuse him of that notion. The historian may be an essential guide to understanding Trump as his bizarre brand of politics continues to confound and confuse much of the rest of the world. But he\u2019s not a Trump supporter.", "As he told Bannon, \u201cWell, you know, Steve, I write about Jacksonianism. That doesn\u2019t mean I ", " a Jacksonian,\u201d Mead remembers telling the Trump strategist. Not only that, but \u201cactually, I voted for Clinton in the election.\u201d", "Bannon, he said, was a \u201clittle bit shocked.\u201d", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    Updated ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                                ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

But the belated rebuke of Putin was short and cryptic enough that it seemed to underscore the strange mystery of why Trump, while allowing his government to pursue an increasingly confrontational series of policies aimed at countering Russia, has never publicly disavowed his oft-stated admiration for the strongman leader who ordered his spies to intervene in the U.S. election on Trump\u2019s behalf.", "Tweet or no tweet, as Trump now contemplates a retaliatory strike on Putin\u2019s Syrian partner, it\u2019s more clear than ever that Russia remains the signal foreign policy dilemma of the Trump presidency \u2013 the issue on which the president has split, repeatedly, with top advisers like his now-booted secretary of state and national security adviser. Just a few days ago, Trump spoke once again, if a bit plaintively, about his desire to get along with Putin even as his administration was putting out a tough new round of sanctions hitting Putin\u2019s inner circle. And of course there\u2019s the matter of that Russian election intervention \u2013 and the still ongoing investigations of whether Trump or his campaign team knew about it.", "I talked Russia, Russia, Russia for this week\u2019s Global Politico with the journalist Julia Ioffe, a Russia-born reporter who is one of the few to have covered both Putin\u2019s Moscow and Trump\u2019s Washington. We covered everything from why she thinks Russia is just as much ", "as it is ", "to what Washington consistently gets wrong about it, to why Putin has been so successful at playing four straight American presidents. ", "\u201cI\u2019m very scared,\u201d Ioffe tells me of the brewing confrontation between the two blustery leaders. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m scared is because\u2026 in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just\u2014the way things were done. \u2026 Now \u2026 you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful. Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent. And I worry that they\u2019re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage.\u201d ", "In a confrontation, she argues, Putin may well prove a smarter actor on the world stage than the American president who had started out hoping to be friends. \u201cYou know, this isn\u2019t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs,\u201d Ioffe says. \u201cAnd this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he\u2019s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist.

Fulsome is what I was aiming for.", "You\u2019re making me blush.", " But I have to say, first of all, I need to make a little announcement of my own, because it will help to explain what this episode of The Global Politico", "is about.", "So, this will be not our last, but our second-to-last episode of The Global Politico, at least with me as host. It may go on a bit of a hiatus, but I\u2019m going to make a little bit of a career change, and work full-time at ", " as a staff writer. I\u2019ll be contributing to their New Yorker Radio Hour. But The Global Politico in its current iteration, sadly, will only have this episode and the next episode. And I thought, given that, that we really ought to devote the full conversation today to Russia. It\u2019s been an ongoing theme ever since we launched The Global Politico", "We launched The Global Politico within days of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration last year, in 2017, and the idea was really to help make sense of this disrupted world, and what kind of a foreign policy was Donald Trump going to have. We all knew that it would be different than what came before, and every week it\u2019s been sort of variations on a theme of just how different has it been. ", "And yet, throughout that, the consistency with which we have talked about Russia\u2014not only, of course, because I was a former correspondent in Moscow\u2014but because it has been a theme in many ways, both of the politics of the Trump administration, with the Russiagate investigation still underway, but also because it has remained the most perplexing foreign policy question. Donald Trump to this day has never personally moved beyond his public admiration for Vladimir Putin, his praise for him, and yet his administration has talked tough, has really undertaken a policy toward Russia that isn\u2019t all that different from what a Democratic or a Republican administration might do, faced with the same set of facts. ", "So the conundrum of trying to understand what the heck is going on with Russia has remained this enduring obsession. So we\u2019ve had many great episodes about Russia. We\u2019ll talk about some of those today, some of the highlights, and Julia and I will try to make sense of it. ", " One of the things\u2014right, Julia\u2014that from the beginning has been so weird about Trump and Russia is that on one hand, Washington has never been more obsessed with Russia in some ways, and yet, it\u2019s very ignorant about Russia, too. ", "So how do you square that circle? You were born in Russia. You emigrated here. You then returned after you graduated from college as a working journalist to Moscow.", "To work for you at ", " ", ".", " And then you came back here to Washington. So, we are kind of unusual in that we both have covered both Washington and Moscow. That\u2019s not true of all that many people. What do you make of Washington\u2019s Russia obsession these days?", "Well, personally, I find it deeply frustrating. It\u2019s one of those cases where what are we talking about when we talk about Russia? And usually, the answer is not Russia, but we\u2019re talking about ourselves in the same way that when Russians obsess about America; they\u2019re not really obsessing about America, they\u2019re obsessing about themselves but refracted through this external lens.", "And it\u2019s funny to see this country described as this kind of Bondian nexus of evil where everything is super-organized, Putin is this master strategist who just has everything planned out from A to Z, and is able to follow through piece by piece on his strategy or on his agenda, and that everything is just\u2014I mean, it\u2019s basically the Soviet Union mixed with ", " mixed with some James Bond. ", "And I don\u2019t know about you\u2014you spent a lot of time there, too\u2014I don\u2019t recognize that Russia, you know. The Russia I know is a lot more like ", ", mixed with some James Bond stuff, right? It\u2019s a lot of things. And I think I sometimes overcompensate in the other direction, where I\u2019m like, you guys are just not that good. They\u2019re not that competent. ", "Well, this is a great starting point, actually, for our first segment of our conversation today, which is about the Russia as it actually is, and what do we really think about Vladimir Putin now that he has just gotten another six-year term? He\u2019s already been in power for 18 years. He\u2019s already, in fact, become the longest-serving Russian leader since Josef Stalin. ", "Here, in the West, the impression that people have is that Putin runs the whole country. This is not so, at all.", "\u2026people so easily accept this myth about this great and horrible Putin.", "I was in Russia a few months ago talking to Russians, both those who I would say are more supportive of the government and those who aren\u2019t. And all of them, to a man and woman, said, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand why you Americans are so obsessed with what Russia may or may not have done.\u201d They said, \u201cYou\u2019ve now made us into this colossus, as if we kind of control what\u2019s happening in the United States. You\u2019re really attributing to our leadership, to the Kremlin, to Putin, whatever, much greater power than we think they have.\u201d\u2026 So there\u2019s a real puzzlement there about the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.", "So I picked out a few of our interviews over the last year on The Global Politico", "that really go to this question of, are we really talking about Russia as it actually exists today? And it was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Russian wealthiest man\u2014he was then imprisoned by Vladimir Putin\u2014now a dissident who lives in London. He called it this \u201cmyth of the great and horrible Putin.\u201d", " Which is so interesting because he lost a decade of his life to this horrible Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin was, in fact, very horrible to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Vladimir Putin is horrible in a lot of ways, but here if you read the discussion or you listen to the discussion about Russia, you\u2019re not hearing about those ways. And, again, I think as you and I have talked about a lot, it\u2019s a lot about how we imagine our adversary as Americans; and for somebody to be able to come in and mess with our elections, or to stymie us in geopolitics and take over our traditional kind of\u2014I hate to use this term\u2014spheres of influence, they have to be a really mighty enemy, right? ", "They have to be really, really good. Otherwise are we not very good if we\u2019re stymied by some kind of tin-pot dictator, banana republic, where things are kind of held together with shoelaces and gum?", "Well, one of the things that you pointed out already that I think really drives a lot of this is that Americans tend to forget that while it\u2019s an authoritarian political system, it\u2019s still a political system, and Vladimir Putin is often responding to his internal need to maintain himself and his government and his regime in power, and there\u2019s another clip from Khodorkovsky where he made that point, where he said, Look, this is Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign platform, America-bashing. When he\u2019s fighting in Syria; when he\u2019s fighting in Ukraine\u2014he\u2019s fighting against the big bad West. It\u2019s a war between Russia and the West; it\u2019s not a war between Russians and Ukrainians.", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a very key thing to understand. When you\u2019re in Russia, what you hear about is, did Putin do this for external consumption or internal consumption? And a lot of I think what we don\u2019t understand is that a lot of times the song is not about us. A lot of times it\u2019s done for an internal audience, to shore up his domestic support. I mean, I think it\u2019s really telling that much of the Russian news today is not really about what\u2019s happening in Russia, not about a stagnant economy, not about corruption, not about rotten infrastructure. It\u2019s about the West, or about Russia\u2019s exploits abroad. ", "And it\u2019s about this bait-and-switch of\u2014you know, Putin\u2019s original contract with the Russian people was, you guys get wealthy or you become better off; I\u2019ll help you do that, but you in return, you stay out of politics, and you leave that to me.", "I called that his Make Russia Great Again strategy.", " Right. And then, when he returned to power in 2012, widely seen as an illegitimate return to power for his third term as president, he took on a more ideological, more revanchist kind of approach, and it became about, the economy\u2019s not doing great, but that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019re an empire again; we\u2019re great again. We are challenging the West; we are not dancing to their tune. We are not being humiliated by them and told what to do.", "And it\u2019s amazing how much it really resonates with Russians, how much it\u2019s important to them, the same way it\u2019s important to Americans to live in a great power.", "Well, and it\u2019s interesting because that was a theme of Vladimir Putin from the very beginning. So, I was there in Moscow for the first four years, basically, of Putin\u2019s presidency, when he certainly didn\u2019t have the international capabilities that he has now to basically intervene in the war in Syria, to intervene and to create a civil war on the ground in Ukraine. Back in the early 2000s, Russia really was much more of a basket case. In fact, people were still debating over, could they repay the Soviet debt in time. People were still debating over what kind of identity Putin would bring to the office of the president. ", "Well, again, it was an identity crisis, basically. We weren\u2019t sure what had happened in the first 10 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but we were pretty sure we didn\u2019t like it. And Putin came in and he played off of those feelings of insecurity and instability on the part of the Russian people. He said things are going to be stable again. But the thing that I remember so vividly that\u2019s relevant to today\u2019s conversation was that at the beginning Putin really was about restoring the Russian state internally, rebuilding power in the Kremlin. He used to call it the vertical of ", "\u2014basically, the vertical of power. And looking internally, consolidating authority; eliminating the democracy that had taken hold, if tenuously, in the first 10 years.", " Getting the oligarchs under control.", " Absolutely. Bring oligarchs under control; bring the media under control. So that was the story of the four-year period when I was there. I think what we missed, or that Putin wasn\u2019t yet ready for, was this much more internationally aggressive leader that we have today. He\u2019s now taken over Crimea\u2014that was the first armed annexation of territory since the end of World War II. ", "So, my question to you is, going forward, do you believe that now that Putin has another six-year term under his belt, is he going to be more aggressive again, internationally? Is he going to aggressively seek to revise international borders, to challenge the United States and the West elsewhere?", "I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes. I remember in 2012-2013 when the Russian economy started its kind of long decline, Russians who were very smart watching what was happening and very in tune with what has happening politically were saying, as Russia gets poorer internally, it\u2019s going to become more aggressive externally. ", "And I think that has very much been borne out since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine. Then you have Syria; you have the meddling in elections all over Europe and in the U.S., most recently being the Catalan independence movement. So, there\u2019s no referendum issue too small for Putin to get his hands in and try to kind of chip away at the transatlantic alliance, or order. ", "I think Syria and the Middle East are going to be a very interesting area to watch. Russia is now heading up the peace talks in Syria, bringing both the Turks and the Iranians to the table. America is not in those conversations at all anymore. We used to be helping to run the Geneva talks; now they\u2019ve been moved to Astana in Central Asia, in a former Soviet republic. ", "Russia talks to all sides. In the Middle East, it\u2019s seen now\u2014instead of the U.S., it\u2019s seen as the kind of reliable ally. ", "And by the way, just this week, I should point out, you have this incredible visual image of Donald Trump saying on the one hand, \u201cI want to get out of Syria immediately, as soon as possible,\u201d never mind what his advisers said or what the American policy has been. The same day, you have this incredible visual of Vladimir Putin convening regional leaders. To me, that was almost the visual representation of the post-American world order.", " Absolutely. And it\u2019s also kind of an embodiment of what Vladimir Putin wants to be and how he wants to be seen, both domestically and abroad. He wants to be seen as the great diplomat and peacemaker, and also aggressor. So, somebody who is really good with all the tools in that toolbox, that he can go to war if necessary and push back, but he is primarily the only adult in the room. ", "He\u2019s not going to start crazy, stupid wars like the Americans did in Iraq, which is constantly brought up by the Russians, when they admonished the Americans. He can convene all sides and be seen as an honest broker who actually follows through. ", " So, I think this notion of Vladimir Putin exactly as he wants to be seen is a great pivot to how he is seen in the United States today, and this Russiagate investigation. Because we\u2019re talking about Russia right now, but an awful lot of what passes for Russia conversation in Washington today, in American politics, is really not about Russia; it\u2019s about Russiagate, or whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s about the Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S. elections, the ongoing investigations of it by the Senate Intelligence Committee and, in particular, by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. ", "\"It was the hacking\u2026So, that\u2019s when the hairs really went up on the back of our necks. \u2026", "\u201cA lot of us had this Spidey sense and concerns all through \u201916 that the Russians were playing by a new playbook now, but we did not truly understand the totality of the effort\u2026\u2019", " \u201cIt\u2019s a failure of imagination that\u2019s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11. Right? \u2026", "\u201cWe moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia. So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective. And that was a cost.\u201d", "This, of course, from the very beginning of this Global Politico", "podcast has been a subject of ongoing and recurring conversations, both because it radically affects how Vladimir Putin is seen in the United States\u2014how does he want to be seen? Why did he intervene in our elections? Did he get what he wanted with Donald Trump? And then again, the seriousness of this investigation. We\u2019ve learned an awful lot in the course of the last year.", "When we started out at The Global Politico, we would have been astonished to know a lot of the information that has subsequently come out about contacts between the Trump campaign and various Russian envoys, emissaries, spies, and the like. We would be amazed to have learned, for example, about that summer 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Russians were openly promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to President Trump\u2019s own son and his top campaign officials. ", "So, let\u2019s talk Russiagate for a few minutes, and also what the Obama and Trump administrations did and didn\u2019t do about that. When I had Victoria Nuland on this show, she talked about the \u201cSpidey sense\u201d of the Russia experts inside the U.S. government, and how the hairs on the back of their necks were standing up when they started to realize in 2016 that Russia was running the same play inside the United States that it had run in many Eastern European countries already, intervening in their politics, and yet we didn\u2019t seem to recognize it. ", "So, I think\u2014again, this goes back to the idea of who is a worthy adversary to the U.S. I think the level of disbelief was also driven in fact by\u2014well, we\u2019re not Germany and we\u2019re not France and we\u2019re certainly not Hungary\u2014this can\u2019t happen here. And, in fact, it did. And as we\u2019re realizing also, with all the disclosures about Cambridge Analytica and the role that Facebook played, and earlier, the revelations about the role that Twitter played, and just the role of political advertising\u2014we\u2019re realizing that in some ways the Russians played the role of terrorists. They used our system, our own tools, against us. They were able to manipulate these openings on these platforms into pretty deft weapons.", " You know, I mean, I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because I\u2019ve been so struck by that. At the height of the Cold War, imagine that you told KGB agent Vladimir Putin or any of his bosses, \u201cAmerica itself is going to invent a tool by which you can have direct access to basically every single American\u2014certainly, every single American you\u2019d like to reach. It\u2019s basically going to be so cheap as to be free. And we will even sell you and help guide you to have the most effective use of this tool, and you will be able to\u2014", "And planting you\u2014", "Not only that, but we\u2019re going to tell you exactly what these Americans like; what they think about; who their friends are; and what kind of messages would most appeal to them. And American society will be so divided and fraught at the time that it\u2019ll be a total cakewalk to divide them further and to fan kind of the flames of division. Which is kind of how\u2014", " It would have been a KGB officer\u2019s dream.", " I mean, I\u2019ve spoken to former NSA head Michael Hayden about this, and he said, \u201cYou know, the best covert operations they don\u2019t create facts or divisions on the ground. They exacerbate the ones that are already there.\u201d And in some ways, 2016 was perfect. It was this kind of perfect storm, and the Russians just were able to push it in just the right direction. ", "I think what we still don\u2019t know\u2014to me, this is the most interesting question, and also the question that probably is completely unanswerable, is what impact did it have on the election? Did people stay home and not vote because they were Bernie supporters, and they were disgusted by what came out in the DNC hack? Did people come out and vote more for Trump because they saw these ads saying that Hillary was going to let in all these Muslims? Right? Or all these illegal immigrants.", "It\u2019s so hard to gauge, right, because everybody\u2019s decision to vote is so multifaceted and multifactorial. And that\u2019s, I think, part of the brilliance of this operation. And also because it was an operation that was, as one former Obama official said, was like throwing spaghetti at the wall. They were trying all kinds of different things, and I think this is what we also\u2014just going back to what we don\u2019t understand about the Russians\u2014we think of it as because the way we Americans would do it, we would have a clear hierarchy, a clear plan; there would be, kind of everybody would be unified in their mission and their idea of what everybody\u2019s doing. ", "But in fact, in Russia, one hand didn\u2019t know what the other hand was doing, and there was a lot of turf battles going on. As we now know from some terrific reporting from Russian reporters\u2014what\u2019s left of them\u2014and the fact that actually the Russians\u2019 strength was in their disorganization, in their flexibility, in their high appetite for risk, and the fact that they were willing to try crazy things and pivot as the situation merited. That that was actually their strength.", "Right, well, combined with the still unknown questions of how much help they received in targeting and distributing this information, either by the Trump campaign or those associated with it. And that, of course, is what still remains up in the air, and your point\u2014", "But also, the other thing is that that\u2019s also hard to determine, right? Even if they did have help from the Trump organization, and it seems that the Trump organization was happy to take help from anybody. The question is, was that the deciding factor? Or, because of the internet, in addition to, like if you went back to 1983 and talked to KGB agent Vladimir Putin, and you\u2019re like, on top of this tool they\u2019re going to call Facebook, they\u2019re also going to invent this thing called the internet, and they\u2019re going to put all their political information on line. You don\u2019t even need spies in Russia; they can just sit in Moscow\u2014", "Or St. Petersburg, with the Internet Research Agency.", " Right. And read the ", " and POLITICO and The Cook Political Report and watch all these TV channels through the internet. You don\u2019t even have to go there and flip sources, you know\u2014all this information about what districts to target, about what states are up in air, what issues are driving the conversation and are really pitting Americans against each other. It\u2019s just going to be\u2014you\u2019re just going to have this little screen, and it\u2019s going to be at your fingertips, literally. ", " No, that\u2019s exactly right. But we\u2019re still talking about the narrow question of the 2016 election and were votes swayed, and in some ways it\u2019s very unknowable. There\u2019s two other elements of this we haven\u2019t really talked about. ", "Number one, which is how much will it directly reach the level of criminal activity? How much will it directly reach the level\u2014", " And it already has, as we\u2019ve seen.", " Exactly. So, Mueller has already issued criminal indictments; there have already been guilty pleas in the case. But it still hasn\u2019t fundamentally yet answered the question of to what extent U.S. persons, and specifically those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself\u2014did they know about this, and were they involved in it? So, that\u2019s where we all sense there is a potential political explosion coming down the road.", "And then there\u2019s this question of: And so what? What is the United States supposed to do about this? And did the Obama administration handle it correctly? Was it proactive and aggressive enough in responding to it? And then of course, what\u2019s happened since then? You and I are talking on a day when there are a whole wave of new sanctions that have been finally released that target Putin\u2019s inner circle in response to this, but for God\u2019s sakes, we\u2019re talking about this is the spring of 2018, and this intervention occurred starting in late 2014, according to Bob Mueller.", " And, as some people have pointed out, by the time these sanctions came out, mostly against oligarchs, they have had plenty of time to restructure their assets in a way where they\u2019ll be minimally affected by the sanctions.", "Still, I think it\u2019s quite a strong signal, and I think the kind of underexplored and under-noticed area that I think a lot of this will come down to is the money aspect. You know, it\u2019s a truism in journalism, and it\u2019s truer than ever\u2014follow the money. And there was a story you and I talked about that came out last month on a weekend, pretty unnoticed, the Reuters investigation that rich Russians bought about $100 million of Trump property in south Florida alone. And this has been kind of bandied about on political talk shows here, about whether or not basically Donald Trump was essentially a laundromat for dirty Russian money because he didn\u2019t ask too many questions, and needed the money because American banks wouldn\u2019t lend to him.", "But, given how\u2014and this was one of the first ways that contemporary Russians took advantage of the American political system is, they make their money at home and then get it out of the country into the West, using all the things we invented almost for them. You know, LLCs, American law firms buying their property for them that are then protected by attorney-client privilege. You know, LLCs that buy LLCs that buy LLCs that buy some property in Trump Tower.", " Right. So you could never track it back.", " And if you don\u2019t have\u2014I\u2019ve been joking with some journalist friends that if I had a superpower I\u2019d want subpoena power, because otherwise it\u2019s really impossible to follow the money these days, and I think that\u2019s one of the avenues that is going to become more kind of fleshed out and filled in as the Mueller investigation continues, I hope, because I think there\u2019s going to be a lot there.", "So, one of the things since we\u2019ve been talking about Russia and the Russiagate investigation on The Global Politico", "one of the interesting things is that the politics surrounding it, on both right and left, have gotten scrambled, and you have this element of what I would call Muller-denialism that exists on the left as well as the right, people saying basically Russiagate is a distraction; it\u2019s not that serious; we shouldn\u2019t care about it; we should really focus either on the actual threats from Russia or on the problems of President Trump from the point of view of the left don\u2019t have to do with Russia; they have to do with what Trump is doing in the United States.", "Where do you come down on that debate, because it\u2019s a pretty fierce one already?", "Yes, and it has been from the moment it kind of broke. You know, I\u2019m kind of of two minds about it. I think that the debate around it has gotten so politicized and if you\u2019re in one camp you have to say and believe the following things, and if you\u2019re in the other you have to say and believe another set of facts, or beliefs. ", "And I think the problem lies in the fact that it has become about Trump, and Trump and Republicans feel this, and so they push back. They feel, maybe correctly, that this is Democrats kind of wanting a do-over, or at the very least, undermining Trump\u2019s legitimacy. And unfortunately, yes, it is about Trump, because it was an election in which he won in a really strange way. He lost the popular vote by a massive amount of votes and then squeaked through in these areas that were completely unexpected\u2014you know, they were the blue Democratic wall in the upper Midwest.", "So, it is about Trump, but I think the media and Democrats have\u2014and I hate to lump them together\u2014but, I think they have kind of failed to make the debate not about Trump, but about national security, about the integrity of our elections, about the fact that they\u2019ll do this to anybody, they\u2019ll do this to Republicans, too, if they find that they\u2019re being too hawkish on Russia, or if they want to just stir up more chaos.", "I remember watching the Roy Moore election in Alabama, and I just thought, this is so perfect, right? All of America is watching this race in Alabama, while Russia\u2019s just cleaning up in the Middle East, at very low cost, very low cost. Like, all of our fears of intervention in Syria, Russia has shown that you can do quite effectively with very few men on the ground and very little money, actually. So, and meddling in the Catalan independence movement. ", " Right. Still a distraction.", "Right. We just become\u2014because we\u2019re prone to it the same way the Russians are prone to it\u2014we\u2019re a big country with imperial ambitions and this kind of imperialness in our DNA the way that Russians are, and it\u2019s very easy for us to turn inward and become obsessed with our own internal struggles, and not notice that the Russian thief is out back cleaning out your chicken coop. I don\u2019t know where that analogy came from, but there it is.", "Well, all right. So, let\u2019s talk about Trump. It is about Trump. And I think that\u2019s sort of our third and final aspect of our conversation today, because you can\u2019t really talk about Russia and Trump without talking about what is inside his mind. ", "First though, we\u2019re going to have a quick break, and we\u2019ll be right back with more of my conversation with Julia Ioffe right after a word from our sponsor. ", " Welcome back to The Global Politico", "As promised, Julia and I are going to talk Trump, because you can\u2019t talk about Russia and the United States today without talking about Donald Trump.", " \"so he looks at Russia, looks at Putin. He looks at the relationship that we have. I do think there is a degree of admiration for a strongman. I\u2019m sorry.\"", "\"\u2026for a person who is breaking glass and wanting to reshape the world, and thinks that so much about it is wrong, and that the Americans have gotten a bad deal, and the way we\u2019ve done things has been inappropriate -- for him to create a different kind of relationship with Russia, and especially someone who is strong like Putin, I think he views that as something that would show that he has the ability to do things that no other president has been able to do.\"", " \"it puts us in an odd position, where it\u2019s almost as if the Cold War is back, except only one side is fighting it.\u201d", "And what is with his admiration for Vladimir Putin? It was at the very beginning of The Global Politico, we had Bob Corker on the show, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And this was before he publicly broke with Trump. At the time he was still talking with Trump a lot and he was desperately trying to get inside his mind and figure out what\u2019s going on. ", "And we talked with Corker, and he had talked with Trump about Putin. And Corker said, \u201cYou know, I have to say\u2014I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2014I do think that it\u2019s a degree of admiration for a strongman,\u201d and that that is part of Trump\u2019s enduring admiration for Vladimir Putin. But, my goodness, that was back in January, February, of 2017. Here we are in April of 2018. Flash forward. Donald Trump has never to this day said something publicly critical of Vladimir Putin.", " As someone pointed out to me the other day, he is literally meaner to Meryl Streep than he is to Vladimir Putin, which is really quite something. And, on one hand I think Corker is absolutely right. I think he has an abiding fascination with and admiration for strongmen. He has been similarly kind to President Xi of China, Duterte of the Philippines, Erdogan of Turkey; he thinks that that\u2019s a good way to run a country, you know. He has attempted kind of a much paler version of what these guys do, of undermining the independent press. When SNL was mean to him in the very beginning of his administration, he publicly called into question NBC\u2019s broadcasting license. Very similar to those guys.", "That said, Erdogan, Xi, and Duterte did not intervene in the 2016 election with the overt goal of helping him win\u2014right? So, it becomes even more problematic that he won\u2019t say anything about Russia, especially because Russia continues to do crazy things.", "Well, there\u2019s also this striking\u2014call it a bifurcation, a split screen situation that\u2019s developed, where it\u2019s been one of the most revealing aspects of the gap between Donald Trump and Donald Trump\u2019s administration when it comes to foreign policy. And so you have this relatively hawkish foreign policy on Russia that\u2019s more or less supported by Democrats and Republicans. And you have the spectacle of the national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, before he was unceremoniously dumped by Trump. His last words out the door this week were a warning that the United States had failed to, in his view, adequately respond to the Russian provocations.", ": Or Rex Tillerson. I mean, this to me was just\u2014", "Recipient of the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin himself, who with his own hands pinned that thing on Tillerson\u2019s lapel, that medal on Tillerson\u2019s lapel. And that he\u2014the last thing he does\u2014it turns out that it\u2019s the last thing he does, is he says\u2014basically, he calls out Russia for the poisoning of this former Russian spy in the U.K., and then is unceremoniously dumped by President Trump the next day. And I\u2019m just getting goosebumps thinking about it all over again, because it\u2019s just\u2026", "If you\u2019re a Russiagate skeptic, which I definitely was at the beginning, it\u2019s like there\u2019s increasingly less room for skepticism, because how do you explain that? It just\u2014even the optics of it are so bad, that he\u2019s pushed out everybody who\u2019s hawkish on Russia. Or that he does these things\u2014again, you and I have talked about this a lot, about this split between the Trump administration, which says, do not congratulate when you talk to Putin. ", ": These are the famous talking points that were leaked to the ", " and probably sped up the firing of H.R. McMaster, probably. ", " This was the call that Trump made to Putin after his\u2014quote/unquote\u2014election on March 18", ", where he squeaked by with a nail-biting 77 percent of the vote, and it, again, came after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent. And the note said that the talking point said, \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d in capital letters. What does Trump do? He congratulates Putin.", "Not only that, but he invites him to the White House for a meeting.", "Well, then we find this out from the Russians.", " Right. And it\u2019s always\u2014", "We keep finding out\u2014the Russians are\u2014so, this is what I was getting to. Then Trump congratulates him. The talking points say, please scold him for the poisoning. He doesn\u2019t scold him. In fact, he invites him to a White House visit\u2014not just a visit. And the Russians are very ably playing off of this split. You know, he\u2019s basically given them a big opening to walk right into, and they\u2019re very ably playing the administration off the president that heads it to their own advantage, because the Russians, like the Chinese, love protocol. ", "All of these state visits are very important to them; the optics are very important to them, especially for Vladimir Putin, who wants to make Russia great again, who wants Russia to be seen as a peer to the U. S., and not as a junior partner in the relationship that is to be punished for things. What better image is there for him, after all of these diplomatic expulsions, after all of these sanctions, after\u2014again\u2014a poisoning on U.K. territory with a crazy nerve agent\u2014that he gets a photo op with the president of the U.S., in the White House that the president of the U.S. invited him to? But there is nothing more legitimizing than that, for the Russians. They\u2019re getting exactly what they want out of it.", "Even if the meeting never occurs, the timing of the leak, coming from the Russians, was very clearly weaponizing information that Trump himself had handed them. Why did they do it?", "It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve done it.", "And they did it to make it clear to people like us who are paying attention that Donald Trump is not on the same page with the tough policies coming out of his administration, number one. ", "Number two, that Donald Trump continues almost to this day to be privately acting in a very conciliatory fashion towards Vladimir Putin, and in fact, even seeking his approval. And Trump followed it up, by the way, rather than being ashamed or trying to hide this, what did Trump do? I think it\u2019s very notable that he spoke out publicly later and basically not only he confirmed it by saying, \u201cWell, yeah, shouldn\u2019t we get along with Russia?\u201d which is what he\u2019s been saying ever since the campaign.", " That\u2019s right. ", " He\u2019s never changed his rhetoric. If you actually look at what Trump himself is saying.", " It\u2019s one of the very few things on which he\u2019s been absolutely consistent. Last summer, when Congress passed\u2014this completely broken Congress passed with a veto-proof majority a mandate for new Russia sanctions, and Trump made several public statements about it saying he doesn\u2019t like this bill; he doesn\u2019t want to do sanctions against Russia. ", "The Russian political media made so much hay of it! I mean, all Russian politicians up and down the power vertical, all of Russian TV, was crowing about how the president of the U.S. wants to be friends, but the deep state is hamstringing him, and is just pointlessly against Russia, just irrationally against Russia.", " Well, this leads to the bigger-frame question. If we agree, as it seems that we do, that Trump has never wavered in either his admiration for Putin or desire somehow to reset relations, even though politically that\u2019s become very unrealistic, where does that leave the two countries? There\u2019s been this long debate that actually predates Donald Trump, but has certainly flared up anew since the election, over whether or not we are in a state of essentially a new Cold War with Russia. And everybody has a point of view on it. ", "I\u2019ve written a long piece about it. My basic takeaway is that the terminology isn\u2019t all that helpful because the first Cold War was plenty bad, and it existed in a totally different both media and information and military context, where there could be clear dividing lines between Russia and the West in a way that the current world is no longer so neat.", "[INDISCERNIBLE 00:41:02]", "And there were kind of rules and protocols of what you do, especially by the latter phase of the Cold War.", " Well, that\u2019s right. But even if you don\u2019t like the terminology, as I know\u2014clearly, the situation between the two countries is as hostile, if not more so, than at any period since the late Cold War. Arguably, during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev, we were on much better terms as a country during the, say, the George H.W. Bush administration, even during the second Reagan administration. On much better terms with the Soviet Union than we are with Russia today. ", "So, how do you view that? I mean, how scared should we be by this level of hostility?", "Personally, I\u2019m very scared. And the one question I\u2019ll add to the outstanding questions is Donald Trump\u2019s motivations. You know, for this consistently laudatory rhetoric toward Russia and Putin, and I think we still don\u2019t know the answer to that. But about the\u2014", "Why are you very scared?", " The reason I\u2019m scared is because, like I said, I think in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just\u2014the way things were done. On the Soviet side and on the Russian side. Now, you have kind of flimsier systems in place. There are fewer rules. And you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful. Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent.", "And I worry that they\u2019re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage. I also worry that Putin\u2014you know, this isn\u2019t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs.", "And this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he\u2019s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist. And I worry that in this showdown Putin\u2019s going to outmaneuver Trump and the U.S.", " Well, you know, it\u2019s interesting. Before he was thrown out, H. R. McMasters authored a new National Security Strategy for the United States. And it\u2019s actually very similar to the new national defense strategy penned by Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense. And they lump Russia together with China and basically say the age of counterterrorism, post-9/11 obsession is over, and we have to return and renew a focus as a country on the challenges that count from great powers Russia and China, that we\u2019re in a new era of competition with Russia and China.", "And arguably, that\u2019s an era that began before Donald Trump; it\u2019s likely to continue after Trump has left office, whenever that is. And so what I\u2019m struck by is that Americans\u2014even if you put aside this question of Donald Trump\u2014they\u2019re not really prepared for that kind of a confrontation, and right now, of course, you don\u2019t really have a president who is leading or shaping that. Barack Obama didn\u2019t buy into that either, by the way. Many of his advisers did, but Barack Obama demeaned and belittled Russia and basically dismissed them as insignificant in the sweep of history, a finished and doomed former superpower. Maybe that\u2019s a bit of the problem. ", "Right. So, the issue is, do we really buy and accept this notion that, rather than America as the one superpower going forward, we have entered the post-American age, the age when we will struggle\u2014not that we won\u2019t be a power, but that when we will struggle and compete with other powers like China and Russia for dominance? ", " Well, this has been a thing that Vladimir Putin has been remarkably consistent about, and in 2007, when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference, he said that basically the liberal order that was established in 1991 at the end of the Cold War is over, and we don\u2019t agree to it, and we want to rediscuss and renegotiate the terms of surrender. ", "Yes, so now we\u2019re relitigating. ", "Yes, no more unipolar world, where America calls all the shots with no friction, because we\u2019ve seen\u2014I mean, this was happening in 2007, again, four years after the invasion of Iraq and six years after the invasion of Afghanistan. And one of which\u2014the invasion of Iraq\u2014Putin was firmly against, and at that point he had been kind of proven right. Things had spiraled out of control in Iraq. And he said, you know, that\u2019s it. No more\u2014you guys can\u2019t just go around doing whatever you want, especially you can\u2019t call the shots on who gets to rule which country.", "And I think that\u2019s what Syria\u2019s about; it\u2019s kind of drawing a line and saying, \u201cAmerica cannot say so-and-so must go. It\u2019s just not within their power. And we have something to say about that, too, and we will push back in a very real way.\u201d ", " So, welcome to the future\u2026", "He\u2019s achieved it, yes.", " We will compete with Russia and China for influence, authority, power and advantage, whether military or economic.", "I mean, and I think it\u2019s helpful to\u2014getting back to your very first question about the often ignorant way in which Russia is discussed in Washington\u2014I think it\u2019s not just about pride of intellect and expertise; it\u2019s about accurately diagnosing the problem and knowing what it is you\u2019re dealing with, right? You don\u2019t want to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy.", "And I think we have to understand that Russia is going to continue throwing sand in the gears, or weightier objects, and that they\u2019re going to be a force that is constantly going to push back\u2014often just to push back.

And I\u2019ll leave the final word, actually, to another friend of ours, Anne Applebaum, in a conversation that she and I had a few months ago on The Global Politico", "She said, Well, we actually have a clearer sense at this point in time of what Russia\u2019s intentions are than we do of what Washington and what Donald Trump is going to do about it. \u201cImagine if we were fighting the Cold War all over again, except only one side was fighting it.\u201d And I think that\u2019s an important question to leave us with.

Tom Cotton is preparing for battle against Sen. Rand Paul and the GOP\u2019s libertarian wing over the USA Patriot Act and the power of government to conduct spying operations domestically and abroad. ", " The 37-year-old Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, who vaulted to the Senate this year after a single term in the House, is maneuvering to build support for extending existing surveillance authority for the U.S. government \u2014 without the additional safeguards civil libertarians want. ", "Story Continued Below", " The Arkansas senator, who caused an international firestorm last month with his controversial letter to Iranian leaders, has spent many recent Fridays in Washington at FBI and National Security Agency headquarters, meeting with senior intelligence officials and administration lawyers to build his case for a clean extension of three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act. With the support of GOP leaders, he\u2019s serving as an emissary on the issue to GOP freshmen who are weighing whether to extend the controversial law. And he is seeking to sell his views on surveillance to Republicans from libertarian-minded states through classified briefings conducted by senior intelligence officials. ", " The emergence of Cotton, an unbending hawk celebrated by neoconservatives as a next-generation party leader on national defense, shows how intent Republican leaders are to prevail over the Paul wing of the GOP. Libertarian-leaning Republicans want to scale back \u2014 if not repeal \u2014 the Patriot Act before key provisions are set to expire May 31. ", " and ", " In an interview, Cotton warned that he\u2019s determined not to allow views like Paul\u2019s to take hold in today\u2019s Republican party. ", " \u201cAlmost every Republican elected last year believes that America is strong and safe when America is leading the world,\u201d Cotton said in an interview in his Senate office. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think many Republicans will want to see critical programs expire that will reopen intelligence gaps from the 1990s.\u201d ", " Cotton\u2019s move \u2014 which comes after 46 senators signed onto his open letter to Iran\u2019s senior leadership warning against making a nuclear deal with the United States \u2014 showcases how a younger crop of junior senators are exerting new influence within a body traditionally dominated by long-serving veterans. For Cotton, who doesn\u2019t even have a permanent office yet \u2014 he works in cramped basement quarters that lack a bathroom \u2014 the rise has been sudden. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinary display from a new senator,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cStarting with the 47-senator letter to the Ayatollah and now some pretty strong views on policy. The obvious question is how it goes over in his caucus: Are they going to make him the shadow secretary of state or the shadow secretary of defense?\u201d ", " The latest fight concerns three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who chairs the Select Committee on Intelligence, offered a bill this week that would extend the provisions for five-and-a-half years. The bill would cover the bulk collection of phone records under the Patriot Act\u2019s 215 program, which generated enormous controversy when it was revealed by leaker Edward Snowden. ", " The bill also would prolong two other measures : A so-called \u201clone wolf\u201d provision that allows the government to surveil potential terrorists who aren\u2019t directly connected to terrorist cells; and a section that allows the feds to use roving wiretaps to monitor suspects who rapidly change location or communication device. ", " \u201cHe\u2019s taking on the task to make sure all his class members are educated on what the issue is and why it\u2019s so important,\u201d Burr said, referring to Cotton\u2019s discussions with the 11 other Republicans and one Democratic senator who were first elected in 2014. \u201cAnd that\u2019s invaluable to the process; they are going to be educated, versus just shooting form the hip.\u201d ", " GOP leaders say they will push a straight extension of the law if no better alternative emerges. But the GOP House, which has a contingent of vocal libertarians, is pushing a plan that would limit most bulk data collections and impose other reforms. Moreover, a number of Democrats and some Republicans want further safeguards, including to shine light on telephone companies\u2019 participation in domestic surveillance and reform the secret court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. ", " President Barack Obama has endorsed changes to the Patriot Act intended to strengthen civil liberties, and top intelligence Democrats fret that Obama does not want to be jammed at the end of May with a bill that doesn\u2019t include privacy and transparency reforms. ", " \u201cThe president will have a problem with it,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). ", " Obama backed those policy changes late last year in a bipartisan bill known as the USA Freedom Act, but it was blocked by a stern McConnell whipping operation. That failed vote set the stage for the new GOP Senate. Republican leaders are hoping the arrival of hawkish Republicans like Cotton will help usher through an extension of the controversial law. ", " Yet several of the GOP\u2019s libertarian-leaning members said this week they\u2019ll oppose any Patriot Act legislation if it fails to address concerns that the government is sweeping up data about billions of phone calls as part of a program created to help root out terrorists. ", " \u201cI don\u2019t support anything in the Patriot Act,\u201d Paul, the Kentucky Republican and presidential candidate, said in an interview. \u201cI want to repeal the whole thing.\u201d ", " Cotton responded calmly. \u201cThis is just where Rand and I disagree,\u201d he said. Asked if he would support Paul if he won the Republican nomination, Cotton said, \u201c\u201cI\u2019m not getting involved in presidential politics right now.\u201d ", " The challenge for Cotton and Republican leaders is that a number of freshmen are well versed in the Patriot Act after having served in the House \u2014 and they\u2019ve backed safeguards in the past. ", " In May 2014, the House voted on an NSA reform bill that would have outlawed bulk data collection but was viewed as watered down by privacy advocates. That vote split the class of new GOP senators that came over from the House. James Lankford of Oklahoma, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Cotton voted for it \u2014 while Steve Daines of Montana and Cory Gardner of Colorado opposed it. The bill did not become law. ", " In an interview this week, Gardner said he wanted that bill to do more to protect civil liberties and wants to see an \u201cadequate balance\u201d now. ", " \u201cHe has been trying to answer any questions,\u201d Gardner said of Cotton. \u201cHe just sees himself as someone who can play a role in this.\u201d ", " Like Gardner, Daines hails from a libertarian-leaning state where passion over privacy rights runs high. And like Gardner, Daines remains skeptical about a straight extension, even as he\u2019s discussed the matter privately with Cotton. ", " \u201cI want to make sure we protect the privacy and the freedoms of the American people,\u201d Daines said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ensure that this is a very, very high priority as we look at the Patriot Act going forward.\u201d ", " But Cotton said the Obama administration has already taken a range of safeguards in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. He said there is no need to codify them into law because the intelligence community already addresses privacy concerns administratively and adheres closely to limits imposed by the White House. ", " \u201cThat\u2019s unneeded, and it also ties the hands of not only the commander-in-chief but also the intelligence professionals,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cWhy would you codify a set of safeguards you might want to change as technology evolves and you face new risks of privacy, in addition to changing safeguards that might need to be relaxed in an emergency situation?\u201d ", " Cotton became the youngest senator after trouncing incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor. A Harvard law school graduate, Cotton developed his hawkish views in combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and working at a unit servicing military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. ", " McConnell was the first person to encourage Cotton to run for the Senate last year. When he jumped in, he immediately cleared the GOP field as tea party groups united behind him due to his sharply conservative voting record in the House. ", " His demeanor is serious, a contrast to other back-slapping pols in the chummy Senate. A lanky 6-foot-5, Cotton walks briskly through the halls of the Capitol, rarely making time for chit chat. ", " When he learned he would be appointed to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January, Cotton moved quickly to deepen his understanding of U.S. surveillance programs, knowing he had to be prepared to stiffen his party\u2019s resolve with the provisions about to expire. ", " \u201cSometimes these things are driven by events,\u201d Cotton said, when asked if he expected to be at the center of major national security fights as soon as he became elected senator. ", " With his wife, Anna, expecting their first child any day, Cotton\u2019s travels back to Arkansas have been limited. That\u2019s given him extra time in Washington to build ties with the intelligence community. He has held more than a dozen conversations with senior administration officials, including NSA Director Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and Nick Rasmussen, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center. He has met with operatives responsible for the surveillance program at the NSA headquarters in Ft. Meade, Md., while also consulting with FBI agents to see how they implement their roving wiretap and lone-wolf authorities. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve met with every person from the directors of these agencies down to the newest [employees] who are executing the program, and they\u2019re all hardworking Americans who are doing a critical job, who understand the scrutiny they face and have tremendous degrees of safeguards on them,\u201d said Cotton, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ", " Cotton is helping to organize classified briefings between the 13-member freshmen class and special agents who run the programs to convince senators \u201cthere is absolutely no content collected in these programs, there\u2019s no personally identifiable information, there\u2019s no surveillance of telephone calls.\u201d ", " Yet some remain skeptical. ", " \u201cI do think there needs to be some sort of reforms,\u201d said Lankford, a freshman from Oklahoma who who also sits on the Intelligence Committee. ", " and ", " As Burr and McConnell were drafting their bill, Cotton had a good sense of where the leaders were moving with their proposal. By contrast, other more senior members were caught off guard. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s news to me and I\u2019m on the Intel Committee,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). \u201cI\u2019m surprised Chairman Burr didn\u2019t tell us. He apparently chose not to. I don\u2019t know what his plans are.\u201d ", " But if Cotton had his way, this would be the last debate Congress ever has on the matter. ", " \u201cI personally would like to see a permanent reauthorization \u2026 so we don\u2019t continue to have these debates and take up the time and resources and energy at agencies like the FBI and NSA every few years,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cBut I think a five-and-a-half year authorization is appropriate.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Bill Shuster approached fellow Republican Rep. Tom Graves with a request. The powerful Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman wanted to take over Graves\u2019 moribund Travel Transparency Act, an industry-friendly bill that would allow airlines to advertise the base price of a ticket without including fees and taxes. ", " The bill had gone nowhere under Graves (R-Ga.) \u2014 it didn\u2019t even muster a hearing in committee. Once the Pennsylvania congressman took over, though, it moved at lightning speed: He introduced a revised version of the bill in March of last year, the same day he met with an airline industry group that supported it. A month later, Shuster shepherded the measure through his transportation panel in roughly 10 minutes. It sailed through the full House three months later without a roll call vote. ", "Story Continued Below", " The legislation wasn\u2019t only a priority for Shuster: It was a top issue for Airlines for America, and for Shuster\u2019s girlfriend, Shelley Rubino, the organization\u2019s vice president and a top airline lobbyist. Shuster\u2019s panel oversees the airline industry, and Rubino\u2019s group spends millions of dollars lobbying Congress on behalf of major U.S. airlines. Rubino herself lobbied for the legislation, according to disclosure forms. ", " Shuster\u2019s relationship with Rubino was ", " last week by POLITICO, but at the time the legislation was going through the House, it was being kept secret. His relationship with her \u2014 and his dealings with her employer \u2014 have raised new questions about Shuster\u2019s advocacy on behalf of the airline industry. The ties go beyond Shuster and Rubino: The wife of Shuster\u2019s chief of staff is a top executive for Airlines for America, which is known as A4A. And the congressman recently hired an A4A lobbyist to run the committee\u2019s aviation panel. ", " Both Shuster and Rubino moved swiftly last spring to get the revised Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 across the finish line. The industry group worked with Shuster on tweaking the bill. Shuster and A4A used nearly identical graphics to promote the legislation. And Shuster\u2019s verbiage on the House floor was strikingly similar to A4A\u2019s talking points. ", " A year later, Graves says he has no idea why his bill was ignored before Shuster took it over. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that. I really don\u2019t.\u201d ", " \u201cI felt like as chairman, you know, if he\u2019d like to have his name on the front of it,\u201d that would be fine, Graves said in an interview. \u201cI think I was second co-sponsor.\u201d Graves added, \u201cI was the only one who had an interest at that time and then, I guess, some others gathered some interest.\u201d ", " A4A was unsuccessful in getting the measure through the Senate, and it\u2019s now seeking Shuster\u2019s help again. The trade association is trying to wedge the legislation into a massive overhaul of the Federal Aviation Administration pending before the transportation panel. Shuster is crafting that bill, and Rubino\u2019s group has a major stake in it. ", " Shuster said Rubino stopped lobbying him and his staff in July 2014. But prior to that, Rubino was the lead lobbyist on the Transparent Airfares Act and worked closely with Shuster, according to multiple people familiar with their relationship. She currently is permitted to lobby the other 50 lawmakers on Shuster\u2019s committee and their staff while she openly dates the chairman. ", " Both Shuster and A4A say that the relationship and their joint work on the ticket-pricing legislation were not improper and didn\u2019t cross any ethical lines. ", ", ", " and ", " Shuster, however, did not respond to questions about whether he should continue to oversee a massive industry for which his girlfriend lobbies. ", " \u201cThe chairman has a policy in place that goes above and beyond anything that is required, stating that Ms. Rubino does not lobby the chairman or his staff. There are no restrictions on whom a member of Congress can or cannot date,\u201d Casey Contres, a spokesman for Shuster, said in a statement. Contres added that several other interest groups, unions and airline companies also supported the legislation. ", " Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) office declined to comment on whether Shuster should recuse himself from aviation issues, whether the speaker has confidence in Shuster, or whether the Pennsylvania Republican should step down from the committee. ", " \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss Mr. Shuster\u2019s relationship with anyone,\u201d Boehner said at a news conference Thursday in response to a question. \u201cBut I\u2019m also very comfortable that the proper procedures were put in place to avoid a public professional conflict of interest.\u201d ", " Mike Long, spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), said in a statement that, \u201cit appears that Chairman Shuster has done what the House Ethics Committee would expect from any member in this situation. Beyond that, I won\u2019t comment on a private relationship.\u201d McCarthy oversees House chairmen. ", " Shuster, a Republican, and Rubino, a Democrat, are well-liked among their peers in Washington. Lawmakers \u2014 many of whom have aspects of their private lives they, too, would like to keep out of public view \u2014 have been wary of commenting publicly on Shuster\u2019s relationship with Rubino or his close alliance with the airline industry. Several House members privately shrugged their shoulders and said the relationship is simply emblematic of how Washington works. ", " The Pennsylvania Republican was on the House floor this week, glad-handing members of both parties. ", " The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Airlines for America used very similar graphics to support their push for the Transparent Airfares Act of 2014. The panel and A4A used a boarding pass to illustrate the 21 percent in federal government taxes that are included in airfare prices. They used the same passenger name \u2014 \"Smith, John\" \u2014 and the same $300 price for the ticket. The boarding time and ticket number were also identical. ", " A guide to the graphics: ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " Privately, though, many members have described the chairman\u2019s relationship with Rubino as unseemly and said they were surprised that committee members were being lobbied by his now-acknowledged girlfriend. ", " As the airfare legislation was gaining traction, Shuster\u2019s marriage was crumbling. Rebecca Shuster filed for divorce on July 2, 2014, according to court records filed in\u00a0Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. The Shusters\u2019 27-year marriage formally ended on Dec. 11.\u00a0 ", " At the same time Rebecca Shuster was filing divorce papers, Bill Shuster filed a document with his office stating that he was dating Rubino and that she would not lobby him or his staff. ", " It is unclear when the relationship between Shuster and Rubino actually began. The two have long been close. ", " Their legislative priorities have been closely aligned, too. Indeed, Shuster, Rubino and her employer made for a remarkably unified and effective team. ", " On April 9, 2014, Shuster steered the bill through his committee and secured a fast-track process on the House floor. Shuster never made leadership or members of his committee aware of his relationship with Rubino, who was also pushing for the bill on behalf of A4A, according to multiple sources. ", " A4A launched a lobbying offensive, meeting with staff and lawmakers and distributing an informational packet noting that the bill had bipartisan backing and arguing it would end \u201cthe government\u2019s ability to hide the ball on rising aviation taxes and fees.\u201d Consumer groups disputed that characterization, saying in fact the bill would reverse a government rule forcing airlines to disclose the full price of tickets on the front end, rather than informing customers of hefty fees and taxes just before they\u2019re asked to pay. ", " A4A also created a website last April \u2014 airfaretransparency.com \u2014 to push the bill. That website now urges lawmakers to include the legislation in the FAA reauthorization that Shuster is leading. ", " A4A spokeswoman Jean Medina denied Shuster and Rubino\u2019s personal relationship influenced the group\u2019s lobbying efforts or the bill\u2019s success in the House. ", " \u201cTo suggest legislation moved through because of a personal relationship is inaccurate and inappropriate,\u201d Medina said in a statement. She noted that the House considers a large number of bills on the suspension calendar, the accelerated process that was used to approve the airline bill. ", " Shuster and other lawmakers also met with A4A\u2019s board on March 6 to discuss the group\u2019s priorities, including the Department of Transportation\u2019s airfare regulations, Medina said. Shuster introduced his bill that same day. ", " Medina added that the group has also had, \u201crapid bipartisan consideration\u201d of other legislative priorities, including a cap on passenger security fees. ", " Still, Shuster worked so closely with the airline group on the ticket pricing bill that their talking points and graphics promoting the bill were nearly identical. ", " In his committee in March, and on the House floor in July, Shuster said: \u201cFor instance, right now, DOT requires an airline and travel agent to advertise a $237 plane ticket as costing $300, hiding the $63 of taxes and fees from consumers.\u201d ", " In an informational handout distributed to House staffers, A4A wrote: \u201cToday, on a typical $300 one-stop, domestic roundtrip ticket, airline customers pay a whopping $62 in federal taxes and fees, or 21 percent of the ticket price.\u201d ", " Nick Calio, the group\u2019s CEO, has also used that same rhetoric. ", " \u201cRight now\u2026 21 percent of every ticket goes to federal government in taxes and fees paid by airlines and their passengers,\u201d Calio said in a video posted to ", ". \u201cSo if you buy a $300 roundtrip ticket, that\u2019s $62 that goes to the government.\u201d ", " In the course of trying to pass the legislation, Shuster addressed criticism that he was attempting to solve a little-noticed problem. ", " \u201cThere are some folks that have complained, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 because nobody is complaining about it,\u201d Shuster said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s hidden, consumers don\u2019t know, so we\u2019re making sure that consumers know what the federal government is imposing on them in these taxes and fees.\u201d ", " Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation, said he supported the legislation because the federal rules on airline ticket pricing shroud government taxes and fees and are akin to a \u201creal nanny state bureaucracy.\u201d He said he was never lobbied to support this issue and had no comment on Shuster\u2019s personal life. ", " When Congress was considering the bill, consumer advocates argued it would instead allow airlines to hide the true cost of tickets up front. Charles Leocha, chairman of the consumer group Travelers United, said he was stonewalled when he asked the committee to delay the hearing on the bill last year. He called the bill \u201ca form of bait and switch advertising.\u201d ", " He is now calling for Shuster to step down as head of the powerful committee. ", " \u201cHaving the most powerful person in the House on transportation issues going out with someone who is working for the airline industry isn\u2019t right,\u201d Leocha said. \u201cThis shows such an incredible lack of integrity.\u201d ", " Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a friend of Shuster and former boss to Rubino \u2014 who worked on the Hill prior to A4A \u2014 bristled at questions over the lobbyist\u2019s relationship with Shuster. \u201cIs falling in love appropriate?\u201d he asked a POLITICO reporter. ", " Larson said he has spoken with Rubino and Shuster since their relationship was made public. Larson said he does not believe Shuster should have to recuse himself from aviation-related issues, but added the Pennsylvania Republican should consult legal counsel. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve known Shelley Rubino \u2014 she graduated from college and came to work for me when I was Senate president in the state of Connecticut,\u201d Larson added. \u201cShe\u2019s got more integrity in her baby finger than most people here collectively have all together.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

The document \u2014 which spelled out a comprehensive strategy that included military, diplomatic, humanitarian and communication efforts \u2014 argued that Syria and Iraq could not be treated as two separate theaters, and helped to sell the reluctant president on strikes in Syria, which began two weeks later.

Even as Obama dispatched another 1,500 troops to Iraq Friday, nearly doubling the existing force \u2014 and with a new senior general headed to the country soon, according to a Defense Department source \u2014 coalition allies and his own secretary of defense are warning that his war plan needs a rethink. ", " That problem has been compounded \u2014 according to interviews in recent days with more than a dozen current and former administration officials, experts and diplomats \u2014 by a lack of senior officials with deep expertise in Iraq and Syria and by a policymaking process hounded by rivalries and unclear leadership. Kerry\u2019s State Department has clashed with the Pentagon, Congress is complaining about not being consulted \u2013 and officials say there\u2019s no clear very senior owner of the war in the White House since the president finally made the call to embark on it.

But Biden\u2019s role has receded since the December 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. As a result, when ISIL rampaged through Iraq earlier this year, U.S. policy toward the country it occupied at the cost of so much blood and treasure just a decade ago was managed by a mid-level State Department official \u2014 former George W. Bush aide Brett McGurk, who had been called back into service by a shorthanded administration desperate for his detailed knowledge of Iraq\u2019s political dynamics.

", " Allen\u2019s naming added a new player with influence but not true authority and rankled turf-conscious Defense Department officials who didn\u2019t hide their annoyance that a senior general had joined the effort outside the military chain of command. Several people interviewed described a slow-moving process involving endless meetings and deliberation without action, along with basic uncertainty about who in the administration is really in charge. ", " Asked about this, a top administration official argued that any complex policy \u2013 never mind one that involves a multi-front war in two countries \u2013 includes many voices. \u201cAs with any issue you\u2019ll find multiple people who do multiple aspects,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find one who runs China.\u201d ", " Regardless of who\u2019s running it, few dispute that Obama\u2019s war against ISIL is off to a frustratingly slow start. After hundreds of U.S. airstrikes, the militant group still holds vast swaths of territory in both civil war-torn Syria and Iraq, including Iraq\u2019s second-largest city of Mosul. Dozens of American strikes have failed to rescue the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane along the Turkish border; a planned program to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIL has yet to commence; and members of Congress from both parties, along with foreign allies, complain that the campaign appears half-hearted and more about containing ISIL than truly destroying it, as the president has vowed. ", " ( ", ") ", " After weeks of such complaints, Obama\u2019s Friday announcement of the 1,500 additional troops to Iraq seemed to implicitly acknowledge the criticism and a weekend airstrike appears to have hit senior ISIL figures, possibly even the group\u2019s self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. (A Pentagon official could not confirm those reports on Sunday.) But some military planners continue to insist that defeating ISIL will eventually require placing thousands of American troops near the battlefront, in the form of Special Forces and forward air controllers who can designate highly accurate air strike targets. ", " \u201cThere are obviously differing views on the policy,\u201d a former senior U.S. commander said in an interview. \u201cShould there or not be joint tactical air controllers on the ground? Should there be special forces liaisons or forward adviser teams?\u201d ", " \u201cNo one\u2019s in charge of the policy. That\u2019s a really big problem,\u201d said one former U.S. government official with detailed knowledge of the ISIL fight.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently sent Obama his own memo asking what one Defense Department official calls \u201chard questions about the degree to which our strategy needs to change.\u201d In particular, Hagel urged more clarity on U.S. policy toward Assad. This followed remarks by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey publicly differing with the White House on whether U.S. ground troops might eventually be needed to defeat ISIL. ", " As Obama grasps for a winning policy, he is hamstrung by an expertise deficit on the two countries it now finds itself bombing. After U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011, the Obama team failed to maintain a deep roster of officials fluent in the country\u2019s complex sectarian and tribal relationships. In the past two years, meanwhile, Obama\u2019s two top Syria hands \u2014 Ambassador Robert Ford and State Department adviser Fred Hof \u2014 departed in frustration over what they have described as a hapless U.S. policy, taking their granular knowledge of the Syrian opposition with them.

", " But even his fellow conservatives aren\u2019t all jumping on board \u2013 a sign that the Republican repeal or bust movement is struggling while Obamacare continues to enroll millions of people with health insurance. ", "Story Continued Below", " While Cruz wants to use a draconian budget measure to repeal Obamacare with just 51 votes in the Senate, he looks to be increasingly out on a limb. Utah Republican Mike Lee, a leader in the conservative movement, isn\u2019t sold on the so-called budget reconciliation procedure to gut the law. Rand Paul says he\u2019s for repeal but is hedging on exactly how to do it. ", " Mitch McConnell, who may enjoy a 54 vote Senate Republican majority by January, won\u2019t commit to using the simple majority vote to kill Obamacare. And none of the Republican 2016 presidential candidates are pushing hard for the more radical Senate procedures to repeal the health care law. ", " Interviews with a wide range of key figures in the Senate and within the conservative movement show that while the party may be united rhetorically on repealing Obamacare, Republicans are surprisingly squishy on exactly how to do it. ", " The most popular response is to say, \u201cyes, I\u2019m for repeal,\u201d but without saying how. Paul spokesman Brian Darling says the Kentucky senator \u201cis committed one hundred percent to a full repeal,\u201d but added that \u201cusing regular order or reconciliation or both is an inside the beltway fight.\u201d And Steve Daines, the newly elected senator from Montana, said through a spokesman only that he \u201csupports fully repealing Obamacare\u201d and \u201cwill closely examine how to most effectively achieve that goal.\u201d ", " And that doesn\u2019t even address the moderates like Maine Republican Susan Collins, or politically vulnerable blue state Republicans who are up for re-election in 2016. Collins just got re-elected, and now her spokesman, Kevin Kelley, says Collins \u201cdoesn\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible to outright repeal the entire law\u201d and that Congress should spend its time just trying to fix its worst flaws. ", " The only sure thing for Republicans at this point is that there will be a vote on a standalone repeal bill, probably early in the year. And even though virtually all Republicans will vote for it, the bill will fall short of a filibuster-proof 60 in the Senate. ", " The real question is what happens after that. If the Republicans decide to declare all-out war, as Cruz wants, they could set up a simple majority vote on repeal under the budget reconciliation rules. The upside of this move is that it would get to Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 and he would veto it, which is exactly what many conservative activists want. The downside, however, is significant: Such a move would quickly dominate the Senate, divide Republicans and become a PR disaster. ", " The other option is just to focus on the most unpopular pieces of the law, like knocking out the individual mandate, the medical device tax, the definition of full-time work as 30-hours a week, and possibly a \u201crisk corridors\u201d provision that gives extra payments to health insurers that attract too many sick patients. ", " That\u2019s the approach McConnell and other Senate GOP leaders have talked about the most, and Republican aides say that strategy would have the advantage of attracting Democratic votes. ", " But Cruz is the most vocal member of a small group that believes any serious repeal attempt must use every possible legislative tool to put a bill on Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 not just the 60-vote strategy that they know will fail. Cruz, the architect of last year\u2019s government shutdown over Obamacare, ", " that \u201cI think we should start by using [budget] reconciliation to pass complete and total repeal.\u201d ", " Marco Rubio, another potential 2016 presidential candidate, is one of the few leaving the door open to the budget reconciliation approach. He ", " last month that \u201cI think we need to do it any way we can to get it done.\u201d ", " Heritage Action\u2019s Dan Holler said the use of reconciliation \u201csignals a seriousness\u201d that the GOP would wipe the law off the books if they win the White House in 2016. At least one of the new GOP senators, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, is on board with that plan, at least in a rhetorical way. Rob Skjonsberg, who managed his campaign and is now the director of his transition team, says Rounds wants to \u201crepeal and replace as much of Obamacare as possible through the budget process.\u201d ", " But the skeptics seem to outnumber the Cruz camp at this point. Lee, a tea party favorite, wants to have \u201cas many bites at the apple as possible,\u201d according to an aide \u2014 but he also wants more information on how much of the health care law the Senate could actually repeal through budget rules. The process can only be used for legislation that has some impact on spending and revenues \u2014 which includes most of the biggest pieces of Obamacare, like the individual mandate and subsidies for health insurance, but not all of it.

", " \u201cIt made perfect sense to me,\u201d Gillespie said of the decision to spend precious last-minute time staging a Facebook posting in an exclusive post-election interview. ", " Just two years ago, Republican candidates, by all accounts, lagged behind Democrats in the use of social media and real-time data to reach undecided voters. For an uber-strategist and veteran of the George W. Bush and Mitt Romney campaigns like Gillespie, the lesson was clear: Get serious about data-driven campaigning. ", " Now, Gillespie is convinced that his shrewd use of information like the importance of Buffalo Wild Wings helped him come shockingly close to defeating one of the Democrats\u2019 top stars, Sen. Mark Warner. Despite election-eve polls showing him behind Warner by 7 points, Gillespie ended up within 16,700 votes \u2014 less than 1 percent \u2014 of Warner, and he insists that his underfunded campaign\u2019s digital savvy was a key reason why. ", " \u201cI\u2019m a believer in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we would be outspent and that the digital element of the campaign is a way to help mitigate being outspent.\u201d ", " In the end, Gillespie spent $5.9 million overall on his campaign, $500,000 of it \u2014 or 47 cents per vote \u2014 on digital targeting. Other Republicans in better-funded races went further: Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner each spent that much just in the last couple of weeks of their campaigns. They were following a clarion call from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to GOP candidates across the country: Close the digital gap with the Democrats as quickly as possible. ", " Interviews with more than two dozen GOP leaders and political strategists indicate that the Republican Party now believes that it did so, at least in these midterm elections. Gone, for the moment, are the images of Romney\u2019s vaunted Orca vote-targeting machine crashed on the floor of Boston\u2019s TD Garden, or of left-wing Silicon Valley techies congratulating themselves solely on Democratic victories.

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO ", " \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we closed the gap,\u201d Gillespie argued of his own near-miss. ", " Of course, it remains an open question whether the Republicans will stay on pace with the fast-moving Democrats in 2016, when many of the Obama alumni consider joining Team Hillary or other campaigns, national and local, with new innovations to match. ", " But the story of how the Republicans came to embrace technology is arguably one of the hidden keys to the party\u2019s success in the 2014 midterms. It didn\u2019t create the wave that elevated so many Republicans, but it may well have ensured that candidates like Gillespie were able to make the most of it. One challenge for the GOP\u2019s continued success, many strategists believe, will be whether the party\u2019s underfunded insurgents can learn from races, like Gillespie\u2019s, that used technology in a smart, cost-effective way. ", " Over the final two months of the campaign, POLITICO got an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Gillespie\u2019s state-of-the-art digital operation that helped him become this cycle\u2019s most striking almost-winner. From the start it was a fittingly obsessive focus for the operation of a campaign insider: Gillespie had been chairman of the Republican National Committee under Bush and watched the party\u2019s historic tech advantage slip away; now, himself a candidate, he pumped out thousands of social media posts, translated his campaign website into six different languages spoken across the state, targeted voters with hundreds of tailored online ads and mined the national party\u2019s real-time database to find and contact more than 1 million potential supporters through old-fashioned door knocks and phone calls. ", " It almost worked. ", " *** ", " As the RNC chairman during Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, Gillespie saw firsthand what microtargeting could accomplish by sending out different messages to different potential voters. ", " \u201cAt that point, buying time on the Golf Channel was seen as a big thing,\u201d he recalled, as if remembering one of Harry Truman\u2019s whistle stops. ", " Just 10 years later, campaigns like the one Gillespie just mounted for Senate have a rapidly proliferating array of sophisticated new methods for connecting with voters, from streaming video ads on Hulu and YouTube to reaching people on their smart phones, mobile apps and tablets. Add in Facebook, Twitter and other social media, and candidates now have the ability to bypass reporters and speak directly to voters. ", " For Gillespie, technology was primed to be a great equalizer as he entered the Senate race in January, with Warner having already banked $7 million. Polls from the get-go put the Republican down more than 20 points against his Democratic rival, a popular former governor. He was also running in a state where TV advertising can be inefficient at best \u2014 there are eight different markets, crossing borders like North Carolina, West Virginia and Tennessee, as well as the pricey Washington, D.C., market, where two-thirds of viewers aren\u2019t even in Virginia. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s asymmetrical warfare,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cWhen you know you\u2019re going to be outspent, you\u2019ve got to spend your money more efficiently, more targeted, and social media enables you to do that.\u201d ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    Updated ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "\n                                ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

Rubino, a former top House Democratic leadership aide, has been with the trade group since March 2012. \n ", " ", " The two are often seen together at fundraisers and D.C. events, where Shuster is a sought-after figure. They also have been spotted together in Washington when Congress is not in session. \n ", " ", " \u201cMs. Rubino and I have a private and personal relationship, and out of respect for her and my family, that is all I will say about that,\u201d the 54-year-old Shuster said in a statement. \n ", " ", " Shuster added that his office \u201chas in place a policy that deals with personal relationships that cover my staff and myself. This was created in consultation with legal counsel and goes further than is required by the law. Under that policy, Ms. Rubino doesn\u2019t lobby my office, including myself and my staff.\u201d \n ", " ", " When Shuster started dating Rubino, 49, in the summer of 2014, he drafted a formal document stating she would not lobby him or his staff, including committee staff. This does not prevent Rubino from lobbying the other 50 members of the committee, and their aides. \n ", " ", " An official with Airlines for America said the group has consulted outside counsel about Rubino\u2019s relationship with Shuster. A4A, as the group is known, also said Rubino does not lobby the eighth-term lawmaker directly. But the trade group did not respond when asked whether she lobbies other committee members. \n ", " ", " \u201cShe [Rubino] lobbies on varied issues affecting our members and their customers, including proposed airline regulations, tax issues and matters related to safety and security,\u201d said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for A4A. \n ", " ", " Shuster got divorced last year after more than two decades of marriage. \n ", " ", " Medina declined to comment on Shuster and Rubino\u2019s relationship.

A4A President and CEO Nick Calio has a longstanding relationship with Chairman Shuster, as he did with his father before him. As such, Mr. Calio is the chief person who lobbies Chairman Shuster on behalf of A4A and our members.\u201d \n ", " ", " Rubino, who made more than $400,000 in 2013, did not respond to a request for comment. \n ", " ", " Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) office also did not have an immediate comment on the propriety of Shuster\u2019s relationship with Rubino, which legal experts say would not appear to violate ethics laws. \n ", " ", " Shuster\u2019s father, Bud Shuster, resigned from Congress in January 2001 after allegedly accepting gifts from and giving preferential access to a former aide-turned-lobbyist. Bill Shuster won the seat after his father resigned. The elder Shuster denied wrongdoing at the time. \n ", " ", " It isn\u2019t the first time Bill Shuster\u2019s personal interactions with female lobbyists have been an issue. He was said to be among a half-dozen congressmen then-Minority Leader Boehner spoke to about partying with female lobbyists at a Capitol Hill townhouse, according to news reports in 2010. \n ", " ", " Shuster\u2019s coziness with A4A goes beyond his personal ties with Rubino. He recently hired Chris Brown, A4A\u2019s vice president for legislative and regulatory policy, to be staff director on the Transportation Committee\u2019s aviation subcommittee. That panel is playing a critical role in the FAA reauthorization. Shuster\u2019s personal office chief of staff, Eric Burgeson, is married to Christine Burgeson, senior vice president of government relations at A4A. \n ", " ", " A4A is a powerful industry lobbying group. Its members include Delta Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, FedEx, Atlas Air, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest, United, UPS and US Airways. It spent $6.8 million on lobbying in 2014, according to disclosure forms filed with the Senate. \n ", " ", " The group is led by Calio, who was the White House\u2019s legislative affairs director under President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Shuster and Calio are close personal friends, according to several sources. \n ", " ", " A4A and its employees have contributed more than $20,000 to Shuster\u2019s campaign committees, according to Federal Election Commission records. The group\u2019s political action committee donated $10,000 to Shuster during the 2014 election cycle, making him the only member to whom the group made the maximum contribution. Calio has given $6,700 personally to Shuster\u2019s campaign committees as well. \n ", " ", " A4A member companies and their employees have given hundreds of thousands more to Shuster throughout his career, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations. \n ", " ", " When the airline lobby hired Rubino from her job as chief of staff to Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), Shuster was quoted in the group\u2019s news release, heaping praise on her. \n ", " ", " \u201cI have worked with Shelley and Chairman Larson\u2019s office for the past few years and I have always found her to be hardworking, capable and bipartisan in her approach to issues,\u201d said Shuster in a March 2012 news release put out by the association at the time. \u201cI think Shelley will be a tremendous addition to the A4A team that Nick Calio is building.\u201d \n ", " ", " Rubino previously worked as director of government law and strategies at Brown Rudnick Berlack Israels in Hartford. She has long been involved in politics in the Nutmeg State, serving as a top aide to the former statehouse speaker. \n ", " ", " Shuster has been closely aligned with A4A\u2019s legislative priorities. As of the end of 2014, A4A was lobbying on the Transparent Airfares Act of 2014, legislation that Shuster personally introduced. The bill, which passed the House in July 2014 but has not become law, would roll back the Department of Transportation requirement that airlines advertise the cost of taxes and fees. \n ", " ", " Shuster and A4A have also described how the airline industry is taxed in similar fashions. Shuster has ", " commercial airlines \u201cthe most regulated deregulated industry in America\u201d and said it is targeted for taxes and fees much the way alcohol and tobacco are. \n ", " ", " In a news release Wednesday, A4A ", ": \u201cIn fact, air travel is taxed at much higher rates than other modes of transportation. Aviation\u2019s federal tax rate is higher than that of alcohol or tobacco \u2014 products taxed to discourage their use.\u201d \n ", " ", " Medina, the group\u2019s spokesman, acknowledged the organization often borrows Shuster\u2019s rhetoric. \n ", " ", " \u201cAs head of the T&I committee, Chairman Shuster shares A4A\u2019s (and many other organizations\u2019) views on how to improve travel and infrastructure without further harming airline customers who already are overburdened by taxes,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn many cases, it is A4A picking up his language. He has pushed for a transformational FAA reauthorization bill. We fully agree and use that language as well. Alignment on the issues and making travel better for airline customers and creating jobs drives the agreement; to suggest otherwise is inappropriate.\u201d \n ", " ", " House ethics rules do not prohibit Shuster from working on issues affecting A4A. Conflict-of-interest rules don\u2019t prohibit family members, including spouses, from lobbying lawmakers, although members are barred from taking action on an issue in which they have a direct financial stake. Other romantic relationships are not addressed in the House Ethics Manual. \n ", " ", " That manual states that members are permitted to vote on an issue unless they have \u201ca direct personal or pecuniary interest in the event of such question.?\u201d Shuster did not report holdings in any airline stocks in his most recent financial disclosure. \n ", " ", " Stan Brand, the former general counsel of the House and an ethics expert, said that as long as Rubino is a registered lobbyist \u2014 which she is \u2014 there is no apparent ethics violation by Shuster, even if he backed or advocated on behalf of legislation supported by her organization. \n ", " ", " \u201cAbsent some exchange of gifts or things that would otherwise be a problem under the rules, I don\u2019t think the mere fact of her relationship with [Shuster] trespasses any other rules, at least none that I know of,\u201d Brand said. \u201cThe rules don\u2019t automatically disqualify a spouse from being employed in a trade association that may have interests before the committee. \u2026 I don\u2019t think that, in and of itself, is a violation.\u201d \n ", " ", " Bud Shuster, Bill\u2019s father, was also a former chairman of the Transportation Committee. Following a long investigation, the Ethics Committee found Bud Shuster engaged in a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of allowing his former top aide Ann Eppard \u2014 a transportation lobbyist \u2014 to appear before him on behalf of her clients after she left his staff. The CBS show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d filmed the elder Shuster hiding from TV cameras in the back seat of Eppard\u2019s car in an attempt to conceal his relationship with her. \n ", " ", " Bud Shuster denied wrongdoing in his dealings with Eppard, but he resigned after the Ethics Committee released its report on him. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Clinton\u2019s history of surrounding herself with people she\u2019s had long relationships with, and the balance of potential continuity with the Obama administration versus the need to chart her own direction are additional factors.Then there are more abstract but equally important considerations, such as, perhaps, wanting to appoint the first openly LGBT Cabinet secretary and other diversity considerations.", "Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s rundown of some of the most prominent chatter, based on conversations with top Democrats, people who speak regularly to Clinton and her senior aides, as well as leaders in their respective fields.", "Most people see this as a choice between Cheryl Mills, Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, and Tom Nides, Clinton\u2019s deputy secretary of state for management. Both have remained close to Clinton, with Mills acting as part of the extremely small inner circle on the running mate decision, and Nides as one of the closest outside advisers.

He\u2019d come at the job with that experience in Agriculture and in Washington, his political experience as governor of Iowa, and perhaps most importantly, his deep relationship with the Clintons.

The Elizabeth Warren-Bernie Sanders axis is watching this appointment for proof of Clinton\u2019s commitment to the progressive economics she\u2019s been talking up on the campaign, while business leaders and Republicans are worried about exactly that. The sense among people in the know is that Clinton would want someone with some private sector though not Wall Street experience, to have the competing perspective on regulation.

He\u2019d be a prominent carryover from the Obama administration, where he was credited internally for helping push forward on executive action while also keeping good relationships with the Hill. In an important prerequisite for this job, he has developed a trust and rapport with Clinton, which had a lot to do with his unexpectedly strong showing in the veepstakes.

Insiders are at a loss to think of an obvious candidate to do it, though. There\u2019s some speculation that former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, who oversaw one of the most successful state implementations in a reliably Republican state, could be a possibility, though some around Clinton suggest that this might be a good spot to lean more toward an inside player than a familiar face. That has some conversations tilting toward Tanden, a key player on Obamacare during its development and passage.", "Moving further down the list of prominent Cabinet spots, fewer specific names are being discussed \u2014 and the conversations tilt even further into speculation \u2014 but two of the names that have been floated: former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, who was considered for this position under Obama and just headed a successful convention effort for his party, and Federal Aviation Administration head Michael Huerta.", " ", " Nutter\u2019s also discussed as a possibility here, because Clinton and her aides are thought to be interested in emphasizing cities and drawing on urban experience. That\u2019s also led to some conversations about former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who came into politics as a housing advocate, has represented several public housing developments in office, and has been working with the campaign.", " ", "Granholm is seen as a fit here, too: Like Perez under Obama, she\u2019d be someone with reliable liberal credentials who could help both in developing policy and as a surrogate and a salve to the left. Some on the Hill are already pining for Ed Montgomery, a deputy Labor secretary under Clinton and a member of Obama\u2019s auto task force.", " ", "\n                    ", "\n                    By ", " John Hickenlooper is thought to be a consideration. Like Obama\u2019s first Interior secretary, Ken Salazar, he comes from Colorado and did well enough in the vetting for running mate that he got an interview with Clinton. His history on fracking, though, may be a killer with environmental groups.", " ", " Though obviously one of the more important jobs in the administration, the idea of who would fill it stumps people. The most common name brought up here is Martin O\u2019Malley, who has experience that could fit into the position, but most expect that his aggressive attacks on Clinton during his presidential campaign that never got off the ground, coupled with his refusal to endorse her for months, has sunk him in Clintonworld.", " ", " Most people paying attention haven\u2019t gotten anywhere near this far down the list of possible Cabinet picks. Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow is mentioned, but without any sense so far of serious consideration.", "If Rep. Tammy Duckworth doesn\u2019t win the Illinois Senate seat that she\u2019s favored to take from Mark Kirk, she could be in discussion again. She is, after all, a former VA assistant secretary who was talked about as a possibility after Eric Shinseki resigned. The depth of bureaucratic disaster that Bob McDonald\u2019s been digging out from might make this a position where Clinton could opt for continuity, and he hasn\u2019t been on the job long. But Sloan Gibson, the current deputy secretary and a former USO CEO who served as interim secretary between Shinseki and McDonald, might make a reasonable bridge himself. There\u2019s also the chance that Clinton might opt for someone recently out of uniform (as Shinseki was) though with all that\u2019s come to light about the problems in the agency, there\u2019d probably be more emphasis on specific departmental management in making the pick than there was when Obama went in that direction.", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), his wife, Heidi, and their daughters Catherine (left), 4, and Caroline, 6, wave to the audience at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., after Cruz announced his candidacy for president of the United States.\r\n", "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2014 Ted Cruz, proclaiming himself a steadfast conservative who would undo much of President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda and stand for Christian ideals, launched his presidential campaign here Monday, becoming the first official candidate of the 2016 presidential election. ", " Speaking at Liberty University, the world\u2019s largest Christian school, Cruz, a first-term Texas Republican senator, used his 25-minute speech to hammer Obama and offered an implicit criticism of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has emerged as the establishment front-runner in the 2016 contest for the GOP nomination. ", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cImagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine in 2017, a president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare.\u201d ", " Referring to the educational standards backed by Bush, the Texas senator said: \u201cImagine repealing every word of Common Core.\u201d In another swipe at Bush, who has supported comprehensive immigration reform, Cruz promised to oppose \u201cunconstitutional executive amnesty.\u201d ", " Cruz, who rose to national prominence riding a tea party wave, has carefully cultivated an image as an outsider and an uncompromising conservative. He drew widespread attention for helping to orchestrate the anti-Obamacare strategy that led to the 2013 government shutdown, an act that firmly established him as a hero to the conservative grass roots but also made him a polarizing figure on both the left and the right. ", " In announcing his candidacy, the 44-year-old Cruz sought to get out ahead of other candidates, several of whom \u2014 including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 are expected to get into the contest early next month. In doing so, Cruz circumvented the traditional exploratory phase of a presidential campaign, choosing instead to jump headfirst into the race. ", " Coloring Cruz\u2019s calculation, his advisers said, was the belief that he had little to gain by waiting. In recent months, his star has been eclipsed by other candidates-in-waiting, notably Bush, who since launching his exploratory campaign has locked up the backing of much of the Republican Party\u2019s establishment wing. At the same time, Cruz has been facing growing competition for conservative support from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. ", " With the next campaign launch not likely to come until April 7 \u2014 when Paul kicks off his presidential bid in Louisville \u2014 Cruz will have a two-week period to draw attention to his candidacy. Later this month, he will travel to New Hampshire, a critical early primary state. ", " The window will also enable Cruz to fill his coffers, with the early launch positioning him to take full advantage of the second fundraising quarter to amass cash in advance of the June 30 filing deadline, when a well-stocked campaign treasury will be viewed as a sign of strength. Later this week, he will head to New York City to raise money. ", " The date and venue of Cruz\u2019s announcement were rich with political significance. March 23 marked the five-year anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, of which Cruz has been an outspoken opponent during his brief senatorial career. ", " In choosing to stage his announcement at Liberty University, a Baptist school founded in 1971 by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, Cruz, a Baptist, signaled that he will cast himself as a principled social conservative and align himself with the evangelical voters who play a critical role in the early primary states. He marbled his speech with references to God and told the story of his father, who left the family home when Cruz was 3 years old but later returned, having found redemption through Jesus. ", " \u201cThere are people who wonder if faith is real,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI can tell you, in my family there is not a second of doubt because were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ I would have been saved and I would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household.\u201d ", " \u201cI believe God isn\u2019t done with America yet,\u201d he said later. ", " The forum also allowed Cruz, a former Texas solicitor general who has argued nine times before the U.S. Supreme Court, to highlight his oratorical skills by walking around the stage to deliver his address. Cruz, as he often does in speeches, paced back and forth as he spoke, covering ground ranging from his personal upbringing to economic and international affairs. He offered red meat for his conservative audience but also sounded an uplifting note about returning the nation to greatness. ", " \u201cIt was a good speech. He hit all the right points,\u201d said Dave Carney, a longtime Republican strategist who guided Rick Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. \u201cMost candidates couldn\u2019t put together that effort without years of experience.\u201d ", " There\u2019s also the name of the school \u2014 \u201cLiberty\u201d \u2014 which allowed Cruz to position himself as a tea party figure. And, for Cruz, an underdog in a crowded field of Republican hopefuls, the school\u2019s location had historical meaning: Lynchburg was the site of a June 1864 Civil War battle that saw Confederate forces beat back an imposing Union army. ", " There are potential risks to his early launch. The heavy attention on Cruz is likely to expose him to attacks from rivals, some of whom already haven\u2019t shied away from criticizing him. Likely candidates such as Rick Santorum, Perry and Lindsey Graham have all publicly jabbed him in the past, even before he was officially running. ", " Advisers to several candidates scoffed at Cruz\u2019s choice of venue, pointing out that he wasn\u2019t holding his speech in front of supporters or in his home state, but rather at an event where student attendance was mandatory \u2014 giving him a captive audience. ", " The hours leading up to Cruz\u2019s speech were filled with campaign theatrics. On Sunday, the senator\u2019s political team allowed an Associated Press photographer to tour the stage with Cruz at the school\u2019s Vines Center. One shot captured the candidate and his wife, Heidi, kissing. ", " At midnight, Cruz sent out a tweet declaring himself a candidate. \u201cI\u2019m running for President and I hope to earn your support!\u201d he wrote. Cruz also released a slickly produced Web video in which he declared, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again, and I\u2019m ready to stand with you to help lead the fight.\u201d ", " The planning for the event reflected a sense of urgency from Cruz\u2019s team. Liberty\u2019s school newspaper reported Sunday that Jerry Falwell Jr., the university\u2019s president, first received a call from the senator\u2019s advisers last week to inquire about speaking at the convocation. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who is close to Bill and Hillary Clinton, was initially scheduled to speak on Monday, the report said, and he declined the offer to share a stage with Cruz or remain the only speaker and push Cruz\u2019s event to the afternoon. ", " Cruz\u2019s political rise has been meteoric. From 2003 to 2008, Cruz, a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, served as Texas\u2019 solicitor general. Before that, he was an official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration. In 2012, he ran for Texas\u2019 open Senate seat, aligning himself with the ascendant tea party and crushing Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the better-funded pick of the establishment. ", " Ted Cruz: I am running for the President ", "\n  ", " ", " During his short tenure in the Senate, he cut a reputation as a steadfast conservative and a political maverick willing to take an obstructionist position, even at the expense of alienating his Senate colleagues and the GOP establishment. His role in the government shutdown \u2014 he famously staged a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor \u2014 angered many in his own party, who saw the move as politically reckless. ", " Cruz\u2019s advisers believe he can establish himself as the favorite of conservatives and evangelicals and then emerge as an alternative to an establishment front-runner, perhaps Bush. To get there, Cruz\u2019s team has said it plans to raise $40 million to $50 million. ", " As Cruz prepared to take the stage Monday, his advisers said they were mapping out a campaign that would surprise much of the establishment class. ", " \u201cWe have some exciting things planned with this campaign,\u201d said one aide, \u201cand we\u2019re going to do things on this campaign that don\u2019t follow the traditional \u2018D.C. way\u2019 of doing them.\u201d ", " Even so, some party strategists stressed that how far Cruz goes in the primary is more likely to hinge on his success in presenting himself to early-state voters \u2014 something he is just beginning to do. ", " \u201cIt was an impressive entry into the race,\u201d said Matt Strawn, a former Iowa Republican Party chairman. \u201cBut it\u2019s his performance offstage, at Pizza Ranches [a popular Iowa restaurant chain], that will determine how he fares in Iowa.\u201d ", " PHOTO GALLERY: Ted Cruz kicks off 2016 campaign ", "\n  ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

And I think, for the first time, in the Romney campaign, people like me were able to raise a tremendous amount of money from the Orthodox community because of that closeness of the mind-set on issues like Israel, and Israel\u2019s safety and security.\u201d \n ", " ", " Less than 24 hours after announcing his candidacy last month, Cruz hit his Week One fundraising goal of $1 million, in large part from money raised at a New York City event that included a \u201csizable\u201d Orthodox contingency, according to a source. (The host of the event, Rebekah Mercer, is not Jewish.

Asked about the political utility of engaging such a small group, Cruz pointed to fundraising and also nodded to states like Florida and Ohio, which have historically been general election swing states and have sizable Jewish populations. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe Jewish community has always played an important role in the political process, both as swing voters in a number of swing states, and also as key donors and financial supporters,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey take seriously the stakes that are posed, the gravity of the threats.\u201d \n ", " ", " In the past several weeks alone, Cruz has met with an influential Orthodox rabbi from New York, hosted an event with Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to highlight the dangers of a nuclear Iran, and made an appearance at a swanky Passover gathering in California that drew wealthy Orthodox Jews. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe Orthodox segment is more open to supporting Republicans, and some individuals in the Orthodox community are active in political fundraising contributions,\u201d said Nathan Diament, head of the Orthodox Union, who said Cruz has been the most \u201cproactive\u201d of the 2016 contenders in engaging Orthodox Jews. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll see more activity on the Republican side, reaching out to the Orthodox community, than you\u2019ll see more broadly [in engaging the rest of the Jewish community].\u201d \n ", " ", " Over the past year, Cruz has also showed up at Sabbath services at swanky synagogues in the Hamptons; in Bal Harbor, Florida.; and in Beverly Hills, California. His deputy chief of staff, Nick Muzin, will often spend the weekend with the community, and Cruz will pop in for a Saturday morning sermon. Muzin, who is playing several roles on Cruz\u2019s campaign, including serving as a senior adviser, has shepherded many of the senator\u2019s connections to the Orthodox world, according to about a half-dozen Jewish leaders. \n ", " ", " Muzin\u2019s longtime relationships with leaders in the Orthodox community help explain Cruz\u2019s focus on that segment of the Jewish donor class. For example, Howard Jonas, CEO of Genie Energy , has had Cruz over for Sabbath dinner and said he and his friends have supported him in the past and expect to contribute again. That invitation came because Jonas is friends with Muzin. \n ", " ", " Cruz is one of the two most active 2016 contenders in reaching out to the Jewish community as a whole, even beyond the Orthodox community, said one currently unaligned Republican fundraiser who works with Jewish donors. The other is Rand Paul, said the source, noting that the libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator has sought to reassure hawkish donors that he is sufficiently pro-Israel. But other more establishment-friendly Republicans, like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, are considered likely to do better in the broader Jewish GOP donor world, which tends to support more moderate Republicans. \n ", " ", " He doesn\u2019t necessarily have a lock on the Orthodox Jewish donor class yet, either. Rich Roberts is something of a kingmaker among ultra-Orthodox Jews in Lakewood, New Jersey, who frequently hosts politicians at his home, including Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul and connects them to leaders in that deeply religious community. But he hadn\u2019t yet made time to meet with Cruz, beyond a brief session in a hotel suite in Florida about a year ago, despite urging from the Texan\u2019s camp. Roberts, who likes Walker, said in an interview that \u201cthis round might not be [Cruz\u2019s] round to run.\u201d \n ", " ", " But in many corners of the Orthodox community Cruz is a \u201cfolk hero,\u201d said Jeff Ballabon, an Orthodox Republican operative. He assumed that mantle last fall when the senator told a group of Middle Eastern Christians booing Israel that \u201cif you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you.\u201d \n ", " ", " \u201cAll of a sudden, that put him very much top-of-mind as a strong defender [of Israel], someone who felt in his gut about the Middle East the way the Orthodox community does,\u201d said Ballabon, the architect of George W. Bush\u2019s groundbreaking outreach to the Orthodox community, a group that Republicans previously had largely ignored. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think, \u2018I\u2019m going to be the candidate for the Orthodox Jews.\u2019 When that video went viral, all the Orthodox Jews were clamoring to meet him.\u201d \n ", " ", " Ballabon first met Cruz when the senator was running as an underdog in the 2012 Texas GOP primary. He attended a Sabbath dinner Ballabon organized at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and appeared comfortable staying at the religious event for hours. Ballabon said Cruz is \u201cclearly a person of great faith.\u201d \n ", " ", " At CPAC this year, some of Cruz\u2019s most ardent supporters were yarmulke-wearing yeshiva students, several of whom said in interviews at the time that they were so impressed with Cruz\u2019s support for Israel that they didn\u2019t much care whether he could win the GOP primary \u2014 they would be supporting him anyway. \n ", " ", " For Cruz, who attended an elementary school in Houston that was about half Jewish \u2014 he grew up wishing his family would celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas \u2014 the interest in Israel began in 1976, he said, as a very young Cruz learned of the Entebbe raid, an Israeli military operation to save airline passengers held hostage in an airport terminal in Uganda. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s brother Yoni was killed leading that raid. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt struck me as a profoundly Texan approach to an act of terrorism,\u201d said Cruz, who is an admirer of the hawkish prime minister. That tough response appeared to stem from \u201ca foreign policy approach driven from strength, which I often wish American foreign policy more closely resembled.\u201d \n ", " ", " The senator also suggested he connects well with Jews because for his family, America was a safe haven from oppression in Cuba, just as it has been for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe and elsewhere. \n ", " ", " Last fall, Cruz deeply impressed Mort Klein, the head of the hawkish Zionist Organization of America, during a 45-minute conversation about Israel. Klein decided to invite Cruz to a November ZOA dinner, which drew major Jewish donors, including some who are Orthodox. \n ", " ", " \u201cIn coming to our dinner, seeing the response [from] people at the dinner, and the very wealthy Jewish activists at the dinner, I think this made him understand, \u2018My God, Jews understand my position on Israel, even though I\u2019m a Republican and most Jews are not, maybe they will be interested in considering being supportive of me,\u2019\u201d Klein said. \n ", " ", " That\u2019s a premise Cruz has been exploring so much that Tevi Troy, a former Bush administration official and another friend of Muzin\u2019s, relayed a joke making the rounds: \u201cI\u2019ve heard Cruz is also available for brises and bar mitzvahs, because he\u2019s been so active and eager.\u201d \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " \u201cThere\u2019s a base of progressives out there nationally looking for a voice, and they\u2019ve been funding people for a while,\u201d says O\u2019Malley senior adviser Bill Hyers, who managed liberal darling Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York mayoral campaign in 2013. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a group we can tap into that is looking for Gov. O\u2019Malley.\u201d ", " But as O\u2019Malley seeks to sharpen the contrast with Clinton, aides said, he is unlikely to lash out at her directly anytime soon.

", " While the O\u2019Malley brain trust is invested in raising the likely candidate\u2019s name recognition levels in the early-voting states, his advisers see no benefit in doing so by attacking Clinton, whose campaign looks and feels like a juggernaut. It\u2019s not productive for O\u2019Malley to become known for anti-Clinton attacks, they believe, preferring that he focus on specific issues \u2014 like strengthening Wall Street regulation and opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal \u2014 that excite liberals. ", " Ultimately, his strategists hope to position him as a liberal with executive experience, funded largely by a robust online donation operation. ", " Not that they mind when he catches the attention of the national news media by subtly knocking the former secretary of state, as he did Wednesday with a fundraising email about the trade deal carrying the subject line \u201cHard choice?\u201d \u2014 an obvious reference to Clinton\u2019s 2014 memoir, \u201cHard Choices.\u201d ", " and ", " But O\u2019Malley, who has consistently hovered around 1 percent in national polls of Democrats considering their options for the White House in 2016, has no specific plans to go much further for now, in what are likely the final weeks of his pre-campaign. ", " \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be sustainable to have a ping-pong match going back and forth, especially in the early states. What you want to do is get known for issues,\u201d says Trevor Cornwell, a Silicon Valley executive and former campaign operative who is helping O\u2019Malley raise money and is hosting a series of meetings for him with venture capitalists and tech figures in California this week. ", " But on top of his polling and name recognition deficit, O\u2019Malley faces a major uphill financial climb against the Clinton machine, which is looking to raise over $2 billion between its campaign and super PACs by November 2016, backed by a who\u2019s who of major Democratic donors. O\u2019Malley has a handful of allies prepared to fund his efforts and to raise money for him \u2014 including Washington attorney John Coale and Terry Lierman, the former Maryland Democratic Party chairman who served as a national finance chairman for Howard Dean in 2004 \u2014 but O\u2019Malley\u2019s team expects his focus on online fundraising to be \u201ctremendous,\u201d in the words of Hyers. ", " \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of candidates take a lot of money because they catch fire at the right time, and that has to be part of the strategy,\u201d he said, pointing to O\u2019Malley\u2019s liberal appeal on a handful of issues. ", " In a recent speech at Harvard University, where Warren taught until recently, O\u2019Malley cited his record of raising the minimum wage, bolstering collective bargaining and increasing education funding as governor. He also called for expanding Social Security and reforming the college loan system. ", " But his consistent hammering on staunchly liberal issues has not paid dividends in polling. His 1.5 percent support is far behind Clinton\u2019s 63 percent in the ", " through mid-April, but it also lags the 12 percent for Warren and 11 percent for Vice President Joe Biden, not to mention independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 5 percent and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb\u2019s 2 percent. O\u2019Malley backers assume he will pick up many of the voters who are currently aligned behind Warren and Biden, but a ", " of the Democratic field that didn\u2019t include Warren still showed O\u2019Malley at 1 percent earlier this week. ", " Still, Democrats across the party expect a non-Clinton candidate to catch fire over the summer and to garner 25 percent to 30 percent of the vote in Iowa, a state with which O\u2019Malley has been familiar since he spent time there on behalf of Gary Hart\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign. Clinton\u2019s camp expects O\u2019Malley to rise in the polls. ", " O\u2019Malley\u2019s team has been aggressive about following up with activists who speak with the former governor during his early-state trips, and he has been benefited from the state parties\u2019 financial and organizational interest in competitive primaries. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s a really straightforward grass-roots approach,\u201d says Dave Allen, a New Hampshire lawyer who hosted O\u2019Malley for a roundtable discussion last month. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as the only person who could make the primary relevant.\u201d ", " Nonetheless, even Democrats who see him as liberals\u2019 best hope against Clinton identify his likely fundraising deficit as a serious uphill battle, along with the fact that then-Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, the Democrat running to replace him in Annapolis, lost in November in what was widely viewed as a referendum on O\u2019Malley. And many see as a weakness the fact that he was one of Clinton\u2019s staunchest backers when she ran in 2008, supporting her against Obama until June of that year. ", " But Clinton\u2019s team has yet to directly engage with O\u2019Malley or any other potential challenger, despite their behind-the-scenes acknowledgment that he could cause some trouble down the road.

It was just a minor faux pas \u2014 while geographically accurate, South Carolinians refer to that area as \u201cthe Upstate\u201d \u2014 but it reminded everyone listening of Walker\u2019s lack of familiarity with the state.

", " From 1980 through 2008, the winner of the state\u2019s first-in-the-South primary went onto win the GOP nomination. But, in 2012, Newt Gingrich won a big upset over Mitt Romney here by running to his right. Walker\u2019s team knows that a split decision is likely in Iowa and New Hampshire, which means that the Palmetto State could have a crucial clarifying role in the nominating battle. ", " Walker plans to emphasize what he perceives to be areas of cultural common ground as he travels to places like Rock Hill, in the Charlotte suburbs, and Charleston, on the coast, Friday. ", " \u201cI love barbecue,\u201d Walker declared during an afternoon speech, employing a clich\u00e9 about the state. \u201cI met my wife at a barbecue place, so that\u2019s a good omen\u2026We went back to the barbecue place on the night of our wedding!\u201d ", " In a deeply evangelical state, Walker added extra emphasis on his faith to the standard stump speech. \u201cAs the son of a Baptist preacher,\u201d he said, \u201cI particularly appreciate your prayers.\u201d ", " In a place far more dependent on the military than Iowa or New Hampshire, he amped up his hawkish tone.

His last trip to the Palmetto State was for a 2013 rally kicking off Haley\u2019s reelection campaign, where he appeared with a handful of other governors now competing for the GOP nomination.

Haley appeared at a press conference earlier this week with Jeb Bush, who also made his first visit to the state this year.

", " Walker opened his speech with an ode to the power of prayer, positing that it matters more to campaign than how much money gets raised. When Congressman Paul Ryan, a fellow Badger, became the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012, Walker called him with advice: the governor said that Ryan should be ready when supporters on the campaign trail say that they are praying for him.

", " South Carolina\u2019s primary dynamics this year have been upended by the presence of the state\u2019s senior senator, Lindsey Graham, who is staffing up and seriously exploring a run for president. Graham\u2019s primary focus is on national security \u2014 an issue area far from Walker\u2019s comfort zone. ", " While not mentioning Graham, Walker took a very hardline when discussing the Middle East. He attacked President Barack Obama for drawing a red line and not following through when Syria crossed it. He slammed Hillary Clinton for pursuing a \u201creset\u201d with Russia as Secretary of State. ", " In the conservative Christian stronghold of Greenville, Walker got another standing ovation from a crowd of 175 when he declared his support for Israel. \u201cWe need a commander-in-chief that will recognize once and for all that Israel is our ally and will start acting like one,\u201d he said. Many evangelicals believe that God gave that land to the Jewish people. ", " Walker\u2019s war against organized labor, which catapulted him into the national consciousness, has special resonance in the Palmetto State. Local leaders have vigorously battled the federal government and the National Labor Relations Board during the Obama era to limit union power. They aggressively encourage businesses like Boeing to move jobs from states with a more pro-labor environment.

Unions are not powerful here, and Walker joked about how few showed up \u2013 compared to the 100,000 who stormed his state capitol in Madison four years ago this month.

Hatch, Wyden and Ryan did not release details of the TAA deal. However, the bill is expected to move separately from TPA so Republicans can vote against it.

Dan Kildee, just back from a trip to Asia with other congressional Democrats, said he doubted the agreement would really require Japan to open its market to more U.S. auto imports or Vietnam to raise labor standards, despite White House assurances on those fronts.

In what seemed to be a last attempt at stopping the Iran bill, he was telling Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee not to worry about Obama\u2019s veto \u2014 as long as they got the changes that were being discussed, they could go ahead and vote for the bill. \n ", " ", " But Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that the White House\u2019s last-minute lobbying suggests it was very concerned about any bill, up until a final committee vote. Secretary of State John Kerry argued against the measure in its original form in a classified briefing with senators just before the Foreign Relations Committee convened and unanimously approved it, though he was careful not to threaten an Obama veto. \n ", " ", " \u201cI would not minimize anything that happened,\u201d Corker said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWhy did they oppose it so strongly if it\u2019s such a minimal thing?\u201d \n ", " ", " What Kerry was doing in individual calls with members, according to sources familiar with the conversations, was laying the groundwork: The bill as originally proposed was not acceptable, but if lawmakers were to make the changes the White House wanted, it would be a different story. \n ", " ", " Senate Democrats aren\u2019t disagreeing that the White House came out ahead. \n ", " ", " As Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) put it, if a deal can\u2019t keep one-third of the Senate on board, \u201cthen it\u2019s really a bad agreement.\u201d \n ", " ", " Still the legislation carries risks for the president and requires the administration to keep Congress closely informed as negotiations continue \u2014 and for years afterward. \n ", " ", " The bill requires quarterly reports from the administration to Congress on Iran\u2019s adherence to the deal. If Obama isn\u2019t able to certify that Iran is complying, Congress could quickly vote to tighten sanctions. The next president could also re-evaluate whether Iran is complying and come to the opposite conclusion of Obama, potentially reversing the deal. \n ", " ", " The Corker proposal will also inject uncertainty into the White House efforts to complete an agreement. It\u2019s hard to imagine dozens of Democrats in both chambers voting against the deal as presented by Obama earlier this month, but the fragile framework is being portrayed in different ways by the United States and Iran. \n ", " ", " Just as with the public fit that Obama and his aides threw over the letter that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent with 46 other Republican senators \u2014 the legislative machinations were more for domestic political purposes than to reassure Iran \u2014 the administration believes that Tehran and the other international partners recognize that the White House would have to find some way to keep Congress at bay. \n ", " ", " \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t discuss the specifics of our congressional conversations with other countries, but we did convey to them throughout this process that we were committed to implementing an agreement if we can get to one, and that we would keep working with Congress to see how we could make this all work,\u201d said a senior administration official. \n ", " ", " Democratic leaders aren\u2019t operating under the assumption that the president\u2019s deal will automatically be safe if and when a final deal is complete. \n ", " ", " \u201cKeep in mind that the War Powers Resolution was passed over the veto of President Nixon. There comes a moment when the Congress asserts itself,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). Asked whether he could envision a scenario in which Democrats override Obama\u2019s veto of a resolution of disapproval: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d \n ", " ", " One potential rift flagged by lawmakers, though, would be if Iran calls for immediately lifting congressional sanctions. On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani emphasized on Twitter that if sanctions don\u2019t end immediately, there won\u2019t be a deal. But the Obama administration insists it would lift sanctions only in phases. \n ", " ", " and ", " Congress might override a veto \u201cif the deal is inadequate. For example if it had a provision that said all the sanctions went away on Day One,\u201d said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president would take that deal. But if that was in the deal, I don\u2019t think Congress would go along with it.\u201d \n ", " ", " Still, Democrats struggled to think of a deal that would prompt two-thirds of Congress to oppose it. \n ", " ", " Republicans had hoped to make it easier to block an agreement with Iran by classifying it as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote of the Senate to ratify. But Democrats never would have come on board with anything that made congressional approval a requirement, which meant Corker had to hammer in the reality to his colleagues: This bill was the best they were going to get. \n ", " ", " \u201cI would have preferred that it require congressional approval. But I think this is some progress. It\u2019s something we could work with,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \n ", " ", " Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called the compromise \u201cshort of the ideal\u201d but \u201cacceptable.\u201d \n ", " ", " Democrats and Republicans who\u2019ve long pushed Corker\u2019s bill say that functionally it\u2019s no different than in February, when it was introduced and promptly met by a veto threat. But the White House says it won important concessions from Republicans, including the softening of a requirement that the U.S. certify that Iran is not sponsoring terrorism. The period for congressional review was also shortened. \n ", " ", " But the guts of the proposal remain in place, including the ability for Congress to block the lifting of sanctions. \n ", " ", " Though perhaps half of the Senate GOP Caucus is likely to vote against any deal, a number of Republicans remain privately undecided on whether they would vote to disapprove of an Iran deal. \n ", " ", " \u201cIn the aftermath of an agreement, it is highly unlikely that Congress could put together a veto-proof majority to override a deal. I cannot see more than a handful of Democrats voting against the deal,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a centrist think tank. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some moderate Republicans such as Bob Corker evaluated the agreement on the merits and considered voting for it.\u201d \n ", " ", " But the potential for embarrassment on an international stage remains even if Congress can\u2019t muster a veto-proof majority. If Obama is forced to use his veto pen, that would mean the motion of disapproval had survived a filibuster in the Senate and that at least a half-dozen Democrats opposed the deal. That level of disapproval in Congress could undermine the perception of the agreement on the world stage. \n ", " ", " \u201cI\u2019m not saying that a motion to disapprove will even be the step that\u2019s taken,\u201d Corker said. \u201cBut in the event that something did occur of that nature and there were 60 votes and he vetoed it, it hugely diminishes the effectiveness\u201d of the Iran agreement. \n ", " ", " ", " \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

But one candidate \u2014 Marco Rubio \u2014 has emerged as the clear front-runner, according to nearly a half-dozen sources close to the multibillionaire casino mogul. ", " In recent weeks, Adelson, who spent $100 million on the 2012 campaign and could easily match that figure in 2016, has told friends that he views the Florida senator, whose hawkish defense views and unwavering support for Israel align with his own, as a fresh face who is \u201cthe future of the Republican Party.\u201d He has also said that Rubio\u2019s Cuban heritage and youth would give the party a strong opportunity to expand its brand and win the White House. ", "Story Continued Below", "TOM BARTLETT", " Winning the backing of the 81-year-old Adelson would give Rubio a serious boost in his quest for the 2016 Republican nomination. His campaign is predicated on the idea that he can appeal to a broad swath of primary voters and stay in the race long enough to outlast well-funded establishment favorites like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. To do so, he\u2019ll need the support of deep-pocketed contributors like Adelson, whose $32 billion net worth makes him the nation\u2019s 12th-richest person, according to ", ". ", " In 2012, Adelson\u2019s financial support allowed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to stay in the presidential race long after other donors gave up on him. ", " Adelson\u2019s attraction to Rubio is in no small part centered on the Florida senator\u2019s outspoken support for Israel, an issue near and dear to the billionaire\u2019s heart. Rubio has reached out to Adelson more often than any other 2016 candidate, sources close to Adelson say, and has provided him with the most detailed plan for how he\u2019d manage America\u2019s foreign policy. ", " Since entering the Senate in 2011, Rubio has met privately with the mogul on a half-dozen occasions. In recent months, he\u2018s been calling Adelson about once every two weeks, providing him with meticulous updates on his nascent campaign. During a recent trip to New York City, Rubio took time out of his busy schedule to speak by phone with the megadonor. ", " The connection is also personal. Adelson, whose father emigrated from Lithuania and worked as a cab driver, has come to admire Rubio, the son of a bartender and a hotel maid, for his compelling life story. On March 2, the two had a private dinner at Charlie Palmer, a posh steakhouse at the foot of Capitol Hill. There, they talked for hours about their families and personal lives. \u201cIt lasted quite a while,\u201d said one source close to Rubio. ", " Alex Conant, a Rubio spokesman, declined to comment on the outreach to Adelson. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss private meetings,\u201d he said. ", " Adelson has yet to declare his support for a 2016 candidate, and those familiar with his political views stress that he could ultimately get behind a candidate other than the Florida senator. But he\u2019s also provided subtle public hints about his leanings. On April 7, two Florida-based Adelson lobbyists, Scott Ross and Nick Iarossi, ", " a Rubio breakfast fundraiser in Tallahassee. ", " Andy Abboud, an Adelson spokesman who doubles as his political gatekeeper, wouldn\u2019t comment on the Rubio discussions other than to say: \u201cIt\u2019s a wide-open field and he\u2019s going to keep his powder dry until he needs to weigh in. He\u2019s excited about the field of candidates.\u201d ", " Should he make an endorsement, Adelson\u2019s advisers say, he would not do so until after the second Republican primary debate, which is expected be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, in September. But he\u2019s already playing a public role in the 2016 sweepstakes. This weekend, at his Venetian hotel, Adelson will preside over the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s spring meeting, a key cattle call for presidential aspirants. ", " In attendance will be a group of well-heeled Jewish Republican donors, many of whom see Adelson, who serves on the RJC\u2019s board of directors, as a leader. Ari Fleischer, who was a press secretary in the George W. Bush White House and is also active with the group, said most people in the coalition supported either Bush, Walker or Rubio. ", " \u201cI think there are many people at the RJC who are going to be influential in the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the people who aren\u2019t behind a candidate yet, including me, are shopping.\u201d ", " During the 2012 campaign, Adelson made his voice heard loud and clear. Of the $100 million he spent on Republican causes, about $15 million was devoted to supporting Gingrich, his favored candidate in the primary. His benevolence enabled the former House speaker, who was waging a long-shot campaign, to remain in the primary until late April. ", " This election, though, Adelson\u2019s advisers say he\u2019s determined to get behind a more mainstream candidate who has a better chance of becoming the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want the crazies to drive the party\u2019s prospects into the ground,\u201d said one person close to him. ", " He\u2019s held private meetings with most of the Republican candidates, many of whom have courted him with fervor. But he\u2019s become particularly fond of Rubio, who attended last year\u2019s RJC meeting but who will not be present this year. He has told some friends that the senator would offer the party a freshness that most other contenders, including Bush, cannot. ", " In private, Adelson, who\u2019s had labor disputes with workers at his Venetian property, has also said positive words about Walker and that he admired how Wisconsin governor handled his 2011 clash with organized labor. ", " But Adelson\u2019s desire to get behind an electable candidate may also mean that others with whom he has close ties will be left by the wayside. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who shares many of Adelson\u2019s foreign policy views, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who last year ", " an anti-Internet gambling bill that the casino magnate supported, will be appearing at the RJC confab on Saturday in hopes of winning the mogul\u2019s support. ", " But, Adelson\u2019s advisers say, there remain questions about whether either will be able to establish the kind of broad national following that would be needed to win the presidency. ", " For another 2016 hopeful, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, it\u2019s not about winning Adelson\u2019s endorsement \u2014 it\u2019s about making sure he doesn\u2019t come after him. ", " During an ", " on a Jewish-themed radio program last month, Paul, who\u2019s come under fire from the neoconservative wing of his party for his more isolationist foreign policy views, said he\u2019d recently had a private meeting with Adelson and his wife, Miriam, and asked him about a report that he was considering funding a campaign against him.

With a two-week recess scheduled to begin the following week and run through April 10, that window has created an incentive for candidates in federal office to formally announce. Cruz, by launching Monday, will get a head start on Paul, who is expected to announce in Louisville, Ky., on April 7, before embarking on a four-state tour the day after, with stops in New Hampshire, Charleston, S.C., Iowa City and Las Vegas. Paul\u2019s campaign also confirmed a speech in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on the USS Yorktown aircraft carrier. ", " Rubio\u2019s camp is also looking at the same time frame.

Those likely opponents, such as Ben Carson and Rick Santorum, aren\u2019t planning to announce until later in the spring. Yet Cruz could also be opening himself up as a target to other potential rivals, some of whom already haven\u2019t shied away from criticizing him.

", " Ted Cruz ad: 'Ted Cruz for President' ", "\n  ", " ", " But Cruz is embracing that outsider status, just as he did in Texas, where in 2012 he beat out the presumed Republican Senate nominee, former Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, and became a hero to that conservative state\u2019s tea party. He frequently compares the 2016 election dynamics to those of 1980 \u2014the year Ronald Reagan was elected.

", " \u201cIf we nominate another candidate in that same mold, the same voters who stayed home in 2008 and 2012 will stay home in 2016, and Hillary Clinton is the next president,\u201d he told POLITICO in December, after Jeb Bush announced he was considering a presidential bid. ", " In starting his campaign at Liberty University, a private Christian college founded in 1971 by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, Cruz is signaling that he will aggressively seek out the support of the party\u2019s socially conservative voters, a bloc with some degree of overlap with the tea party. ", " His father, Rafael Cruz, a pastor, spoke at Liberty in November 2013 about his experiences as a Cuban refugee and the need for Christians to be involved citizens. Ted Cruz himself spoke at Liberty in April 2014 about threats to religious liberty in America.

Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who is close to the Clintons, was initially scheduled to speak on Monday, the report said, and he declined the offer to share a stage with Cruz or remain the only speaker and push Cruz\u2019s event to the afternoon. ", " While Cruz will have some competition for the social conservative vote from potential candidates including Santorum and Mike Huckabee, he is well-positioned to compete in states like Iowa and South Carolina, where Christian conservatives are an influential bloc. The senator, who is comfortable using religious language, is slated to appear next month at the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators\u2019 \u201cHomeschool Day at the Capitol\u201d in Iowa. Later in the month he will be at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s spring kick-off in the Hawkeye State. ", " Aides said his announcement on Monday would highlight Cruz\u2019s oratorical skills, one of his chief strengths. During his two years in the Senate, Cruz \u2014 a former Texas solicitor general who has argued nine times before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 became best known for his pre-shutdown, 21-hour speech on the Senate floor in September 2013 in which he spoke of the need to defund Obamacare. ", " He has long been building contact lists for his leadership PAC, the Jobs, Growth and Freedom Fund, often asking people attending his speeches to text words such as \u201cgrowth\u201d to a designated number, which gets them signed up. On Sunday night, a text from the PAC promised an \u201cexciting announcement soon\u201d and urged recipients to keep an an eye on Twitter.

Not only did the lobbying reform bill fail to slow the revolving door, it created an entire class of professional influencers who operate in the shadows, out of the public eye and unaccountable. Of the 352 people who left Congress alive since the law took effect in January 2008, POLITICO found that almost half (47 percent) have joined the influence industry: 84 as registered lobbyists and 80 others as policy advisers, strategic consultants, trade association chiefs, corporate government relations executives, affiliates of agenda-driven research institutes and leaders of political action committees or pressure groups. Taken as a whole, more former lawmakers are influencing policy and public opinion now than before the reform was enacted: in a six-year period before the law, watchdog group Public Citizen found 43 percent of former lawmakers became lobbyists.

The 2007 law was deliberately watered down by lawmakers concerned about their own job prospects, POLITICO has learned from dozens of interviews with former legislators and staffers.

Grant in the lobby of the Willard Hotel. But it wasn\u2019t until after World War II, when the legislative branch underwent a sweeping modernization, that lobbyists had to register officially. That original disclosure law effectively let lobbyists decide for themselves whether they needed to register. In the 1970s, as the expansion of federal regulation touched more private interests, the lobbying industry surged. Power in Congress, once held closely by committee chairs, was shared more broadly among rank-and-file members, giving interest groups more openings for influence.

Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who was championing the Lobbying Disclosure Act. They were focused on finding a meaningful definition that did not unfairly burden the occasional petitioner, such as a CEO making one phone call, according to Linda J. Gustitus, who worked for Levin. Ultimately, the law stipulated that people needed to register only if they contacted more than one government official and if lobbying amounted to at least 20 percent of the time they spent on an individual client.", "Levin, knowing how susceptible to abuse this standard could be, proposed an enforcement office that could go after people skirting the rules, but the Senate scrapped that because too many members (and lobbyists) objected. \u201cTo set up another organization with more people being employed at the Justice Department really is just not called for,\u201d said Lott, then the Senate majority whip.", "By the time Reid rose to present the 2007 reform bill, the flaws in the definition had become the subject of insider ridicule.

Opponents in Congress and on K Street would call it an administrative burden and an assault on the First Amendment freedom of petition, derailing the entire bill. So even before the process got started, one of the key weaknesses of the existing law already had been placed off-limits. The draft never touched the definition, and there was never so much as a proposed amendment on the issue. \u201cWe knew the problem was there. We just couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d recalled Fred Wertheimer, founder of Democracy 21 and a key proponent of the bill. \u201cLet\u2019s keep in mind who wrote these bills: These were members of Congress.

The diamonds, for instance, are essential to sharpen machine tools and to make components for tanks, warships and bombers.", "But as it grew \u2014 including taking on the purchasing of some items for other customers such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Forestry Service and responding to a host of humanitarian disasters around the world \u2014 so did the warning signs that DLA was becoming too large for its own good.

The department's inspector general cited \"poor logistics management\" and \"cumbersome financial management\u201d and criticized the Pentagon for paying \"excessive prices for spare parts.\" The review also hit the agency for \"poor visibility\" over the location of items in transit to military units and for failing to transfer unneeded items to other branches before disposing of them. ", "The reports \u2014 and their monotonously similar complaints \u2014 just keep coming. ", "One recent example is the purchase of spare parts from Bell Helicopter and Boeing for the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft \u2014 a process managed by DLA for the Naval Supply Systems Command.", "The Pentagon inspector general reviewed 53 parts at random and discovered that DLA bought 22 too many of them, at a total cost of $9 million. The report concluded, with some understatement, that DLA \u201cdid not effectively manage government-owned V-22 Osprey spare parts.\u201d", "One of those parts was aircraft frames. Even though on average only two replacements are needed each year, DLA had purchased 166. That's a nearly 80-year supply, which is decades longer than the expected usefulness of the V-22 fleet. The inspector general also estimated that it will cost the Pentagon $700,000 to store all the unneeded equipment over the next five years.", "In response to the findings, DLA officials insisted they regularly review quantities of spare parts to prevent \"over-procurements.\" But the investigators found that while the process evaluated existing purchase orders, it \"did not evaluate whether existing spare parts inventory quantities were reasonable.\" ", "Another recent Pentagon IG report calculated that the government could save $7.2 million over six years if DLA would stop buying cars and trucks for government agencies that didn\u2019t need them.", "What it buys, it often overpays for. Earlier this year, DLA contracted to buy aircraft braking systems, but the officer in charge didn\u2019t do a sufficient price analysis, as required by regulations. According to an internal review designated \"for official use only,\" this oversight resulted in $8.5 million being overpaid for 32 different parts that were purchased without seeking other bids. ", "The GAO, the oversight arm of Congress, has repeatedly flagged systemic management problems at the agency. The congressional watchdog found in 2010 that \"the average annual value of the inventory for the 3 years reviewed was about $13.7 billion. Of this total, about $7.1 billion (52 percent) was beyond the amount needed to meet the requirements objective.\" ", "Translation: Half of what the DLA has purchased may never be used.

Chuck Schumer, one of Capitol Hill\u2019s most influential voices in the Iran nuclear debate, is strongly endorsing passage of a law opposed by President Barack Obama that would give Congress an avenue to reject the White House-brokered framework unveiled last week. \n ", " ", " The comments Monday by the Democratic leader-in-waiting illustrate the enormity of the task ahead for Obama and his team: While there\u2019s no guarantee that Congress would ultimately reject an agreement with Iran, there\u2019s an increasingly bipartisan consensus that Congress should at least have the ability to do so. \n ", " ", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cThis is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur,\u201d Schumer said in an emailed statement to POLITICO. \n ", " ", " Schumer had quietly signed on to a bill allowing congressional review of the Iran deal two weeks ago, but made little fanfare of his co-sponsorship. In a brief statement on Friday, he said only that he\u2019d review the agreement. Now that the outlines of an agreement are known, Schumer\u2019s emphatic statement that Congress has an important role becomes more significant, signaling to fellow Democrats that it\u2019s safe to jump on board the review bill. \n ", " ", " His comments came as the White House press secretary was panning the legislation, which was written by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and would allow Congress to vote to suspend the lifting of sanctions. A committee vote on the measure is planned for next week. \n ", " ", " Schumer is a potentially decisive figure in whether the Iran measure will eclipse veto-proof support in Congress, given his expected ascension to the Democratic leader\u2019s job in 2017 and the diminished influence of indicted Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who recently relinquished his position as the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel. \n ", " ", " Within the Senate Democratic Caucus, a dozen senators have either co-sponsored Corker\u2019s legislation or indicated they could support it. That would put the measure one vote shy of a veto-proof majority. On Monday, three more Democratic senators \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 left open the possibility of voting for it, according to aides. Their support, however, could hinge on whether Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the new ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, is able to negotiate concessions that alleviate concerns the bill could derail any agreement. \n ", " ", " Capitol Hill aides in both parties on Monday said it is not clear what changes Democrats will seek. The bill would give Congress 60 days to review the Iran framework by freezing sanction relief and allowing lawmakers the ability to formally disapprove or approve of the legislation. One possibility is to clarify that the legislation governs only congressional sanctions rather than ones that originated from global agreements or the White House. \n ", " ", " With no co-sponsors publicly backing away from Corker\u2019s bill in recent days, Democratic supporters said they have detected a shift in rhetoric from the White House. They pointed to Obama\u2019s comment to The New York Times over the weekend in which he ", "finding a legislative compromise \u201cthat allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives.\u201d \n ", " ", " \u201cI read what the president said last night, looking for a way to work with Congress on that. They are now in a realistic position: That Congress is going to weigh in,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who co-wrote the bill while making technical consultations with the White House. He called Obama\u2019s tone in that interview \u201cjust a recognition of the reality of the situation\u201d on Capitol Hill. \n ", " ", " But White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to entertain that possibility, telling reporters on Monday that the White House sees no way to reconcile Corker\u2019s bill with the president\u2019s mission of finishing Iran negotiations before Congress votes on anything. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt could potentially interfere with the ongoing negotiations,\u201d Earnest said, insisting that Congress wait until after the June 30 deadline for a final agreement before voting on the legislation. \n ", " ", " Such a delay appears increasingly unlikely, however. Corker said he plans to hold a committee vote on April 14, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed Monday that the full Senate will consider the bill shortly after that. \n ", " ", " Corker insists the point of his bill is to work in tandem with the negotiations. In a lengthy interview after the deal was announced, he repeatedly said he\u2019s been told by nuclear negotiators that simply introducing his bill with bipartisan support strengthened the president\u2019s hand. \n ", " ", " \u201cThey [the Iranians] believe that Congress is going to weigh in,\u201d Corker said of the White House. \u201cAnd I do realize that that\u2019s had a positive effect on the negotiations, which is one of our goals.\u201d \n ", " ", " Kaine said he carefully studied a bill spearheaded by Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) that would tighten sanctions if Iran reneges on an interim agreement or walks away from ongoing talks. He concluded that the sanctions bill might violate the spirit of the agreement, but the review measure does the opposite. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe argument that the Corker bill somehow interferes with the negotiations is a complete red herring,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI did not sign on to this bill because of an anti-diplomacy mind-set.\u201d \n ", " ", " Indeed, in interviews after the agreement was announced, few congressional Democrats were eager to see the deal fall apart even as they press for legislation the White House opposes. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe [Democrats] who do support it, support it on the principle of congressional review,\u201d said one Democratic source closely following the talks. \n ", " ", " If the GOP wants Congress to formally reject the lifting of sanctions on Iran \u2014 and likely kill the nuclear agreement \u2014 it faces an arduous task with no guarantee of success. First, Corker must rally and hold together at least 13 Democrats to support his approval bill, which then would likely face easy passage in the House. The president could then take his time vetoing the legislation before sending it back to the Hill for a high-stakes override vote. \n ", " ", " Then Republicans could file a motion of disapproval, a process established by the Corker bill that would set a high bar for rejecting the lifting of sanctions. That motion would also have to withstand a presidential veto, which means 13 Senate Democrats and dozens in the House would have to vote against the White House\u2019s deal. Even if a permanent deal was struck well before the June 30 deadline and the disapproval motion was filed immediately upon the bill\u2019s passage, the entire process could easily take until late May. ", " \n ", " \n ", " ", "And as Corker\u2019s bill moves through Congress, the White House would be free to continue ironing out the final technical document governing the deal. ", " Still, the administration is taking no chances. In addition to the one-on-one phone diplomacy being conducted by the president, Vice President Joe Biden and Cabinet officials during the congressional recess, the administration will hold an open briefing for House and Senate members on Wednesday at the State Department, a senior administration confirmed. \n ", " ", " Perhaps not coincidentally, Wednesday is also the deadline for senators to file amendments to Corker\u2019s bill in committee, where Democrats may stand their best chance of incorporating changes intended to soften the legislation. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for both Emanuel and Obama, said progressive groups tried to assert themselves but ignored Emanuel\u2019s record on everything from raising the minimum wage to expanding community college access, efforts that have become a partial model for the White House. ", " \u201cThere was a roadshow of national progressive groups that came into Chicago and tried to use the race to send a message about the issues and messages they cared about, but in some ways, they misjudged the race,\u201d LaBolt said. \u201cFor all the discussion there\u2019s been about ideological warfare within the party, ultimately it\u2019s more of the bread-and-butter issues that affect people\u2019s lives that are going to determine their vote.\u201d ", " The progressive groups that got involved in the race disagree about Emanuel\u2019s record.

But \u201cif any of these campaigns had anybody on the ground in Chicago and seen the level of energy around Chuy\u2019s campaign and around the aldermen who were running, they would understand this.\u201d ", " and ", " Instead its \u201cpopulist groundswell gave Chuy Garc\u00eda a fighting chance,\u201d as Reclaim Chicago of the National People\u2019s Action Campaign put it Tuesday night. ", " Garc\u00eda was, at best, an imperfect messenger for progressives: Unlike Bill de Blasio who became a national progressive hero by winning a much different New York City mayor\u2019s race in 2013, Garc\u00eda was often short on both policy detail and political skill. De Blasio took heat for pledging to raise taxes on the rich for his ideas. Garc\u00eda repeatedly ducked questions of how he\u2019d pay for his. ", " The Chicago runoff never got close enough for Obama to seriously consider a last-minute visit to push his former chief of staff over the top, according to a White House aide. Instead, Emanuel\u2019s campaign spent millions on an image-softening push that closed with a final commercial of the mayor, sporting an open-collar shirt and with soft piano music playing in the background, touting his all-day kindergarten program and the new jobs he brought to all neighborhoods \u2014 and acknowledging he could try being a better person himself. ", " Although a presidential race will mean everyone\u2019s paying a lot more attention to every position Clinton takes and every element of her record, she\u2019s not expected to have a progressive primary opponent such as Elizabeth Warren to draw off votes. Unlike Emanuel, she\u2019ll also have a Republican opponent, one elected out of a field that\u2019s sure to produce a candidate progressives won\u2019t be able to stand and will rally against even if their hearts aren\u2019t with Clinton.

", " \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the problem that he does \u2014 the \u2018asshole\u2019 factor,\u201d said a Democratic strategist familiar with both the Emanuel and de Blasio campaigns. \u201cIf I were Hillary Clinton looking at Chicago, I would say Rahm found himself in trouble largely because of personality clashes, and he survived because he was laser-focused on making his campaign an expression of his progressive successes.\u201d ", " But it\u2019s clear that progressives are less than enthusiastic about Clinton, and unions and other lefty groups are likely to start popping off soon about how this really might be the year when they\u2019ll sit out, or vote for someone else. ", " \u201cThis is a new era. There is a much more progressive bench of this party, and the energy of this party is in the progressive party. That is going to be the key to voter turnout and voter engagement in 2016,\u201d Dean said. ", " But as one measure, Dean\u2019s brother, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, endorsed Garc\u00eda but has already endorsed Clinton. De Blasio is taking pains to stay close to her. ", " Garc\u00eda\u2019s 43 percent \u201ceven as he was dramatically outspent and despite the challenges he faced shows the power of the idea that government and the economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d said Nick Berning, communications director of MoveOn.org. \u201cThe lesson elected officials should draw from Chicago is that they ignore this hunger at their peril.\u201d ", " Begala said he\u2019s not concerned. If anything, he thinks Democrats should come out of Chicago feeling good about the unity within the party that produced a low-impact challenger for Emanuel and a seemingly untouchable front-runner for president, unlike the giant ideological rifts that Republican 2016 candidates are trying to navigate.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) shot back that his counterpart\u2019s complaints were \u201cillogical\u201d and devoid of facts. \n ", " ", " The sweeping Medicare payments package that the Senate passed overwhelmingly Tuesday night contains so-called Hyde Amendment language that would bar community health centers from using federal money to fund abortions. The abortion provision in the trafficking bill is similar, but instead of applying those restrictions to taxpayer funds, it would be for fines paid from trafficking offenders \u2014 which Democrats say goes too far. \n ", " ", " \u201cDemocrats couldn\u2019t possibly justify voting for Hyde language in order to help doctors, as they did hours ago, but then look an abused victim in the eye and tell her she\u2019s not worth it,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAll that\u2019s needed now are a couple more Democrats willing to show the same level of compassion to enslaved victims they offered to doctors just a few hours ago.\u201d \n ", " ", " Cornyn has offered an amendment that he says should assuage Democrats\u2019 concerns. It would essentially rewrite language in the trafficking bill to mirror the abortion language in the Medicare measure. It would make the restitution fund in the trafficking bill \u2014 the source of the abortion dispute \u2014 be filled by appropriations, and the fines from traffickers would instead go directly to the Treasury. \n ", " ", " But Democrats promptly rejected the offer. Reid called McConnell\u2019s argument as \u201cillogical as can be\u201d because it\u2019s standard for Hyde Amendment restrictions to apply to federal spending bills, whereas Cornyn\u2019s compromise would still expand those curbs on abortion. \n ", " ", " \u201cWe are not going to stand by to enlarge this so-called Hyde Amendment to private money,\u201d Reid fumed. He added that McConnell and Cornyn \u201cfeel that this is their opportunity to broaden Hyde, and we\u2019re not going to allow that to happen. It would be wrong.\u201d \n ", " ", " The heated rhetoric was also a quick departure from the bipartisan bonanza of just the day before, when senators successfully brokered the congressional oversight bill on Iran then, hours later, overwhelmingly passed the major Medicare bill assembled by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \n ", " ", " The trafficking impasse began when Democrats unanimously helped the GOP carry the bill to the floor and then noticed the abortion language, leading to a saga with more twists and turns than on any bill that the full Senate has considered this year. \n ", " ", " Reid said Democrats have offered McConnell 10 amendments privately, while McConnell and Cornyn have now tried three times to get Democrats to approve the trafficking bill. But just four Democrats voted for those GOP offers, two short of the number needed to break a filibuster. Reid said the GOP is \u201cunwilling to compromise,\u201d while McConnell said it\u2019s time for \u201csenators of conscience to stand up and end this filibuster now.\u201d \n ", " ", " A vote on Cornyn\u2019s latest offer is expected on Thursday. But it will fail, according to senior Democratic aides, leaving Lynch\u2019s nomination on ice for at least a little while longer. \n ", " ", " Still, that gives more time for undecided Republicans to make up their mind. Key swing GOP votes include Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

The Sierra Club\u2019s data-driven effort now spans 45 states, and it has claimed credit for ensuring the demise of 188 coal plants whose owners have announced plans to shutter or repurpose them since 2010.

I don\u2019t think we have to do it, and nor do you.\u201d ", " True to form, Bloomberg punctuated his speech with data points, making the case that the 188 coal plant retirements since 2010 will result in 7,500 fewer heart attacks and 80,000 fewer asthma attacks this year. ", " But there\u2019s one data point he seemed frustrated not to have. \u201cThe unfortunate thing is we don\u2019t know the names of those people who would have died from a heart attack or died from cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could, it would resonate a lot more with the public.\u201d ", " Later in the day, he received a different sort of honor: The British government ", " an \u201cHonorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire\u201d during a ceremony that included a toast from Vice President Joe Biden.

", " He\u2019s pleased that the first three Republican senators to announce their bids \u2014 Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio \u2014 are all allies of the 501(c)(4) group. Rubio, for instance, will visit Heritage\u2019s offices at noon Wednesday to speak about his tax plan.

He has helped craft a more muscular role for the group\u2019s policy and political wings, which has often led to conflict with congressional leadership. These new candidate assessments could further burnish his influence.

The reports will look at the records of the candidates who have them, their current platforms and their visions for the future. ", " The Club for Growth releases detailed white papers on the fiscal records of each presidential candidate, with the first coming soon. The Club, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, FreedomWorks and the American Conservative Union also score members of Congress based on key votes.

Ultimately, they\u2019d do it if they felt that the race came down to a clear movement conservative and a candidate they felt was squishy on the issues most important to them. ", " Needham explained the scenario: \u201cIf we got to a point where we felt there was somebody out there who could really become a leader that would do for conservatism coming out of the Obama presidency what Ronald Reagan did coming out of the Jimmy Carter presidency \u2014 and that other people perhaps would take us more in the direction of the big government of President [George W.] Bush or the K Street cronyism of John Boehner \u2014 then certainly we\u2019d want to not leave tools on the board.\u201d ", " There would be drawbacks to an official endorsement \u2014 especially if they backed a losing horse, and the winner became president. It\u2019s less likely as long as the organization has several friends in the race. ", " and ", " ", "Needham faulted the House for passing a bill that makes it harder for states to opt out of the No Child Left Behind Act.

So when you look at Marco, here\u2019s somebody who on one issue at a point in time was bad but has been a policy innovator.

But when you look at Jeb, there\u2019s also reasons to look at his relationship with the business wing and the more establishment part of the party.

", " But mainly, Clinton hasn\u2019t offered many clues about how her presidency would do more than serve as essentially Obama\u2019s third term: How would she try to fix flaws in Obama\u2019s signature health care law? Would she crack down on Wall Street or the National Security Agency? Would she break with Obama in pushing for fast-track trade deals? ", " Answers to those and other questions can probably wait, some in both parties say. \u201cThere will be plenty of time for policy and serious discussion,\u201d veteran New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf said. \u201cThis is the entertainment part of the event.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), a former presidential nominee himself, said Clinton\u2019s take-it-slow approach is smart \u201cif she can get away it.\u201d ", " But sooner or later, people are going to want answers. For the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal Elizabeth Warren wing, a major question for Clinton will be how zealously her administration would police Wall Street, whether banks remain \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and whether the lack of prosecutions following the 2008 financial collapse is a black mark on Obama\u2019s Justice Department.

But they\u2019re not the main issues that have been crucial to her public image during her decades of political life, which have encompassed education reform in Arkansas, her attempt at a national health care overhaul in the early 1990s, her foreign policy focus as secretary of state, her several books and her longtime role as a champion of women\u2019s rights. ", " Then again, Clinton may not feel much pressure to fill in her platform quickly. Not only does she have an extensive track record and tremendous name recognition, but she\u2019s standing alone in the Democratic field \u2014 at least until someone like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb jumps in. In contrast, the dozens of potential and declared Republican contenders need to fight from Day One to stand out from their rivals with segments of their party. ", " Tad Devine, a longtime consultant to Democratic presidential candidates, agreed. ", " \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for her to lay out an entire platform for the future of government in the first 48 hours,\u201d said Devine, who had just spent the weekend in Vermont with another potential White House contender, independent Sen.

The more confusion Republicans have, the better it is for her. The longer the confusion lasts, the better for her.\u201d ", " In the meantime, the GOP is all too happy just to tar Clinton with Obama\u2019s policies. \u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary Clinton can\u2019t say she\u2019s for middle class Americans and the working poor when she\u2019s 100 percent behind the Obama regulatory regime that\u2019s making it more expensive for them to keep the lights on, keep their jobs and put food on the table,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said by email.

Tougher sanctions would only isolate Washington, not pressure Tehran.", "\n                    By SAMUEL R. BERGER", "Some are insisting on a \u201cbetter deal\u201d than the framework nuclear agreement reached with Iran on April 2. But the idea of a better deal is a chimera, an illusory option, and it should not lull us into thinking there is another agreement to be had if only we were to bear down harder. The present agreement, which depends on important pieces to be resolved by the end of June, can substantially reduce the ability of Iran to develop a nuclear weapon over the next ten years or more and also creates a dynamic that could be a game changer in the combustible Middle East. ", " Senator Mark Kirk has postponed a vote on the Iran sanctions bill he wrote with Senator Robert Menendez, possibly until June 30. This is a constructive step, avoiding an action that would undercut negotiations toward a final agreement. But we need to keep the sanctions issue in mind because it is inextricably intertwined with the same calls for a better deal emanating from people in Congress, Israel, and other critics. No one can argue that a better agreement wouldn\u2019t be better\u20143,000 Iranian centrifuges is better than 5,000; a 20-year deal is better than 10. The tough question is: How do you get there? Putting aside what the Iranians might do in response to additional pressure\u2014dig in deeper, speed up their program\u2013and looking just at our side of the equation, the notion of a better deal is unachievable. ", "Story Continued Below", " Here is why. According to critics, seeking a better deal starts with increasing sanctions on Iran. If tough sanctions brought them to the table, tougher sanctions will bring them to their knees. At some point their economy will be in tatters from the intensified sanctions, and they will be forced to return to the bargaining table and agree to better deal. With a closer look, however, this scenario unravels. ", " First, it is highly unlikely that even our allies in Europe would join us in further sanctions against Iran in the wake of a nuclear agreement they believe is sensible and positive. That is even truer for other countries\u2014like India, Japan, South Korea and China\u2014that were pulled into the existing sanctions regime quite unwillingly. The support of these countries for the oil sanctions in particular has been critical to the sanctions\u2019 effectiveness. They will not willingly sign up for more. ", " Second, if a deal falls through, it is likely that the existing multilateral sanctions regime will begin to crumble. As noted, countries like India and South Korea, who don\u2019t feel threatened by an Iran nuclear weapon, will be only too happy to find a pretext to break out of the sanctions\u2014perhaps tentatively at first but in a rush as others do. It will be hard to argue the rationale for sanctions, which, from the perspective of nearly every nation, will have achieved their purpose\u2014bringing Iran to the table to negotiate serious limitations on its nuclear program. ", " Indeed, the proponents of tougher sanctions to get a \u201cbetter\u201d deal have misunderstood the nature of the Iranian sanctions. The fact is that the United States does not own or control the multilateral sanctions regime. The effectiveness of the sanctions is based on how the international community views the perceived threat and therefore the legitimacy of coercive actions to stop it. ", " Third, those who seek a better deal through tougher sanctions argue that we don\u2019t necessarily need international support. The United States could unilaterally enact sanctions that have extraterritorial reach, as we already have done with a number of Congressional measures since 2010. The proposition is that we will to some degree deny foreign companies access to the larger, more important American market, if they choose to do business with Iran. ", " However, the context has entirely changed since the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act was passed in 2010. New extraterritorial sanctions would be directed against an Iran that has reached an agreement on its nuclear program with major world powers. The rest of the world generally detests our assertion of authority involving foreign companies in foreign countries. Here, for example, we would seek to close the U.S. market to Germany\u2019s BMW if they sold cars to Iran or Japan\u2019s Sony if it sold in Iran. If Congress imposed sanctions in spite of a nuclear agreement reached with Iran by major powers, the international community\u2014except for a few countries\u2014would believe those sanctions to be illegitimate. In this context, it is hard to imagine the U.S. government moving ahead with major sanctions proceedings against many of our friends and allies. ", " So, as we discuss and debate the merits of this framework agreement, and a final agreement that may follow, let\u2019s recognize that this is the agreement we will have\u2014not some imagined alternative. In my judgment, if the next stage of negotiations succeeds, the framework that emerged this week lays the groundwork for a strong and effective agreement. ", "By ", "By SAM YOUNGMAN", "By MICHAEL SHERMER", " The framework does not\u2014nor by itself is it likely to\u2014fundamentally alter the other threats Iran poses in the region, including its ongoing efforts to exert control in Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad and Sanaa, and its continuing threat to Israel. That is why it is important to embed this agreement in a regional strategy that bolsters concrete cooperation with our friends in the region and reassures them that we are there for the long haul. President Obama\u2019s summit with regional partners at Camp David will be an important opportunity to look not only at the hot spots, but at the bigger picture. ", " The Iran nuclear agreement is important not despite other troubles in the region but because of them. Each challenge would be more difficult and dangerous if Iran\u2019s nuclear program was unconstrained and unmonitored, let alone if Iran were to develop a nuclear weapon and spark others in the region to follow. Under the agreement that is emerging, we will have a high degree of confidence\u2014as will others in the region\u2014that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is seriously constrained. Walling off the nuclear threat does not extinguish the fires that are burning in the region. But it does remove what would be the most combustible fuel. ", " There is no second bite at this apple. This is a good deal. We should not be distracted by talk of a better one. ", " Enacting new, tough sanctions in an effort to force Iran toward a \u201cbetter\u201d deal would mystify and alarm the rest of the world, isolating and weakening us.

But in a ", " Friday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the administration\u2019s in-house experts have put in lots of work on the science, and said the breakdown of many of Iran\u2019s centrifuges is one of the key provisions that would help guarantee that Iran couldn\u2019t build a bomb in less than a year. \n ", " ", " Harf insisted that \u201cour experts at [the Department of Energy] and the labs \u2014 nonpolitical, nonpartisan people who have served under Democratic and Republican administrations \u2014 they are confident in the science behind what we have done that with this equation, we get to at least a year breakout time.\u201d \n ", " ", " Liberal groups like MoveOn.org have helped to amplify the administration\u2019s other main sales pitch: that the alternative to this deal is war.

", " Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s political advisers weren\u2019t so sure. ", "Story Continued Below", " As a pair of deal-making Republicans deeply disliked by elements of the GOP base \u2014 Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham \u2014 were working with senators from both parties to draft an immigration bill, top Rubio hands flatly warned the Florida freshman not to go there. The advisers feared nothing would be worse for his chances in a potential presidential campaign than being associated with \u201camnesty\u201d for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. ", " Rubio didn\u2019t take the advice. And two years later, immigration remains the freshman senator\u2019s No. 1 liability in his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination \u2014 though not necessarily the deal breaker it appeared to be after the reform effort Rubio helped shepherd to passage in the Senate hit a brick wall in the House. ", " \u201cEverybody likes Marco Rubio,\u201d said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated commentator. But \u201cI still don\u2019t hear his name from conservatives at all, and I think the Gang of Eight\u201d \u2014 the bipartisan group of senators that pushed the most sweeping immigration overhaul in a generation \u2014 \u201chas a lot to do with that.\u201d ", " Even so, the political damage to Rubio has clearly subsided over time, in no small part due to Rubio\u2019s repeated disavowal of the entire reform exercise. In the days ahead of his presidential campaign launch in Miami Monday evening, some critics on the tea party right concede he has resuscitated himself politically, though the true effect may not be apparent until much deeper into the 2016 primary season. ", " \u201cWhat I think everyone over here underestimated is how difficult it is to pass massive pieces of legislation on any subject \u2014 not just immigration \u2014 given the rightful distrust the people have about the federal government,\u201d Rubio said in a recent interview in the Capitol. ", " Said Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots: \u201cI think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don\u2019t do: He evaluated what went wrong \u2026 [and] is working to make sure he doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.\u201d ", " Still, even if immigration won\u2019t be a central message of his presidential campaign, it will be an inescapable part of his record and his own personal narrative. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio announced his presidential run at the Freedom Tower in Miami \u2014 an Ellis Island of the South that served as a welcoming point for Cuban exiles into America. ", " The issue is also bound to be re-litigated by his opponents and voters, as it has during early appearances this year at a New Hampshire town hall and Iowa book signing. When pressed on the matter on the campaign trail, Rubio plans to tell voters that the comprehensive bill he co-authored will never pass Congress. ", " In his latest book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio argues that the approach he took in 2013 on immigration \u2014 one single bill to reform the entire system \u2014 was \u201csimply not realistic.\u201d He can assert that, Rubio says, because he knows of the experience firsthand. ", " \u201cEvery massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,\u201d Rubio said in the interview. ", " Instead, Rubio is renewing an argument he made originally that Congress should take up immigration reform in pieces, starting with proposals that Republicans largely support such as enforcement at the southern border, a mandatory electronic system to verify the legal status of employees and a new method to track people who overstay their visas. He\u2019ll argue that deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally is improbable, and call for an onerous series of steps to allow some to stay in the country. And a President Rubio would only entertain that possibility of citizenship after a enforcement-minded immigration laws are enacted first. ", " Such talk \u2014 and his decision to back away away from his own bill \u2014 seem to have alleviated some concern on the right that Rubio is not another McCain or Graham. ", " Yet it\u2019s also opened him to charges that the GOP lawmaker flip-flopped on the issue when the political temperature got too hot \u2013 simply to pander to the base of the party, and potentially leaving himself vulnerable to Latino voters in a general election. ", " In June 2013, the same month that his immigration bill passed the Senate, a ", " showed that his \u201cstrongly favorable\u201d ratings among Republicans had tumbled by 11 points since the previous August. ", " Rubio began to make amends with conservatives. Immediately after the bill passed the chamber, he shifted his attention to a range of economic reforms and other matters. He refused to call on the GOP-led House to pass the Senate bill, even as the other seven co-authors planned an aggressive public pressure campaign on House Republicans. ", " Rubio blamed President Barack Obama for scuttling the bill\u2019s chances, saying no conservative trusts the White House to implement the border control provisions. Republicans in the House agreed. ", " His shift to the right didn\u2019t stop there. At the height of last summer\u2019s border crisis, Rubio called for the 2012 Obama administration program that halts deportations of young undocumented immigrants \u2014 an initiative highly popular with Latinos \u2014 to eventually end. ", " Critics say his handling of immigration feeds the perception that Rubio lacks any significant legislative accomplishments in his short time in the Senate. And immigration activists who were once impressed with Rubio for taking on the politically fraught task of writing a reform bill now see him as a sell-out. ", "MICHAEL GRUNWALD and ", " \u201cEvery time he gets on his knees and begs for forgiveness from the nativist right in the GOP, I cringe,\u201d said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate who leads America\u2019s Voice, a left-leaning, pro-reform group. \u201cHe will always be known as the guy who stood up for something he seemed to believe in and backed down when it was politically convenient to do so.\u201d ", " It\u2019s unclear how Rubio would fare among Latino voters if he were to win the GOP nomination. The polling firm Latino Decisions found in a November survey of Latino voters that Rubio is viewed favorably by 31 percent of Latinos vs. 36 percent who saw him unfavorably. About one-third of those voters had not heard of Rubio, or had any opinion on the senator. ", " Despite concerns for some on the right, public polls show the senator still has a serious chance to win a wide-open race. A ", " from March showed that 56 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Rubio \u2014 a higher figure than received by any other of the 13 GOP contenders listed by the poll. ", " Perhaps that\u2019s because Rubio has moved to ensure he\u2019s not identified strictly with the immigration issue. He\u2019s been laying out economic reform ideas, from making higher education more affordable to helping narrow the income gap. At the same time, he has maintained his staunchly conservative views on social issues and foreign policy. ", " \u201cI\u2019m struck by how much he has recovered,\u201d said Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, who two years ago ", " to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the Gang of Eight. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on it, but there do seem to be some politicians whom lots of voters want to like and are eager to forgive for their mistakes,\u201d Kristol said, citing Ronald Reagan as an example. \u201cOthers who are less likable get held to a stricter standard. So Rubio\u2019s apparent comeback over the last couple of years may indicate a kind of underlying strength there that one might not have expected.\u201d ", " Yet, Rubio is still likely to be the left of the likes of Ted Cruz when it comes to immigration reform. ", " In \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio said he would address immigrants already here illegally once Congress has passed enforcement proposals and turned the current legal immigration system into one based on merit and economic considerations, not family ties. ", " At that point, he said he would institute a system to register those here illegally, deporting ones who have committed serious crimes or who have not been in the United States long enough. Undocumented immigrants who pay a fine, learn English and undergo background checks could then obtain a temporary legal status, something they would have to hold for at least 10 years before applying for permanent residence. ", " Rubio said he would not create a so-called special pathway, meaning a way to obtain citizenship that isn\u2019t afforded to other immigrants. That highly contentious provision \u2014 to provide a pathway to citizenship \u2014 was included in the Gang of Eight proposal. ", " \u201cHe not going to run away from it, he\u2019s going to talk about it,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership, a group that advocates for conservative causes among Latinos. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to say that it\u2019s important to deal with the issue.\u201d ", " Aguilar, who has lobbied GOP lawmakers on immigration reform, said Rubio should have tried harder to recruit other conservative Republicans to the Gang of Eight so he wasn\u2019t the sole emissary charged with selling the bill to the right. One target might have been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was considered part of the group in its early stages. ", " But still, many Republicans said Rubio should get political credit for at least trying to solve a tough issue. ", " \u201cWhat cannot be denied is that while many of his colleagues will be critical, they have yet to propose any viable solution to a problem that everybody in the United States understands is there,\u201d said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who is backing Jeb Bush but says he\u2019s a \u201chuge admirer\u201d of his home-state senator. \u201cRubio had the courage to take on a very, very controversial issue.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

While few are willing to talk details, sources close to his finance team say that if Rubio can raise $50 million by the beginning of 2016, he can be competitive in the first four primaries.

He\u2019s got a lot of folks in Miami who are for him and he has pockets around the state of folks who helped him run for Senate, or have been involved when he ran the Florida House.\u201d ", " He\u2019s got an aggressive schedule out of the box with money events later this week in New York and Boston followed up by fundraisers next week in Houston, Dallas, South Carolina and Palm Beach, Florida, according to a source close to his finance operation. Rubio will also make the fundraising rounds in California later this month. ", " Supporters have also officially launched a super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, that has been in the works for more than a year. Donors like Miami billionaire Norman Braman have already signaled an openness to cut big checks for that effort. ", " Rubio backers also say the Florida Republican\u2019s foreign policy experience is exciting donors focused on Israel, which could help him get big donors like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and New York finance billionaire Paul Singer into his camp. Rubio, who is the first Cuban American Republican senator, is also expected to tap Cuban American donors, who haven\u2019t played a big role in previous presidential elections. And while Bush has focused on getting cash in the door, Rubio has been doing a soft sell meeting with donors like the one in New York organized by Singer last month that they hope will pay dividends now that he is an official candidate. ", " Rubio didn\u2019t waste any time trying to gin up his top donors and fundraisers. He met Monday morning with roughly 100 of his top donors and bundlers from Georgia, Washington, D.C., and Florida, among other states, for a finance meeting at the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay. ", " Rubio talked about the need to raise money and said he was going to launch a \u201ccampaign of ideas\u201d and draw a distinct difference to Hillary, said one attendee. ", " The Florida Republican followed that with a national donor call walking key supporters through his case to become president. Senior staff have a lunch followed by peer-to-peer calls Monday afternoon before heading to the Freedom Tower for the official announcement. ", " Following the announcement, Rubio is headed to Boston and New York for fundraisers later this week. He\u2019ll also go to New Hampshire and Iowa in short order for campaign events. A Washington, D.C., fundraiser is also in the works for April 30 at the home of Lea and Wayne Berman. ", " So far, Rubio\u2019s finance team has locked down between 30 and 40 bundlers, according to multiple sources. High-profile finance backers like developer Bob Pence of Virginia and George Seay of Texas, who raised money for then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry in 2012, have helped lend credibility to Rubio\u2019s money operation. He\u2019s also attracted some early attention from the Koch brothers\u2019 conservative network, ", " an informal straw poll taken earlier this year.

She is joined by Derinda Moss and Carmen Miller Spence. Rubio isn\u2019t expected to name a finance chairman immediately, but sources close to the campaign said his finance operation will grow fairly rapidly in the coming weeks. ", " Veteran Florida Republican consultant Rick Wilson said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cwrite off his ability\u201d to post big numbers out of Florida and beyond, noting that Rubio has already gone up against the entire Republican establishment in Florida in his first Senate bid and was able to find key donors who supported his campaign. ", " Since 2009, Rubio has raised roughly $36 million through his campaign committee and leadership PAC, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Rubio\u2019s first quarter 2015 haul is expected to be more than $1 million, according to sources familiar with his finance operation. While that is a drop in the bucket for what a presidential finance operation will need to raise, Rubio donors said his team was happy with his early performance and that it was a signal of what was to come. Rubio held a fundraiser in Tallahassee last week that Adelson attended, though Adelson operatives said it was not a sign that he is backing Rubio for president in 2016.

Many Democrats are demanding that the measure be amended so it doesn\u2019t kill the deal before it can be finalized by a June 30 deadline.

Corker said he\u2019s open to changing the bill, although he\u2019s going to have to balance Democratic demands with hawks in his own party who would prefer to scuttle the agreement. ", " It may be late April or even May before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can bring the Iran bill to the floor.

", " According to Corker, the current bill wouldn\u2019t upend the deal. \u201cThey want to make sure our bill completely aligns with the way the political framework is. But it does. Every day that goes by I feel better about the substance of legislation,\u201d he said in an interview. ", " The battle will play out in Corker\u2019s committee in mid-April. He\u2019s open to voting on a number of amendments, but changes viewed as too administration-friendly or controversial could lead to a stalemate, since there are Republicans on the committee who want to move the measure in the opposite direction. ", " Earlier versions of Corker\u2019s bill essentially gave Congress veto authority over the deal. But the Tennessee Republican has softened the measure so it allows Capitol Hill to vote only on whether to lift sanctions and requires the White House to file quarterly reports on Iran\u2019s adherence to a deal.

His support, he said Friday, \u201cdepends on the changes made to the bill, and it depends on the level of engagement on the White House.\u201d ", " Republicans worry that Democrats are looking for excuses to side with the administration rather than take a confrontational stance toward Iran. ", " \u201cSo many are voices of support of Israel. But I think in too many cases it\u2019s lip service,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).

The Senate as a whole will look at what\u2019s before us and respond in a sober way.\u201d ", " But there\u2019s already been enough partisan squabbling on Iran to fill a book, and a shifting group of Democrats have declared common cause with Republicans before, only to be wooed away by White House lobbying. ", " Republicans first tried moving forward with a measure that would impose harsh sanctions on Tehran. But, sensing the direct sanctions approach was losing support with Democrats, the GOP switched tactics and produced Corker\u2019s bill, which allows Congress to play a role in finalizing any deal. ", " Work on Corker\u2019s bill has already been delayed after House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress on Iran. Many Democrats viewed the speech as an insult to the president.

After lobbying from the administration, lawmakers agreed to give President Barack Obama more time to negotiate until Corker\u2019s April 14 committee vote.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.), reemphasized their support for legislation even in the wake of the historic announcement, calling the Corker measure one that \u201csets up a clear and constructive process for Congress to weigh in on any final deal that touches upon the statutory sanctions Congress has enacted.\u201d ", "CHARLES DUELFER", " Obama challenged lawmakers preemptively in his Thursday speech, asking whether a verifiable deal with Iran \u201cis a worse option than another war in the Middle East.\u201d ", " \u201cIf Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it\u2019s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy, international unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen,\u201d Obama added. ", " And shortly after he spoke his top aides began working the phones. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) got a phone call from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power urging him to keep an open mind, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) got a telephone briefing from Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Obama himself called Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and said he\u2019d soon be in contact with other congressional leaders, including Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ", " Many Republicans won\u2019t be swayed. Johnson said he was trying to keep an open mind but also suggested that Corker\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t go far enough, suggesting instead that Congress should declare the nuclear deal a treaty that must be ratified by the Senate. ", " \u201cWe could have a very simple bill that basically says, that no matter what President Obama says, we are going to call this a treaty and we are going to ratify this as a treaty,\u201d Johnson said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about the complexity of Corker\u2019s bill. ", " Many of Johnson\u2019s colleagues went straight into the blistering criticisms, summoning their choicest rhetoric to pan Obama\u2019s negotiating acumen after railing against the ongoing negotiations for months. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said no agreement was struck, describing Thursday\u2019s announcement as simply a \u201clist of dangerous concessions.\u201d ", " and ", " And in a telephone interview, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) reiterated that his leaders should give his sanctions bill a vote and blasted the president\u2019s announcement and a top State Department negotiator, Wendy Sherman. ", " \u201cI would say that Neville Chamberlain got a lot more out of Hitler than Wendy Sherman got out of Iran,\u201d Kirk said. ", " Meanwhile, Republican presidential contenders said the administration was pursuing a seriously flawed nuclear deal that gives away too much while getting little in return. \u201cThese negotiations began, by President Obama\u2019s own admission, as an effort to deny Iran nuclear capabilities, but instead will only legitimize those activities,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a statement. \u201cI cannot stand behind such a flawed agreement.\u201d ", " Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, was more critical, saying the agreement \u201crewards an enemy, undermines our allies and threatens our safety.\u201d And Sen. Marco Rubio called it \u201cjust the latest example of this administration\u2019s farcical approach to Iran.\u201d ", " The main event, though, will be courting Democrats. And some aren\u2019t inclined to support Corker. Murphy said that as long as the president\u2019s negotiators are telling him that Iran votes would scuttle negotiations, he will hold off on supporting congressional approval legislation. ", " \u201cCorker\u2019s desire to move his bill exists independent of the contents of the deal. Bob just believes he\u2019s got to pass this bill. I disagree,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMy feelings about the Corker proposal are completely interdependent on the level of concern from our negotiators.\u201d ", " Indeed, with the framework in hand and some members like Murphy already satisfied with giving the administration room and time to negotiate, Obama\u2019s outreach will focus on Democrats who have signaled support for either Corker\u2019s bill or one that would snap sanctions back on Iran if it reneges on any part of an agreement. ", " But on-the-fence Democrats are also waiting for a signal from leaders in Tehran. Will Iran step forward and publicly embrace Obama\u2019s description of an agreement that would pull apart two-thirds of the country\u2019s centrifuges? And will Iran accept the president\u2019s claim that the deal prevents Tehran from making a nuclear weapon? ", " That, said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), is the sticking point. ", " \u201cIf the Iranians do not publicly agree to what the president says they\u2019ve agreed to, then I\u2019m ready to vote for both bills,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cIf Iran cares what Congress does, the first step is to publicly agree to what the president puts out.\u201d ", " The White House has repeatedly lobbied Democrats away from supporting either bill on the Senate floor, and as McConnell prepares his chamber to vote on Corker\u2019s bill, Obama and his aides are moving quickly to stifle Democratic support. The White House is less worried about members like Murphy and Reid, and instead will concentrate on members like Cardin and Democratic-leader-in-waiting Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who\u2019s a co-sponsor of Corker\u2019s bill and Kirk\u2019s sanctions legislation. ", " Schumer didn\u2019t tip his hand on Thursday.

In the next three months, this structure is meant to be filled out with details regarding the scale of Iran\u2019s enrichment capacity and the stages of sanctions relief. If the devil is in the detail, much mischief may await us. ", " However, even before all this happens, the Iranian nuclear drama is proving to be one of the most curious arms control episodes in history. As the scale of American concessions becomes evident, the White House and its defenders seldom justify the emerging accord strictly on terms of the proliferation threat that remains. Their response is often limited to claiming that an admittedly imperfect agreement is still preferable to the alternatives. And the alternatives are usually painted in hysterical terms with Iran surging toward the bomb, the sanctions regime collapsing and an isolated United States helplessly watching all this unfold. Not for the first time, the Obama administration is demonstrating a poor understanding of Iran\u2019s strategies, the resilience of the sanctions regime and the nature of the international system. ", "Story Continued Below", " By this time the essential contours of the agreement are all obvious. The accord will leave Iran with a sizeable enrichment capacity and none of its facilities will be shuttered as was once contemplated. The agreement\u2019s most important sunset clause will be 10 years upon whose expiration, all essential restriction on Iran\u2019s enrichment infrastructure will collapse. In essence, Iran can then move toward an industrial-size nuclear program similar to that of Japan. This means that the Islamic Republic will be in a position to manufacture numerous bombs on short order. The ballistic missiles, which are an essential part of any nuclear weapons program, will be excluded from the deal. And previous Iranian experiments with the military dimension of nuclear energy are postponed from scrutiny. Thus, any verification regime will not be informed by the history of Iran\u2019s clandestine program. ", " The proponents of this deal have to account for why they are not bothered by such a large residual enrichment capacity. Why do they think a sunset clause is a wise idea? Why do they believe ballistic missiles should be ignored and how can once craft an intrusive verification system that has no historical memory? An arms control agreement has to be justified first and foremost on technical grounds and whether it meets the essential non-proliferation standards. ", " The path that the proponents of this accord have chosen is to avoid such questions and take refuge in the world of ominous alternatives. One of their favorite talking points is to suggest that coercion has not forestalled Iran\u2019s nuclear path and that since 2003 as sanctions were imposed Iran has gone from 200 to 19,000 centrifuges. They neglect to mention that only approximately 9,500 of those machines are operational. Thus, during this period Iran increased its capacity by an average of 800 centrifuges a year. Although this is hardly ideal it is not an unmanageable situation. The notion that without this agreement Iran would immediately surge to a bomb is belied by the evidence that the proponents of this accord present. ", " Beyond that what is often missed is that Iran\u2019s ingenious strategy is to advance its program incrementally and not provocatively. Iran has always been cautious to step and not leap forward. This way as Iran\u2019s program inches forward, the international community routinely accedes to its new gains. In absence of an agreement, Iran will certainly take measures to advance its program, but those moves are likely to be cautious and incremental so to avoid a military reaction. ", " It is often suggested that should there be breakdown in the talks, the sanctions regime will collapse. The European states and Asian powers will rush back into Iran in defiance of American prohibitions. This notion ignores the fact that U.S. sanctions are secondary in nature, meaning that if there is European bank or an Asian firm that wishes to invest in Iran then it will lose its access to the U.S. market. There is no way that such firms will risk losing access to a U.S. economy estimated at $16.8 trillion dollars for sake of an Iranian economy of $368 billion. To be frank, the U.S. sanctions can succeed even if there is a perception that they are unfair. That is one of the advantages of being a superpower with the largest economy in the world. ", " None of this means the Iran deal is beyond repair. In the next three months, Secretary of State John Kerry has an opportunity to craft an agreement that addresses some of the deficiencies of the framework accord. He may wish to reconsider the wisdom of such a shortened sunset clause. The need for Iran to come clean on all its previous attempts at nuclear weaponization is critical if the agreement is to have a reliable inspection regime. And the ballistic missiles that are already part of UN resolutions should be addressed as part of this agreement and not separately. Finally, there has to be a mechanism in place for how to deal with Iranian violations. The history of arms control suggests that violations are rarely prosecuted and reversed in a timely manner. ", " Should he do so, he would have forged a deal that reliably restrains Iran\u2019s nuclear appetite, enjoys bipartisan support at home and is embraced by our allies in the region. And that agreement would be worthy of the appellation historic.

", " The official tweet announcing Clinton\u2019s candidacy came just before 3:30 p.m. Sunday, and by 4:15 p.m., national campaign surrogates were on a call organized by campaign communications chief Jennifer Palmieri. At 5 p.m., Democratic members of Congress had their own discussion with campaign chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook and political director Amanda Renteria. ", " That conversation lasted less than 30 minutes and didn\u2019t get far beyond making it clear that Clinton intended to work with the elected officials to win the nomination and presidency. ", " \u201cIt was just to let members of Congress know that the campaign is not taking a single vote for granted, and that she\u2019s going to wage a robust campaign in every district, and she wanted to earn our support,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who was happy to see the outreach. ", " \u201cThey just talked about [how] the first phase would be the ramp-up period and would be different from most other campaigns, and how it will focus on small events, direct conversations between Hillary and voters\u201d added Israel, describing details that had already been made public. \u201cAnd in May there will be a large event.\u201d ", " A series of other conversations, including with congressional staffers and state party officials, followed, as the campaign sought to loop in countless Democrats who have felt left out of the Clinton orbit while the former secretary of state approached her announcement over the past two years. Listeners on some calls heard that all of Clinton\u2019s regional political directors are in place and that her political team will be in Washington next week. ", " And while Clinton is working to promote a \u201csmall ball\u201d image with her van ride through the Midwest, her top campaign aide and allies are set to schmooze with major liberal donors this week at the annual spring conference of the Democracy Alliance funders club in San Francisco, according to an agenda obtained by POLITICO. ", " Clinton herself turned down an invitation to speak, but she may record a video greeting to the club, whose donors have had a fraught relationship with Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and have pined for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or another liberal alternative. ", " Podesta is slated to attend, while Clinton\u2019s former policy director Neera Tanden and ally David Brock will speak on a dinner panel Wednesday. Brock, the founder of pro-Clinton groups Media Matters and American Bridge, was also scheduled to speak on a panel Monday about how rich liberals can combat the big spending of the conservative billionaire Koch brothers, whose donor network intends to spend nearly $900 million in the run-up to 2016. ", " Meanwhile, back at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, Clinton\u2019s finance team has been working the phones to pick up the major donors it will need to fund an enterprise that might cost more than $2 billion.

", " \u201cI think that will come in dribbles,\u201d he said. ", " That tracks closely with the wooing of early-state activists who have yet to fully feel the love from Team Clinton. ", " After months of grousing about the lack of outreach from Clinton\u2019s forces, several top New Hampshire officials said they received calls from the Clinton team on Sunday before the announcement, and Iowans also reported getting their first calls from campaign operatives. Activists in South Carolina, the third early-voting state, said they expected to hear from Clinton\u2019s team soon. ", " Clinton staffers held separate calls for activists \u2014 including some who are not yet committed to Clinton \u2014 in the separate early states. A roughly 10-minute New Hampshire call, for example, featured Mook and Mike Vlacich, Clinton\u2019s top aide in the state.

", " But the \u201cwe care about you\u201d approach has only gone so far, as Meyer said it was clear there were still kinks to be worked out in the Iowa organization.

The IAEA also had a role in accounting for the extensive nuclear aspects of Saddam\u2019s programs. This was a case of coercive disarmament as distinct from an arms control agreement like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

The resolutions empowering the inspections were passed under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. The key resolution, UNSCR 687, was a ceasefire resolution. If the Security Council found Iraq in material breech of its provisions, i.e. if Saddam did not comply with the inspectors, military actions could resume. On a few occasions over the ensuing years, some bombing strikes occurred. ", " And yet, with all of these authorities and tools, we were unable to complete the tasks given by the Security Council. UNSCOM and the IAEA after more than seven years of operations inside Iraq could not verify that Saddam had completely disarmed. Ironically, we later learned, Saddam had, eventually, pretty much given up his WMD program by 1997-98. But we could not verify his claims, and by that time no one was giving him the benefit of the doubt Moreover, as he told us in debriefings, he retained the intent to restart the programs once conditions permitted. It would be interesting to ask Saddam if he thought the IAEA inspectors given the intrusive access we had in Iraq, would be sufficient to detect and deter Iranian cheating. ", " Does anyone believe such access will be agreed, voluntarily, by Tehran? ", " In practice, Saddam regularly obstructed and delayed inspectors. He tested, from the start, the will of the Security Council. He cooperated only when he had no other option. And the only reason he cooperated at all, was to get out of sanctions. Saddam pursued two tracks\u2014one of grudging incremental revelations about WMD and the second track was the divide the Security Council and cause sanctions to erode.

As time goes on the objectives and priorities of fifteen nations will evolve and diverge. Saddam recognized and accelerated this trend.

Tehran will be left with 6,104 centrifuges, lower than some reported offers by the U.S., and 5,060 of those can be used to enrich uranium.

Iran will not be required to close the facility but could use it only for research that does not include the enrichment of uranium.

The inspections would continue even after many elements of the deal have expired in 2025, including surveillance of Iran\u2019s centrifuge rotors until 2035. Iran has also agreed to some indefinite transparency measures.

(Obama can temporarily suspend sanctions passed by Congress, although only Congress can permanently repeal them.) The United Nations will also lift its sanctions on Iran after it meets the deal\u2019s requirements.

Once IAEA inspectors certify that Iran has met those conditions, Kerry said, sanctions will begin to be reduced. ", " The deal, key points of which were sent out to reporters by the White House, was unclear on some crucial questions that critics are sure to pounce on: ", " \u2014 Although the agreement specifies that Iran will dramatically \u201creduce\u201d its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 97 percent, from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms, details of the agreement provided by the Obama administration do not say how that will happen. U.S. officials are expected to require Iran to ship that material \u2014 which is more than halfway to the potency needed for a bomb \u2014 out of the country. But Iran has proposed to retain the material and simply dilute it to a form unsuitable for a nuclear weapon, although that dilution is reversible. ", " Kerry, however, said in Lausanne that negotiators have a resolution on what to do with Iran\u2019s uranium: \u201cIt has to be either diluted or sold on the international market, one of the two. \u2026 That is agreed upon at this point in time,\u201d he said. ", " \u2014 Iran has refused to answer a list of IAEA questions about its suspected past research into nuclear weapons technology, like explosives that can detonate highly enriched uranium. The agreement does not specify how or when that will happen, saying only that \u201cIran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA\u2019s concerns\u201d on the military research question. Mogherini said only that the nuclear agency \u201cwill have enhanced access through agreed procedures, including to clarify past and present issues.\u201d ", " Oil-rich Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for scientific, medical and other purposes, not for making weapons. On Thursday, Zarif said Iran has agreed to take steps to assure the world \u201cthat our program is exclusively peaceful, that our program always has been and always will be exclusively peaceful.\u201d But, he added, Iran will not close any of its nuclear facilities \u2014 a condition it said would have been unacceptable. \u201cWe have done significant work. We have made achievements. We have made progress,\u201d Zarif said. ", " Obama stressed in particular the inspection and verification aspects of the agreement. ", " \u201cIf Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see anything suspicious, we will inspect it,\u201d Obama said. He said Iran will face \u201cmore inspections than any other country in the world.\u201d And he said the relief from sanctions will be \u201cphased\u201d as long as Iran proves it is complying with the terms of an agreement. ", " \u201cIf there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be no deal.\u201d ", " Kerry contended that the deal has no sunset date. In reality, most of its provisions \u2014 how many centrifuges Iran can run, for instance \u2014 will expire after a decade. But Iran has agreed to a special arrangement with the IAEA known as the Additional Protocol, which grants the international agency\u2019s inspectors enhanced information about and access to the country\u2019s nuclear activities and infrastructure. The Additional Protocol has no time limit. ", " The deal\u2019s announcement came after a final round of negotiations in Lausanne, following a grueling marathon session that kept officials talking until 6 a.m. Thursday \u2014 and two days after a self-imposed deadline to reach a political agreement. Aside from the U.S. and Iran, countries participating include Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China.

I am thankful that America gave the world the best 70 years it has ever had: 1945-2015. Despite the mistakes in Vietnam, in Iraq and in other places, the post-Nagasaki Pax Americana has given more humans more peace more prosperity and more liberty that at any other time in history.

If Iran goes nuclear, Israel will have to change its responsible and restrained nuclear policy. If Iran goes nuclear, the Middle East will become a multi-player nuclear arena, that no one can manage and no one can control. Worried about ISIS? Anxious about Al Qaeda? Shocked by the carnage in Syria? Imagine what will happen when the most unstable region in the world becomes nuclearized. One outcome will be even more extremism. A second outcome will be unceasing conventional wars. A third outcome will be the proliferation of nuclear capabilities in the hands of non- state players that will use them, sooner or later, to catastrophic results. The overall outcome will be a strategic nightmare that will first disrupt the everyday life of Tel Aviv and Riyadh, then Paris and London and finally New York and Chicago.

Neither Tehran nor the United States and its allies want to blink first, and neither side wants to be the first to leave the table. And both sides want to be very clear: If there\u2019s a stalemate, it\u2019s the other side\u2019s fault. ", " They\u2019re not just trying to avoid political embarrassment at home. For both the United States and Iran, a perception that they caused the breakdown could put them in a worse position on the world stage than they were in before the talks started 18 months ago. ", "Story Continued Below", " The talks resumed in Lausanne, Switzerland Thursday after a grueling late night session, in which Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterparts met until 6 a.m. local time \u2014 and then broke with little to show for it. ", " The extension is proof that the United States is giving Iran every last chance to show it\u2019s serious, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ", " \u201cWhat is clear is that Iran now, and over the course of talks that have lasted over a year, has had every opportunity to make the kinds of commitments that the international community expects,\u201d Earnest said, explaining why emissaries from the United States and aligned powers \u2014 France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China \u2014 haven\u2019t walked away from the meetings. ", " If those discussions do end short of a deal, Earnest added, \u201cthe international community would understandably hold Iran responsible for that shortcoming.\u201d ", " But Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the problem is on the other side \u2014 or sides. ", " \u201cWe are facing six countries who have different positions and interests among each other and with Iran,\u201d he told the semi-official Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency on Wednesday. \u201cAgreement even among the P5+1 nations is difficult, but what\u2019s important is that they know that the people of Iran and their representatives at these talks will not submit to unreasonable demands. This is an exceptional opportunity for them to correct their past behavior toward the people of Iran, but only if they recognize the value of this chance.\u201d ", " If the talks falter, proving that the other party is at fault would be crucial for both, and not just for the sake of internal politics in their respective countries. The United States would want to dump more sanctions on Iran, but that would be harder if it looked like the Americans abandoned the talks arbitrarily. And the Iranians would seek ways to diminish the decades of crippling sanctions without looking like an intransigent nuclear menace. ", " \u201cBoth sides will blame the other\u201d if talks founder, said Gary Samore, an arms control expert who advised President Barack Obama on weapons of mass destruction issues. ", " But in reality, he added, \u201cneither side is to blame. The impasse reflects deep-seated differences of national interest. Iran wants the U.N. resolutions overturned upfront so that Iran is no longer a target of international pressure. We want to keep the resolutions in place to hold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire.\u201d ", " For the White House, it\u2019s not just a matter of putting the responsibility on the Iranians \u2014 it\u2019s also important to make sure no one pins the blame on the United States. ", " Earnest spoke directly to that issue in explaining why the White House wanted Congress to avoid placing additional obstacles to a deal: \u201cIf the United States could be blamed for the talks falling apart, then it would be hard to preserve international unity around the imposition of sanctions.\u201d ", " But at this point, he said, Iran has had plenty of time, and \u201cthe United States and the international community is prepared to walk away\u201d if it becomes clear that talks have stalled. ", " \u201cWe do not envision a scenario where we would abruptly and arbitrarily end the talks that are productive,\u201d but \u201cat the same time, these conversations are not open-ended,\u201d Earnest told reporters. He said Iran has to agree to two key commitments: \u201cshut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon\u201d and \u201ccomply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that they\u2019re living up to the agreement.\u201d ", " If the United States did decide to walk away from the talks, Earnest said, \u201cwe of course would do that in coordination with the international community.\u201d ", " Earlier Wednesday, the Iranians, who have insisted that all sanctions be lifted immediately, did hint at some flexibility. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained his line that \u201cwe cannot have an agreement that does not include sanctions relief. They must be lifted,\u201d according to a translation of his comments to the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency. ", " But, he added, \u201cthe type and origin of the sanctions vary and must be dealt with individually and we are insisting in the first step of the agreement all of the economic and banking and oil sanctions be lifted and sanctions that are related to other areas be put under a clear framework\u201d for removal. ", " Even if the parties successfully draft a broad political statement, the painstaking work of crafting a detailed technical plan would still need to be done before the harder deadline of June 30, when the current agreement with Iran would expire. It\u2019s also unclear whether the White House would be able to convince skeptical members of Congress \u2014 and the American public \u2014 that the plan is adequate to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. ", " Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the most vocal opponents of making any deal with Iran, continued to blast the process on Wednesday. ", " \u201cThe concessions offered to Iran in Lausanne would ensure a bad deal that would endanger Israel, the Middle East and the peace of the world,\u201d Netanyahu ", " ahead of a visit to Jerusalem from House Speaker John Boehner. U.S. lawmakers have pledged to pass legislation that would require their approval of any Iran deal when they return from recess on April 13. ", " \u201cNow is the time for the international community to insist on a better deal,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cA better deal would significantly roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure. A better deal would link the lifting of the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs to a change in Iran\u2019s behavior.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Four years of global diplomacy and hundreds of hours in the White House Situation Room would silence questions about her credentials.

From Europe to the Middle East to Asia, countries Clinton once cast as foreign policy successes are now crisis spots, and public opinion toward Obama\u2019s overall foreign policy performance has turned sharply negative.

Some say it signaled a lack of commitment to the Middle East, and they note that China continues aggressive policies in the region. ", " Clinton engineered a 2011 diplomatic breakthrough with long-isolated Myanmar, but political reform in the country has stalled. ", " Perhaps worst of all is Libya, where Clinton played a central role in arguing for the 2011 bombing campaign that toppled the regime of Muammar Qadhafi. The country has since slid into chaos, and most Americans now understand it through the lens of Benghazi.

A final deal that wins over the American public \u2014 and which doesn\u2019t collapse \u2014 could become a crucial bragging point for Clinton, who helped to initiate the talks.

", " That weak hand has some observers wondering if Clinton will try to create distance between herself and Obama, perhaps by arguing that she disagreed with key policy decisions during her State Department tenure. ", " She hinted at that strategy in an August interview with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, when she lamented the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to build up a stronger moderate rebel force in Syria, an approach she had backed in 2012. Clinton also said that Obama\u2019s foreign policy lacks an \u201corganizing principle.\u201d ", " The interview caused a sensation that angered Obama officials and loyalists, prompting Clinton to place an apologetic phone call to Obama. Clinton advisers denied that she was consciously trying to create political daylight with Obama and noted that her recently released memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d spoke glowingly of the president.

He has pressed the administration to provide detailed briefings \u2014 not just perfunctory phone calls \u2014 prior to a change in policy.

On Obama\u2019s inauguration day in 2009, White House adviser Greg Craig told a group of congressional leaders that the president planned to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay without the consent of Congress. With Democrats in control of the House, Boehner used the appropriations process to ensure that never happened. (Craig did not reply to an email seeking comment.)

", " Now, over the next few months, Boehner will have an opportunity to continue to have an outsized impact on foreign policy. The Obama administration is seeking a resolution explicitly authorizing military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In meetings and conversations, Boehner personally pushed Obama to send a proposal to Capitol Hill, but he is now skeptical it will come together. ", " \u201cIf I see a strategy that I think can work, then you can write an [Authorization for Use of Military Force] that supports it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the president asks for less authority than he has today, you begin to scratch your head. And, secondly, I think they\u2019re looking at this entire problem with blinders on. They need to take a broader view of a bigger strategy to deal with these growing problems.\u201d ", " With parts of Iraq falling to ISIL, Boehner said he told Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that allowing Iranian soldiers to help patrol Tikrit was an \u201cembarrassment to our country.\u201d He said the U.S. should consider repurposing troops to help the Iraqi army fight more efficiently. ", " \u201cWe have nearly 4,000 troops there today,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cAnd they are mostly advising and training. But I think, frankly, if we had some of those people out in the field helping to direct, it would help the Iraqi forces in a big way. So those are boots on the ground, but we\u2019re not talking about sending 100,000 people in there.\u201d ", " While most people are fixated on a rift between America and Israel, Boehner used his time here to downplay it. He strode to a podium with Netanyahu here, and, in brief remarks, Boehner said \u201cwhile we may have political disagreements from time to time,\u201d the two nations share a strong bond. ", " During his visit, Boehner traveled with the Israeli Defense Forces to see the \u201cterror tunnels\u201d near Gaza. He ate lunch with Netanyahu and met with the U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro and the staff at the American consulate in Jerusalem. He also spent time with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon in the brand new Waldorf Astoria, located around the corner from the U.S. Consulate.

Neither Tehran nor the United States and its allies want to blink first, and neither side wants to be the first to leave the table.

For both the United States and Iran, a perception that they caused the breakdown could put them in a worse position on the world stage than they were in before the talks started 18 months ago.

", " The extension is proof that the United States is giving Iran every last chance to show it\u2019s serious, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ", " \u201cWhat is clear is that Iran now, and over the course of talks that have lasted over a year, has had every opportunity to make the kinds of commitments that the international community expects,\u201d Earnest said, explaining why emissaries from the United States and aligned powers \u2014 France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China \u2014 haven\u2019t walked away from the meetings. ", " If those discussions do end short of a deal, Earnest added, \u201cthe international community would understandably hold Iran responsible for that shortcoming.\u201d ", " But Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the problem is on the other side \u2014 or sides. ", " \u201cWe are facing six countries who have different positions and interests among each other and with Iran,\u201d he told the semi-official Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency on Wednesday. \u201cAgreement even among the P5+1 nations is difficult, but what\u2019s important is that they know that the people of Iran and their representatives at these talks will not submit to unreasonable demands. This is an exceptional opportunity for them to correct their past behavior toward the people of Iran, but only if they recognize the value of this chance.\u201d ", " If the talks falter, proving that the other party is at fault would be crucial for both, and not just for the sake of internal politics in their respective countries. The United States would want to dump more sanctions on Iran, but that would be harder if it looked like the Americans abandoned the talks arbitrarily. And the Iranians would seek ways to diminish the decades of crippling sanctions without looking like an intransigent nuclear menace. ", " \u201cBoth sides will blame the other\u201d if talks founder, said Gary Samore, an arms control expert who advised President Barack Obama on weapons of mass destruction issues. ", " But in reality, he added, \u201cneither side is to blame. The impasse reflects deep-seated differences of national interest. Iran wants the U.N. resolutions overturned upfront so that Iran is no longer a target of international pressure. We want to keep the resolutions in place to hold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire.\u201d ", "DENNIS ROSS", " For the White House, it\u2019s not just a matter of putting the responsibility on the Iranians \u2014 it\u2019s also important to make sure no one pins the blame on the United States. ", " Earnest spoke directly to that issue in explaining why the White House wanted Congress to avoid placing additional obstacles to a deal: \u201cIf the United States could be blamed for the talks falling apart, then it would be hard to preserve international unity around the imposition of sanctions.\u201d ", " But at this point, he said, Iran has had plenty of time, and \u201cthe United States and the international community is prepared to walk away\u201d if it becomes clear that talks have stalled. ", " \u201cWe do not envision a scenario where we would abruptly and arbitrarily end the talks that are productive,\u201d but \u201cat the same time, these conversations are not open-ended,\u201d Earnest told reporters. He said Iran has to agree to two key commitments: \u201cshut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon\u201d and \u201ccomply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that they\u2019re living up to the agreement.\u201d ", " If the United States did decide to walk away from the talks, Earnest said, \u201cwe of course would do that in coordination with the international community.\u201d ", " Earlier Wednesday, the Iranians, who have insisted that all sanctions be lifted immediately, did hint at some flexibility. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained his line that \u201cwe cannot have an agreement that does not include sanctions relief. They must be lifted,\u201d according to a translation of his comments to the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency. ", " But, he added, \u201cthe type and origin of the sanctions vary and must be dealt with individually and we are insisting in the first step of the agreement all of the economic and banking and oil sanctions be lifted and sanctions that are related to other areas be put under a clear framework\u201d for removal. ", " Even if the parties successfully draft a broad political statement, the painstaking work of crafting a detailed technical plan would still need to be done before the harder deadline of June 30, when the current agreement with Iran would expire. It\u2019s also unclear whether the White House would be able to convince skeptical members of Congress \u2014 and the American public \u2014 that the plan is adequate to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. ", " Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the most vocal opponents of making any deal with Iran, continued to blast the process on Wednesday. ", " \u201cThe concessions offered to Iran in Lausanne would ensure a bad deal that would endanger Israel, the Middle East and the peace of the world,\u201d Netanyahu ", " ahead of a visit to Jerusalem from House Speaker John Boehner. U.S. lawmakers have pledged to pass legislation that would require their approval of any Iran deal when they return from recess on April 13. ", " \u201cNow is the time for the international community to insist on a better deal,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cA better deal would significantly roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure.

But there\u2019s another one: None of her potential challengers appear to have the will and/or the ability to beat her. ", " Still, as Clinton prepares to announce her campaign on Sunday, there\u2019s a pervasive feeling among unaligned Democrats and Clinton loyalists alike that at least one of the possible challengers will take the plunge and creep up to 20 or 25 percent in the polls \u2014 enough to give her a scare. It\u2019s still a waiting game, though, because there\u2019s no such consensus on a few critical questions. ", " Namely: who, when and how. ", " Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, former Virginia senator Jim Webb, and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 the trio who have shown the greatest interest in mounting a challenge to Clinton \u2014 face a steep path, Democratic operatives say, while the two most famous names mentioned as potential challengers \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 seem increasingly far from running. ", " Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor, emerged in the last few days to stake a possible claim to be the Clinton alternative, raising Warren-like concerns about Clinton\u2019s closeness to Wall Street. But he\u2019s a maverick whose shift from Republican to independent to Democrat is unlikely to excite the progressive base. ", " Nonetheless, the array of party operatives, Clinton allies, and former Democratic presidential candidates who spoke with POLITICO described a path for any of the would-be challengers similar to the ones O\u2019Malley and Chafee are trying to blaze: Distinguish themselves from Clinton on a series of policy points, mostly by running to her left \u2014 and then, simply due to the structure of the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus, one of them would likely approach a 30 percent showing. But nearly every figure also cautioned that, given Clinton\u2019s lead in polls and in organizing throughout the country, the path forward for any other candidate would be treacherous. ", " Nonetheless, the situation on the ground does not mirror 2007, when Clinton was overtaken by a rush of support and money that flowed to the upstart Barack Obama. By mid-April 2007, both Clinton and Barack Obama were both polling in the 20-to-40 percent range nationally. ", " \u201cIt would take a formidable, inspirational candidate\u201d to seriously challenge Clinton now, says Richardson, who himself was at around 3 percent in April 2007, and who added that O\u2019Malley has emailed him to talk about foreign policy. \u201cI think while O\u2019Malley is developing as a good candidate, I don\u2019t see the mix for a dramatic alternative there.\u201d ", " That\u2019s largely because Richardson\u2019s 3 percent in 2007 is roughly three times higher than O\u2019Malley\u2019s 1 percent in the RealClearPolitics ", " through March of this year. That leaves him alongside Webb\u2019s 1 percent and behind Sanders\u2019s 4 percent. Clinton\u2019s 60 is trailed by Biden\u2019s and Warren\u2019s 12 percent, despite the former\u2019s lack of political organization and the latter\u2019s repeated insistence that she will not run. The numbers are similar in ", " and ", " ", ", the first two states to vote in the primary contest. ", " Nonetheless, Clinton aides point to O\u2019Malley as the most viable alternative candidate, believing he will eventually pick up support from many of the liberal activists currently urging Warren to run. The silver lining in his low name recognition is that he has an opportunity to introduce himself to the American people on his own terms. ", " Warren, meanwhile, repeatedly insists she will not throw her hat in the ring despite an organized campaign put together by progressive groups intended to draft the bank antagonist. ", " And even though the vice president has run for president twice before \u2014 including against Clinton and Obama in 2008 \u2014 he has ", " to speak of. Biden\u2019s supporters insist that he would need little preparation to jump in due to his existing networks and the goodwill generated by his trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina earlier this year. But he shows no signs of seriously considering a run. ", " The biggest opportunity for a Clinton alternative would likely come in Iowa, the site of her 2008 undoing, because the caucus system there is friendly enough to protest candidates that someone else, or a group of others, will almost certainly garner at least one-quarter of the vote. Even Iowa\u2019s sitting senator, Tom Harkin, won just 76 percent when he ran in 1992, despite the fact that none of his rival candidates, including Bill Clinton, bothered to contest the caucuses. ", " But even a relatively promising showing in Iowa could be a one-off if it doesn\u2019t generate momentum for a challenger heading into New Hampshire. And, for Clinton, \u201cit\u2019s kind of a luxury in a campaign when you\u2019re worried about only getting 75 percent of the vote,\u201d notes Shrum. ", " and ", " One person who disagrees with the idea that challenging Clinton is a hopeless task is former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who vaulted from single digits in the polls to mount a serious challenge against the far better-known and better-funded Walter Mondale in 1984. ", " \u201cI also discount the polls a great deal,\u201d says Hart, who is personally close with O\u2019Malley and a past email correspondent with Webb. \u201cAt this moment, and for a time period, they are name recognition functions and less matters of preference.\u201d ", " O\u2019Malley, for one, has been trying to boost his name recognition as he preps for a likely run. ", " He and Webb are expected to appear at South Carolina\u2019s Clyburn Fish Fry on April 24 \u2014 an annual event hosted by Rep. Jim Clyburn that frequently draws presidential hopefuls to the early voting state \u2014 and the state party\u2019s convention the next day. Clinton is not currently scheduled to appear, but may do so after formally announcing her candidacy. ", " It\u2019s a reflection of a long-established pattern: O\u2019Malley has been by far the most aggressive candidate in terms of early state organizing, while Webb has been slow to schedule events and Clinton has let others represent her. Sanders, meanwhile, has appeared in early states but also spent considerable time elsewhere \u2014 most recently a political trip with stops in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Austin, and Chicago. The groups supporting a Warren candidacy have also been organizing voters in the early states, but absent a candidate, they have largely focused on shifting the overall conversation to the left. ", " The four likeliest contenders \u2014 O\u2019Malley, Webb, Sanders, and Chafee \u2014 occupy vastly different lanes within the party, in terms of ideology, experience, and preparation for 2016. ", " O\u2019Malley saw his 2016 chances flicker when his expected successor lost his 2014 run for governor, in what was seen by some as a referendum on the outgoing governor. He says he will decide whether to run for president sometime this spring. But he has already pulled together a team of operatives that includes Bill Hyers, the campaign manager for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. ", " This year, he has already stopped by at least four events in each of Iowa and New Hampshire, and one in South Carolina. He also recently hired a new press secretary with New Hampshire experience. ", " Meanwhile Webb, a one-term senator and former Secretary of the Navy under Republican President Ronald Reagan, has been more deliberate. After announcing his exploratory committee in November, Webb has largely kept out of the public eye. But he recently traveled to Iowa and has hired a state campaign director. ", " Sanders, a self-described socialist who often rails against billionaires and appears frequently on television, initially suggested he would decide whether to run in March. But he ", " that he would likely push off a decision because of his work as the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. His spokesman now says he will make a decision \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d ", " Chafee has been the most eager to take on Clinton, though his bid would be regarded as an even longer shot after he declined to seek re-election for governor in 2014 when it became clear he would face a tough Democratic primary. ", " Indeed, none of these candidates will have the benefit of anything approaching the widespread Clinton network, which was largely represented by the independent political action committee Ready For Hillary that signed up nearly 4 million voters over the last two-plus years. ", " In the face of such organizing, the non-Clinton candidates seemed so daunted that none of them seized the moment in March when Clinton was revealed to have used a private email system as secretary of state. ", " Former candidates and advisers say the best approach would be to chip away at Clinton on a few policies \u2014 like Wall Street regulation \u2014 as a way to start to gain traction. ", " \u201cIf the policies [Clinton] comes out with are all-inclusive, then a primary is not necessary,\u201d said Reverend Al Sharpton, who ran in 2004. But \u201cif they\u2019re just running and there\u2019s no policy debate, it\u2019s just a vanity exercise.\u201d ", " O\u2019Malley has said the presidency should not be \u201cpassed between two families\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Clintons and the Bushes \u2014 and has begun tailoring his rhetoric on Wall Street policy to Clinton\u2019s left, though he has not attacked her by name. ", " Webb is taking a different tack, suggesting he is, in the words Rania Batrice, his Iowa state director, an outsider who is well-positioned to take on the Democratic Party\u2019s most famous name. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that Iowans and the rest of the country are tired of the \u2018same ol\u2019, same ol\u201d rhetoric when it comes to today\u2019s political atmosphere,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for someone different, someone who will put people ahead of politics. That is Jim Webb.\u201d ", " and ", " But neither Webb nor Sanders can realistically claim that they are fresh faces. At 69 and 73, respectively, each is older than the 67-year-old Clinton.

Now, with the launch of her campaign just around the corner, political strategists say the candidate and her team are set to wrest control of the narrative and go on offense.", "\u201cPolitics, especially political reporters, abhor a vacuum, so media outlets are going to hunt and peck for stories that create the dynamic of the campaign being a yet-unannounced HRC presidential vs. the august members of the Fourth Estate,\u201d Chris Lehane, the Democratic communications strategist and Clinton White House alum, told POLITICO. \u201cOnce the campaign is off and running like Usain Bolt, based on the big idea she offers as her rationale, it will develop specific reporters and outlets that take a franchise interest.\u201d", "The current state of Clinton-press relations reflects \u201cthe natural lay of things. She\u2019s not a candidate, there\u2019s not an affirmative message yet, and there\u2019s not yet an apparatus fully capable of combatting [these stories],\u201d said Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesperson. Merrill confirmed that the Clinton team had media outreach plans in the works, but said he was not in a position to discuss them.", "Being able to go on the offensive is especially important for a candidate like Clinton, who has few sympathizers in the media. Supporters have long grumbled that the Times and its mainstream brethren are especially tough on Clinton \u2014 the newspaper\u2019s executive editor Dean Baquet calls the coverage \u201caggressive and fair\u201d \u2014 but the past six weeks have only increased their fears. Meanwhile, right-wing media outlets have been using the new revelations to relentlessly attack her, while left-wing publications have been busy pushing their own populist alternatives.", "The trifecta of right-wing attacks, left-wing angst and mainstream scrutiny has already made for a far rockier campaign rollout than Clinton likely anticipated. Though a mid-March CNN/ORC poll had her beating every potential Republican challenger by double digits, a new Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that her support has been \u201cwilting\u201d in the key battleground states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. In each state, a majority of those surveyed said that Clinton\u2019s private email use was either \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201csomewhat important\u201d to their vote in 2016, and well more than a third of voters in each state said the issue made them less likely to vote for Clinton.", "While the formal launch of a campaign will allow Clinton to take some control into her own hands, the absence of a viable primary challenger could pose its own problems, strategists said. With no real competitor, the media will be all the more eager to assume an antagonistic role.", "\u201cIn the absence of a primary opponent, the press may feel obliged to fill that role, giving her the scrutiny and vetting normally provided by an opponent,\u201d Paul Begala, the political consultant and chief strategist for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, said. \u201cIf so, there is not much Hillary can do about it, nor should she try.\u201d", " ", " \u00a9 2019 POLITICO LLC"]},

We are open to a diverse range of views: When we disagree, it\u2019s never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it \u2014 together.\u201d ", " Mook also clearly states the campaign\u2019s most simple purpose, which could give a hint of how Clinton will frame her own goals while reintroducing herself to Americans. The campaign\u2019s goal is \u201cto give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States.

But the dual storms are dragging on her reputation and ensuring the former first lady and senator\u2019s place as the favored target of Republican presidential contenders who might otherwise be criticizing each other. The scrutiny has resurrected the gamut of scandals that plagued the Clintons during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency in the 1990s and given new ammunition to Republican critics looking to paint the Democratic front-runner as untrustworthy and opaque. Even Clinton\u2019s tenure at the State Department \u2014 once regarded by Democrats as an unalloyed positive \u2014 is getting a second and third look. \n ", " ", " Clinton allies and aides forcefully deny any implications of inappropriate behavior, noting that Clinton was following precedent in Foggy Bottom and that she has asked the State Department to review and release her emails. Furthermore, many say, these issues won\u2019t sway any undecided voters 20 months down the road, when Clinton \u2014 as well-known a figure as any \u2014 is first expected to face a competitive vote. \n ", " ", " Still, the fact remains that Clinton is not controlling the national discussion in the final weeks of her pre-campaign phase. Clinton\u2019s news conference came directly after a speech to the United Nations on the progress made by women and girls around the globe, and one day after she unveiled a much-anticipated report on the same topic. She is expected to focus on the historic nature of her potential status as the first female president as she runs in 2016, and much of her March schedule has been dedicated to highlighting her work on gender equality and women\u2019s rights. \n ", " ", " Reports surfaced last week in The New York Times that Clinton relied exclusively on a private email address during her four years as secretary of state, rather than an official account where the messages would likely have become part of her agency\u2019s historical records. The Associated Press later reported that the emails were channeled through a private server registered to her New York residence. \n ", " ", " Meanwhile, the White House acknowledged Monday that Obama traded emails with Clinton on her private account but said he was unaware how the account was set up or that messages were not being saved in a federal archive. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,\u201d said press secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cI would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.\u201d \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Hillary Clinton will kick off her long-anticipated campaign for president on Sunday with a social-media announcement, three sources close to the campaign-to-be told POLITICO, and will begin her 2016 run for the presidency with a trip to Iowa. \n ", " ", " The announcement will be followed by a round of conference calls with staff, supporters and potential campaign donors to outline the theme of the campaign, which will focus on middle-class pocketbook economics and her role as a gender trailblazer, one of the people said. The timing of the rollout, which has leaked out to reporters over the last few days, has been the subject of hot debate inside the growing Clinton organization, and several sources have told POLITICO the Sunday launch isn\u2019t intended to cast her as competition to Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is announcing his own candidacy on Monday. \n ", " ", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cWe just wanted to get this thing over with and get on with it,\u201d a soon-to-be-Clinton staffer said on condition of anonymity. A senior campaign staffer refused to confirm or deny previously published reports that Clinton was throwing her hat in the ring, and her official spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. \n ", " ", " As POLITICO reported last month, the former secretary of state plans a quick tour of at least two battleground states, Iowa and New Hampshire, before settling into her new campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to begin the months-long work of setting up a field operation, communications shop and fundraising apparatus for a campaign that many close to Clinton estimate will raise and spend $1.5-to-$2 billion. \n ", " ", " Clinton has already filmed her announcement video, in which she will position herself as an alternative to the Republican field expected to include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and possibly Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas who is a favorite among evangelical Christians. \n ", " ", " Clinton has privately told her aides that she wants to avoid the coronation atmosphere of her 2008 launch and is trying to schedule what one person in her orbit described as \u201clow-key\u201d events where she will interact directly with voters \u2014 nearly seven years after her last appearances as a presidential candidate, when she lost to then-Senator Barack Obama. \n ", " ", " Some supporters, though, are skeptical of a digital launch that may do little to soften Clinton\u2019s edges. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she\u2019s not doing an event with kids and families, that would have made more sense to me,\u201d said a supporter with close ties to Clinton. \n ", " ", " The news of the announcement also elicited GOP attacks. The Republican National Committee on Friday tweeted a \u201cStop Hillary\u201d video, saying her \u201ccampaign will launch in the shadow of investigations & questions about her ethics.\u201d \n ", " ", " The optics of the announcement will say much about the campaign to come: In January 2007, Clinton ran \u2013 misguidedly, as it turned out \u2013 on a thematic platform of inevitability and her video message, emailed to supporters, featured her sitting in a power pose at Whitehaven, her mansion in Washington D.C. This time, she is likely to emphasize her connection with middle-class voters, who remain disaffected with the pace of the country\u2019s spotty, slow-motion recovery eight years after the financial collapse and the start of the Great Recession. \n ", " ", " The choice of Iowa is also a window into the candidate\u2019s complex political psyche. Iowa was the beginning of the end of her 2008 candidacy, and her humiliating third-place finish behind Barack Obama and John Edwards set the stage for Obama\u2019s victory. Clinton \u2014 who trashed the Iowa caucus format as undemocratic during her last campaign \u2014 is intent on erasing that loss, and proving to voters in that critical swing state that she\u2019s willing to compete and win there, even if she faces only token opposition. \n ", " ", " \u201cThis is a comeback, she\u2019s going right into what was enemy territory. I think it\u2019s smart,\u201d says David Yepsen, longtime chief political correspondent for the Des Moines Register and now a mass communications professor. \n ", " ", " \u201cShe got creamed there last time, it was a real downer. She had to come back. Now she\u2019ll try again. She\u2019s going to find it\u2019s a real uplift\u2026 [S]he\u2019s better at small events. It will give her a chance to show she\u2019s warm, she\u2019s friendly.\u201d \n ", " ", " Clinton enters the fray as the dominant front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with few potential primary opponents expected to challenge her outside of former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Clinton leads all of them by wide margins in preliminary polling. \n ", " ", " Clinton\u2019s team has emphasized that the 2016 rollout will be a methodical, grassroots affair \u2013 in keeping with Clinton\u2019s I\u2019m-in-no-hurry campaign planning process. For the last several months, a team of policy advisers, overseen by soon-to-be campaign chairman John Podesta have been quietly working on a series of economic proposals that will be rolled out over time. They are expected to closely mirror many of President Obama\u2019s more popular recent reforms to student loans and immigration, a topic Clinton handled gingerly in 2008. \n ", " ", " As POLITICO reported earlier this year, Clinton discussed student loan reform \u2013 a key issue for younger voters Clinton has struggled to win over \u2013 with progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a closed-door meeting two months ago. \n ", " ", " If Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign launch emphasized her electability \u2013 her kick-off slogan was \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it\u201d \u2013 her 2016 is more about likability and her capacity to relate to real Americans after years of mansions, private jets and the damaging disclosure that she operated her own email server instead of using the State Department system as dictated by department rules. \n ", " ", " In a new epilogue to her 2014 memoir posted on the web site of the Huffington Post \u2013 Obama\u2019s favorite outlet in 2008, Clinton emphasized her softer side, something she was loathe to do eight years ago under the advice of pollster Mark Penn who believed voters wouldn\u2019t respond to a female candidate who showed weakness. \n ", " ", " and ", " \u201cI wrote this book over the course of 2013 and early 2014, mostly from a cozy, sun-drenched third-floor study in our home in Chappaqua, New York,\u201d she wrote, wistfully. \u201cThere\u2019s a thick carpet and a comfortable chair, and I can look out through the windows into the treetops.

It could bring the White House into sync with congressional Republicans demanding new sanctions on Tehran. It could road-test Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s theory that more time under sanctions will force a weakened Tehran back to the bargaining table. ", " And as President Barack Obama has warned, it could start the United States down the road toward military action. ", " An agreement in Switzerland would be a big step away from such an outcome, but not a guarantee of success. In recent weeks officials there have shifted from promising an \u201cagreement\u201d to saying they will have an \u201cunderstanding,\u201d and Tuesday\u2019s AP report suggested that key issues remain unresolved.

Both Iran and the United States \u2014 along with its five negotiating partners, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 are reluctant to walk away from the talks, although the United States and Iran have both ruled out an extension beyond a June 30 deadline. ", " Obama officials say that if they conclude a deal cannot be reached, they will embrace the type of additional congressional sanctions the president has spent months promising to veto.

Instead of attacking Senate Republicans for undermining his Iran policy, Obama would be asking for their help. ", " \u201cThis is why the White House and Congress should have a long-overdue adult conversation with the GOP, as well as the many concerned Democrats, about what those sanctions should look like,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ", " That approach would test Netanyahu\u2019s argument that sanctions \u2014 and a crash in oil prices that began to hit crude-exporting Iran last fall \u2014 need more time to force a change in Iran\u2019s bargaining position. ", " During his March 3 address to Congress, Netanyahu insisted that if Iran threatens to leave the talks, \u201c[t]hey\u2019ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.\u201d ", " \u201cAnd by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran,\u201d he added, \u201cyou have the power to make them need it even more.\u201d ", " But top Obama officials have expressed skepticism that more sanctions can persuade Iran to accept strict limits on its nuclear program. ", " In a recent ", " with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser for strategic communication, cast doubt on the potential impact of more sanctions. ", " If the nuclear talks fail, Rhodes said, the United States might bet on \u201cthe notion that Iran is going to completely capitulate under the pressure of economic sanctions.\u201d But that, he said, \u201cdoes not seem likely.\u201d ", " The other option, Rhodes added, is \u201cthe decision to take military action.\u201d ", " Obama has repeatedly said he is willing to use force to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But many observers doubt he would actually use it unless Iran moves from enriching uranium \u2014 ostensibly for peaceful purposes \u2014 to taking explicit steps to weaponize it. ", " That\u2019s why some observers are skeptical that Obama really would welcome new sanctions, even if the talks collapse. ", " \u201cThe most likely answer is more talking,\u201d says Blaise Misztal, director for national security at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ", " Speaking on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on March 22, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said that in the event the talks fall apart, the interim deal \u201ccould continue for some time.\u201d Corker has said there\u2019s no reason to rush to a deal by March 31 when that interim deal remains in effect until the end of June. ", " and ", " The political reality, though, is that there may be less time than that. Congress returns from recess on April 13 and is expected to move quickly afterward on legislation that Obama has warned would drive Iran from the negotiating table. Some observers believe that date matters more to the White House than Tuesday\u2019s deadline. ", " Obama has vowed to veto a bill sponsored by Corker that would require an up-or-down vote on the deal by Congress, and which could prevent Obama from suspending some sanctions on Iran. But support from moderate Democrats could allow for an override of a veto. ", " And that would be a nightmare scenario for Obama: A collapse of the talks in which Iran blames the United States and wins sympathy on the international stage. ", " \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to give Iran an excuse to say it\u2019s the U.S.\u2019s fault that we walked away from the table,\u201d says Mieke Eoyang, director of the national security program at the centrist think tank Third Way. \u201cIran should be the bad guys in this.\u201d ", " As members of both parties gamed out the possible scenarios, some Democrats speculated that Obama could defang relentless GOP attacks on his Iran policies \u2014 which are taking a toll in public opinion polls \u2014 if he were to declare a deal hopeless and call for tougher sanctions on Tehran. ", " Republicans insisted that they would come out ahead either way. ", " \u201cThe fate of the Iran talks will not likely alter their core message on Iran,\u201d said one former foreign policy adviser to a 2012 Republican presidential candidate whose current employer doesn\u2019t allow him to speak for the record. ", " Deal or not, this person said that Republicans will drive a message that Obama\u2019s \u201cpliant strategy completely failed to secure a strong agreement and will have left Iran that much closer to a nuclear weapons capability.\u201d ", " Meanwhile, U.S. officials in Lausanne, Switzerland, pushed back against the idea that the talks were headed for a dead end. ", " The 15-member U.S. delegation there is led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and includes technical experts from the State, Energy and Treasury departments who are advising on nuclear issues and sanctions. They include Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of state for Political Affairs; Robert Malley, an Iran expert at the National Security Council; James Timbie, an arms control adviser at the State Department; and Paul Irwin, the NSC\u2019s director for Nonproliferation. ", " In a Monday briefing, Harf shot down a New York Times report saying that Iran had reneged on an earlier commitment to ship its nuclear material to Russia under a final deal, calling its claims \u201cblatantly wrong.\u201d ", " But Harf wouldn\u2019t promise that negotiators would have an agreement by midnight Tuesday.

On Friday night, Clinton strategist Joel Benenson will hold a similar dinner with reporters, correspondents and even some television anchors at his apartment in New York. ", " The dinners are part of a larger Clinton-team effort to build a rapport with the men and women who will spend the next 18 months covering Clinton\u2019s bid for the White House. That effort is seen as a necessity for a candidate who, in the early months of 2015, has had no safe harbor in the media. To date, The New York Times alone has published more than 40 articles related to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account while secretary of state, and many other news outlets, including POLITICO, have come forward with revelations of their own. Meanwhile, right-wing media outlets criticize her daily and left-wing outlets are unabashed in their desire for a more liberal alternative. ", "Story Continued Below", " Just last month, Clinton herself acknowledged that her relationship with the media was \u201ccomplicated,\u201d but said she wanted to build \u201ca better relationship.\u201d Without a formal campaign in place, however, she has been forced to assume a defensive posture. Now, with the launch of her campaign just around the corner, political strategists say the candidate and her team are set to wrest control of the narrative and go on offense. ", " \u201cPolitics, especially political reporters, abhor a vacuum, so media outlets are going to hunt and peck for stories that create the dynamic of the campaign being a yet-unannounced HRC presidential vs. the august members of the Fourth Estate,\u201d Chris Lehane, the Democratic communications strategist and Clinton White House alum, told POLITICO. \u201cOnce the campaign is off and running like Usain Bolt, based on the big idea she offers as her rationale, it will develop specific reporters and outlets that take a franchise interest.\u201d ", " The current state of Clinton-press relations reflects \u201cthe natural lay of things. She\u2019s not a candidate, there\u2019s not an affirmative message yet, and there\u2019s not yet an apparatus fully capable of combatting [these stories],\u201d said Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesperson. Merrill confirmed that the Clinton team had media outreach plans in the works, but said he was not in a position to discuss them. ", " Being able to go on the offensive is especially important for a candidate like Clinton, who has few sympathizers in the media. Supporters have long grumbled that the Times and its mainstream brethren are especially tough on Clinton \u2014 the newspaper\u2019s executive editor Dean Baquet calls the coverage \u201caggressive and fair\u201d \u2014 but the past six weeks have only increased their fears. Meanwhile, right-wing media outlets have been using the new revelations to relentlessly attack her, while left-wing publications have been busy pushing their own populist alternatives. ", " The trifecta of right-wing attacks, left-wing angst and mainstream scrutiny has already made for a far rockier campaign rollout than Clinton likely anticipated. Though a mid-March CNN/ORC poll had her beating every potential Republican challenger by double digits, a new Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that her support has been \u201cwilting\u201d in the key battleground states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. In each state, a majority of those surveyed said that Clinton\u2019s private email use was either \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201csomewhat important\u201d to their vote in 2016, and well more than a third of voters in each state said the issue made them less likely to vote for Clinton. ", " While the formal launch of a campaign will allow Clinton to take some control into her own hands, the absence of a viable primary challenger could pose its own problems, strategists said. With no real competitor, the media will be all the more eager to assume an antagonistic role. ", " \u201cIn the absence of a primary opponent, the press may feel obliged to fill that role, giving her the scrutiny and vetting normally provided by an opponent,\u201d Paul Begala, the political consultant and chief strategist for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, said. \u201cIf so, there is not much Hillary can do about it, nor should she try.\u201d ", " Of the three sectors of American political media, it is the mainstream that has emerged as Clinton\u2019s greatest obstacle. The fact that the hardest-hitting Clinton coverage has come from the Times, The Washington Post, POLITICO and other mainstream sources \u2014 rather than, say, The Weekly Standard or Washington Free Beacon \u2014 has revived concerns among her staff about Clinton\u2019s poor relations with mainstream reporters. ", " \u201cWe have been aggressive and fair,\u201d Baquet, the Times executive editor, said of his newspaper\u2019s coverage of Clinton. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s been the same for coverage of all the candidates. Some of the Republicans have gone so far as to say they don\u2019t read us. If everyone thinks you\u2019re tough, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d ", " In the past few weeks, Gawker and ProPublica have opened a new vein of Clinton coverage. On March 27, the two sites reported that longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal supplied intelligence to then-Secretary Clinton \u201cgathered by a secret network that included a former CIA clandestine service officer.\u201d Days later, Gawker reported that Blumenthal and another Clinton official had secretly lobbied Clinton \u201con behalf of a billionaire in the former Soviet state of Georgia who was seeking closer ties with Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 seemingly in violation of a federal law designed to prevent foreign powers from covertly wielding influence within the United States.\u201d ", " Critical coverage in outlets like the Times and ProPublica is far more dangerous to Clinton\u2019s campaign than that of partisan outlets, strategists say, because the scrutiny is driven by reporting, rather than ideological analysis (there are exceptions with Gawker, which can be quite opinionated). Weeks of Fox News roundtables about Benghazi conspiracy theories don\u2019t pack nearly the punch that a groundbreaking report from the Times can. ", " Merrill, the Clinton spokesperson, said he didn\u2019t have a problem with the Times\u2019 aggressive approach to the email scandal, especially since they broke the story. He was less forgiving of the Gawker-ProPublica report: \u201cProPublica, to be honest, I think my response to somebody who asked me that was just, \u2018Seriously?\u2019\u201d (ProPublica editor-in-chief Stephen Engelberg did not respond to a request for comment regarding Merrill\u2019s criticism.) ", " The drumbeat of investigations from the Times and other mainstream outlets might be more tolerable if Clinton had more allies on the left. Unfortunately for her, liberal pundits like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, and progressive publications like The Nation and The New Republic have seemed more interested in floating alternatives like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. ", " Late last year, The Nation made it its stated mission to find a populist challenger. Katrina vanden Heuvel, the magazine\u2019s editor, ", " that Clinton \u201cwould be better served if she has competition.\u201d In Harper\u2019s, Doug Henwood slammed Clinton as a hawkish centrist, a charge that has been echoed directly or indirectly across the liberal blogosphere and even on MSNBC. ", " \u201cThe Elizabeth Warren piece of it does make it tough for her with Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow and those guys,\u201d said Bill Burton, the Democratic strategist and former Obama deputy press secretary. \u201cIt is a challenge.\u201d ", " Then there are the right-wing publications, which attack Democrats as a matter of course. To date, however, right-wing attacks on Clinton have been relatively muted, in part because several conservative sites are focused on the Republican primary. Behind the scenes, however, Republican groups are building a massive opposition effort, much of which will be leaked to conservative and mainstream outlets over the course of the next 18 months. ", " Clinton may never be able to quell the right, but by launching her campaign, she can at least make progress on the left and the mainstream, the strategists said. ", " \u201c[The] campaign will convert some of the current entities by (a) being on the offensive and creating the conflict that drives coverage on its own terms; (b) filling the cup so that reporters can provide their daily quota of inches, clicks, tweets and retweets; and (c) demonstrate [the] capacity of the candidate where she can look like a giant towering over the sea of leprechauns across the aisle,\u201d Lehane explained. ", " \u201cIn this day and age,\u201d he added, \u201cthe ability to develop a national online network will provide a bulwark of support and be available to serve as both a sword to push out her candidacy and a shield to deflect the incoming.\u201d ", " Of course, not everyone is so bullish. ", " \u201cYou do get the sense that it\u2019s coming at her from all sides,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who asked not to be quoted by name. \u201cYou do wonder if at some point she\u2019s taking so much water that it all falls apart.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " After Clinton\u2019s extraordinary news conference on Tuesday, Gowdy released a statement saying he wanted to have Clinton before his panel twice in the near future. Clinton would appear in private to discuss the email controversy, and then in public to review the Benghazi attack itself.

", " After the private hearing, Gowdy said, Clinton will also be asked to testify at a public hearing that focuses specifically on U.S. policy in Libya and the security procedures the State Department relied on before and after the Sept. 11 attacks at the Benghazi compound. ", " That hearing \u2014 long in the works \u2014 will give Clinton a chance to address concerns that the State Dept. did not do enough to address lingering security concerns at the Benghazi complex and detail how the Obama administration developed a series of talking points used after the attacks. ", " Gowdy also criticized Clinton\u2019s call to release the roughly 55,000 pages of emails she has turned over to the State Department as insufficient. He called on Clinton to make the personal server on which she stored her communications available to a \u201cneutral, detached third-party arbiter.\u201d ", " Asked about that idea Tuesday in her news conference at United Nations headquarters in New York, Clinton was dismissive, saying only, \u201cWell first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee.\u201d ", " Gowdy signaled in his statement that he intended to broaden his probe beyond the Benghazi attacks.

These public records at issue are broader than Libya and broader than Benghazi,\u201d he said. ", " Clinton\u2019s appearance before the committee would be a watershed moment for the panel, which was first announced by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) last May. ", " Gowdy has run a quiet investigation since he was tapped as chairman, avoiding the attention-grabbing headlines that characterized previous Benghazi investigations in the House \u2014 until now. The panel has held only a handful of public hearings, which have focused on tactical issues like document production and embassy security.

Some of this other stuff is what we have found out, it\u2019s just been a result of our investigation. To me, it gives credence to this committee being formed in the first place, because there is now information coming out.\u201d ", " Boehner created the Benghazi Committee to act as a clearinghouse and final arbitrator on the terrorist attacks, which have already been investigated by a half-dozen congressional committees. Michael Steel, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican, credited the panel with advancing the probe by demanding Clinton\u2019s emails. ", " \u201cSecretary Clinton didn\u2019t hand over her emails out of the goodness of her heart \u2014 she was forced to by smart, determined, and effective oversight by the House Select Committee on Benghazi,\u201d Steel said. \u201cHer press conference raised more questions than it answered, and the American people deserve the truth.\u201d ", " Gowdy previously said hundreds of the emails the State Department sent the Benghazi Committee had never been seen by lawmakers investigating the attacks.

Gowdy has said he is putting off her appearance until the committee receives answers to its standing subpoena requests from the Obama administration and until he is confident Clinton has made available any documents related to Libya and Benghazi.

Today, the Israelis and Palestinians are engaged in a new game of chicken but as they accelerate toward each other, they have missed the reality that there is a gorge between them and they are each in danger of driving off the cliff. If there is a task for American diplomacy now, it is to try to get each off their self-destructive path. ", " For Prime Minister Netanyahu, his hard right tack in the campaign won him the election in Israel and lost him the world. President Obama\u2019s obvious anger and unwillingness to accept Netanyahu\u2019s effort to walk back his campaign statement on there being no Palestinian state so long as he was prime minister did not create his problems internationally but certainly has added to them. Indeed, fair or not, it is an unfortunate reality that few on the global stage believe Netanyahu is committed to trying to find a way to end Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinians. ", "Story Continued Below", " As a result, the ", " internationally will now have new momentum. ", " The prime minister is surely right about the profound danger that a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel, but Israel\u2019s next government also needs to treat the de-legitimization movement as a threat to Israel\u2019s existence. It is, after all, about trying to deny Israel\u2019s right to exist. ", " One problem with the White House\u2019s reaction to Netanyahu\u2019s comments is that it will feed not just the de-legitimization momentum but it will make the Palestinians feel free of any obligations. The onus will be on Israel, Palestinians can push the campaign against Israel at the International Criminal Court and other international fora, and nothing will be expected of them. Unfortunately, none of these steps will advance the day that Palestinians see an end to Israeli occupation or the emergence of their state. And, that will deepen the frustration of the Palestinian public which sees a gap between what its leaders claim and what they produce on the ground. That frustration is made all the worse when they see the conflict between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas paralyzing any efforts to rebuild a devastated Gaza\u2014a reality that according to Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki, has deeply undercut support for President Mahmoud Abbas among Palestinians. ", " Israel needs to take an initiative to counter the de-legitimization movement and show it is not the reason that nothing is possible on peace. Ironically, such an initiative might also shift the onus onto the Palestinians and move them off the position that all the responsibility for the conflict is Israel\u2019s and they need do nothing. In addition, it could also convince the Obama administration that it need not proceed either to support or draft a U.N. Security Resolution laying out the parameters for a permanent status deal, especially because Israel was acting to alter an unsustainable status quo. ", " The question is how to get Israel to take the first step. That should be the U.S. objective at this point. This is not the time to try to resume peace negotiations, when the disbelief on each side is so great and the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians has never been wider. To be sure, if the White House wants to move the prime minister to take a step after he forms a government, challenging his word in public won\u2019t make that more likely. Rather, it ought to cool the public rhetoric and privately convey that the U.S. ability to help Israel internationally now requires an Israeli move that lends credence to the prime minister\u2019s words. Even an administration more well-disposed to Netanyahu would be hard-pressed to convince the international community that he was serious about two states in the aftermath of his campaign statements. ", "By MATT LATIMER", "By ALFONSO GONZALES, SHANNON SPEED and GILBERTO ROSAS", "By CARRIE LEVINE", " So what steps could Netanyahu and the new Israeli government take to give the administration and its friends something to work with? They could declare that they were going to make Israel\u2019s settlement policy consistent with its two-state policy: meaning that Israel would only build in what it thinks will be Israel not in what it thinks will be part of the Palestinian state. In other words, Israel would not build in the 92 percent of the West Bank that is outside what Israel currently defines as the settlement blocs. Even if Netanyahu thinks that a two-state outcome cannot be implemented soon, he can at least show he will not act to make it more difficult to produce it. If he would also allow the Palestinians to build in parts of area C\u2014which makes up 60 percent of the West Bank\u2014that would boost the Palestinian economy and show the Palestinian public that the possibility of change remains. ", " Netanyahu will want something in return from the Palestinians or the United States. The Palestinians could turn away from internationalizing the conflict and commit anew to a negotiated outcome. In addition, President Abbas could agree to take over the crossing points in Gaza\u2014something the donor community, the Israelis and the Egyptians have held is the key to opening up Gaza for the movement of reconstruction materials and even people into the Strip. Ironically, this matters to the Israelis because they understand that if the pressure within Gaza is not reduced, there is bound to be another explosion and renewed warfare. ", " But creating these steps, which could jump-start a process, won\u2019t happen by itself. The United States will need to set it in motion. At this point, Netanyahu needs to blunt the de-legitimization movement, Abbas needs to regain some semblance of trust from his own people, and we need to foster a virtuous cycle between Israelis and Palestinians. Pressing for a quick return to negotiations\u2014or a Security Council Resolution that will trigger long discussions in New York and likely be ground down in the .U.N Cuisinart\u2014will yield none of these results. But focusing on practical steps could do so and move the Israelis and Palestinians off their self-destructive trajectories and in a far more hopeful direction.

", " Allies and staffers held a call after Clinton\u2019s first news conference in years, where the mood was one of determination to move on, multiple Clinton loyalists said. Clinton herself was eager to get past the controversy after being unenthused with having to answer questions about it in the first place. ", " \u201cThe story is one for embalmers,\u201d said longtime Clinton friend and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, reflecting the general view of Clinton\u2019s political orbit that the email question will soon lose its political salience.

First, as one Hillaryland veteran told POLITICO, \u201cit got her out there. Regular people could see how passionately she feels about her personal privacy and most people can empathize.\u201d ", " Just as important, Clinton\u2019s team hopes her public explanation transforms the storyline from the dangerous \u201cwhat\u2019s Hillary hiding?\u201d to a more defensible \u2014 and numbingly complex \u2014 set of conversations among media reporters and lawyers about what public officials can and can\u2019t do with their own emails. Despite warnings from Democrats around the country that the issue is still raging, Clinton allies figure that inside-baseball conversations like this don\u2019t resonate with everyday voters, and especially not with undecided voters in swing states. ", " In order to hasten the issue\u2019s fade to irrelevance, Clinton\u2019s team is redoubling its hiring and organizing efforts within the early presidential nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, operating as if she were facing a serious Democratic challenger. Allies think such political maneuvers would surely draw headlines given the political press corps\u2019 deep appetite for news of Clinton\u2019s plans over the coming months, distracting from the email questions.

Trey Gowdy \u2014 who leads the House panel investigating the Benghazi attacks \u2014 pledged to keep digging into Clinton\u2019s email use.

Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner declared that Tehran cannot be trusted to adhere to a deal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also escalated his warnings against the still-unfinished accord. ", " With an unofficial deadline of Tuesday looming to come to an agreement, Secretary of State John Kerry decided to cancel plans to appear Monday at a tribute in Boston for his mentor, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. He was joined in the Swiss city of Lausanne by emissaries from Tehran and from five other countries \u2014 Germany, China, Russia, France and Britain \u2014 involved in the negotiations. ", "Story Continued Below", " By late Sunday, however, it appeared several sticking points remained, including one that surprised many people following the talks. Iranian negotiator Abbas Araghchi said reports that Iran had agreed to ship its stockpile of uranium outside its borders were wrong. Earlier indications were the Iranians had agreed to send the material to Russia, presumably putting the fuel out of reach and unavailable for military purposes. ", " \u201cNone of the news that is being published is completely accurate, in particular about the transfer of uranium from the country,\u201d Araghchi said, ", " the semi-official Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency. \u201cThis is not in our program and we do not intend to do this.\u201d ", " He insisted, however, that there were other ways to ease worries that the uranium would be misused. The New York Times ", " that Western officials had suggested that the material could be diluted, for example, so that it\u2019s not easily enriched for use in an atomic weapons program. ", " Other points of contention in the talks include how to handle the sanctions leveled against Iran, what type of research and development on centrifuges the Iranians will be allowed to pursue in the coming years and in what format a preliminary deal would be presented to the public. ", " In another sign that a deal is not imminent, The Associated Press reported that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would leave the talks Monday afternoon but would return if an agreement is reached. ", " The U.S. domestic debate over the deal played out over the airwaves Sunday, with Boehner repeating his skepticism. The Islamic Republic\u2019s leaders \u201chave no intention of keeping their word,\u201d the Republican said on CNN, adding that the negotiations themselves are proof that current sanctions are working. ", " On ABC, meanwhile, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that if Boehner thinks \u201cthat the United States should bomb Iran to keep them from having a nuclear weapon \u2014 if he feels that way, he should have the courage of his convictions to say so.\u201d Earnest also reiterated that the White House is not looking to extend negotiations beyond Tuesday. ", " At the same time, Netanyahu, who views Iran as a mortal threat to his country, reportedly told his Cabinet on Sunday: \u201cThis deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that.\u201d ", " Pointing to Iran\u2019s backing of Houthi rebels advancing in Yemen, the latest front in the spreading violence in the Middle East, the Israeli leader warned: \u201cThe Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped.\u201d He also expressed his concerns ", " over the weekend. ", " Over the weekend, both sides insisted that it was time for the other to bend. ", " \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s time for the Iranians to send a clear signal to the international community about whether or not they are willing to make the serious commitments that are required,\u201d Earnest said Sunday. ", " \u201cIn negotiations, both sides must show flexibility,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote Saturday on Twitter. \u201cWe have, and are ready to make a good deal for all. We await our counterparts\u2019 readiness.\u201d ", " The Iranians want quick sanctions relief as part of the deal. ISNA reported Saturday that Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, said: \u201cThese negotiations have technical, legal and political dimensions, and they are all connected to each other. If we solve the technical issues but not the issue of sanctions, then there\u2019s no use in it.\u201d ", " But the U.S. and its partners have been hesitant to lift sanctions \u2014 of which there are various kinds involving multiple countries \u2014 without clear signs of change in Iran\u2019s behavior. According to Earnest, President Barack Obama believes it would \u201cbe unwise to, on the first day of an agreement with the Iranians, to take away all of the sanctions that have been in place for such a long time.\u201d ", " Some reports on Saturday suggested that the parties could issue a mere news release this coming week and leave off the completion of a preliminary deal for another few weeks. Whatever initial framework is reached would then be followed by technical amendments in the next few months. Also unclear is whether a preliminary deal would be put on paper or be largely oral. ", " Whatever format the deal takes, members of Congress, who are on recess for the next two weeks, will be eager to assert a role. Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, warned before leaving Washington on Friday that a bipartisan coalition would likely pass legislation requiring that Congress weigh in on the deal. ", " Corker said on CNN that before the Obama administration starts \u201cunraveling\u201d the sanctions on Iran that Congress put in place, \u201cwe want to make sure that they show us the deal.\u201d He added: \u201cI do think we are going to pass a piece of legislation that gives Congress that ability to weigh in on behalf of the American people.\u201d ", "SIMOND DEGALBERT", " Much of Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy hinges on the outcome of the talks. ", " As he ran for his first term, Obama separated himself from Democratic primary foe Hillary Clinton by asserting that he would try to engage America\u2019s adversaries, including Iran, without \u201cpreconditions.\u201d But the president\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran remains a flash point today, as even some Democrats bristle at the idea of easing sanctions against a country many simply do not trust. Oil-rich Iran has long insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful. ", " Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who may challenge Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, came to Obama\u2019s defense on Sunday, backing efforts to negotiate a settlement with Iran. During an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d O\u2019Malley castigated the 47 Republican senators who signed an open letter to Iran\u2019s leaders warning that any deal could be overturned by a new president. \u201cIf you hate the president of the United States more than you distrust the ayatollah, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be in the United States Senate,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. ", " The issue has also become a popular talking point for the Republicans hoping to replace Obama, with several accusing him for being soft on a longtime foe while weak in his support for Israel, a longtime ally. ", " Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, in announcing his bid for the Republican nomination on Monday, urged the audience to \u201cimagine a president who says \u2018I will honor the Constitution, and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.\u2019\u201d ", " As the nuclear talks have barreled ahead, violence has spread further in the Middle East. Yemen has become the latest battleground in a broader struggle between Iran and various U.S.-allied Arab states, including Saudi Arabia.

With his career and future suddenly in jeopardy, Menendez has vowed to keep his Senate seat. He refuses to say if he\u2019d give up his leadership post in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee if he\u2019s indicted.

", " Menendez is relying on his close ties to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to protect his committee spot, at least before any indictment. He\u2019s also gotten support from Republicans, who back his opposition to the Obama administration over Iran and Cuba and view the leaks as an attempt by the White House to silence him. ", " And Menendez has emphasized \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that Melgen has been a close friend for years, and that their two families have spent holidays together, attended the same family weddings and funerals and exchanged presents during special occasions. Such comments could help persuade Melgen to not cooperate with federal officials in their case against Menendez. So far, that approach seems to be working.

In their first caucus gathering since last week\u2019s news broke, Democrats attending Tuesday\u2019s lunch in the Senate\u2019s Lyndon B. Johnson Room didn\u2019t bring up Menendez\u2019s expected corruption charges, attendees said.

When pressed by reporters on whether Menendez should give up his post on the Foreign Relations Committee, Reid responded that \u201cSen. Menendez has done a stalwart job as the chair of the committee, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s been an outstanding senator.\u201d ", " And when asked why Democrats don\u2019t have their own formal rules to remove indicted senators from top committee posts, as Republicans do, Reid simply shrugged and moved on. ", " \u201cBeats me,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d ", " DOJ investigators are examining whether Menendez illegally took official action to benefit Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who is one of his biggest donors.

(Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin would probably be next in line to replace Menendez as the committee\u2019s ranking member.) ", " \u201cYour question is based on supposition,\u201d Menendez said, noting that he has not been charged with any wrongdoing at this point. \u201cAnd I am not going to engage in supposition.\u201d ", " A number of his Democratic colleagues aren\u2019t eager to pry into the details involving Menendez\u2019s case. The less they know, Democrats privately say, the easier it is to avoid questions about his future. ", " \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to let the facts play out at this point,\u201d said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, No. 4 in her party leadership.

We\u2019ll cross bridges when they come up in our path.\u201d ", " Murphy added: \u201cBob is a really strong voice in our caucus, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change no matter what happens over the next few weeks.\u201d ", " Yet even as he has emerged at the center of a growing scandal, Menendez has found some unlikely support from Republicans. A number of conservatives, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have questioned whether the case has been motivated by Menendez\u2019s high-profile role pushing back on the administration\u2019s Iran and Cuba policies. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he and Menendez have had multiple conversations over the committee\u2019s agenda, suggesting the Democrat is carrying on with his business as if he\u2019s not in legal jeopardy. ", " \u201cI have had two conversations with him in the last 24 hours \u2014 all of which were about policy issues that we need to deal with,\u201d the Tennessee Republican said. ", " Asked Tuesday if he would continue his outspoken criticism of the administration\u2019s foreign policies, Menendez said: \u201cI am going to be supportive when they do something positive, and when I don\u2019t agree, I am going to be a critic.\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

Cuba\u2019s presence at the summit is itself historic: It\u2019s the first time the island nation is attending. Cuba was pushed out of the Organization of American States in 1962 at the United States\u2019 urging, and its absence from the summits was a growing point of contention among attendees. ", " However, one sore point remains for the United States as the summit nears: Venezuela. ", " In many ways, Venezuela, a leading oil exporter whose economy is in shambles, has become a far greater concern in recent years to the U.S. than Cuba. Under the late Hugo Chavez and now current President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela has become stridently anti-American and, observers say, increasingly authoritarian. ", " In March, the Obama administration placed sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials accused of human rights abuses. Maduro, who is not as popular as Chavez, has pointed to the sanctions in an attempt to rally support, and he is likely to raise the issue repeatedly at the summit. ", " Regardless, removing Cuba from the terror list is an overture that should help \u201ctemper the anger on the part of Venezuela and frustration on the part of others in the region on the Venezuela sanctions decision,\u201d said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution\u2019s Latin America Initiative. ", " He added, however, that the U.S.-Venezuela relationship is not directly analogous to the U.S.-Cuba relationship, even though the \u201cVenezuelan government would like you to think they\u2019re a new Cuba because then they will play victim and rally support.\u201d Since the Cold War days, dynamics have shifted tremendously in Latin America, where democracy is ascendant overall, and the U.S. is still a major trading partner of Venezuela\u2019s. ", " One key aspect of the summit to watch, Piccone said, is how other nations at the summit react to Venezuela\u2019s complaints about the United States, and whether they will challenge Maduro\u2019s narratives. \u201cI think it\u2019s a test for the region to reinforce some basic principles that they\u2019ve adopted including respect for democracy and human rights,\u201d he said.

Western leaders have repeatedly stated their view that no deal would be preferable to a bad one\u2014a point that\u2019s yielded intense debate about what exactly would constitute a good deal versus a bad deal. Considering the highly technical nature of the issues at stake, it\u2019s no surprise the devil will be in the details. It will be hard to assess the deal before every provision of the last annex to the comprehensive agreement is signed on, if it ever happens. But assuming we do, assessing the quality of the agreement should mostly be done in light of its objectives and of the agreement\u2019s ability to fulfil them. ", " If a comprehensive deal is struck, it\u2019s important to remember that the deal is just the beginning. As hard as the negotiations have been, the implementation and enforcement of the deal over the coming years will be an ongoing challenge\u2014but it can be surmountable as long as the P5+1 set clear enforcement mechanisms. ", "Story Continued Below", " To understand what a deal will mean in the years ahead, it\u2019s important to understand how the negotiations unfolded. As a matter of fact, our expectations about what a comprehensive agreement could achieve have changed over time. Since 2002, concerns about the nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program have mostly been fueled by the covert development of enrichment activities, but also by their obvious inconsistency with any identifiable civilian needs and the acquisition of nuclear militarization know-how. Hence the long-term objective, enshrined in United Nations Security Council resolutions, to establish the exclusively peaceful nature of the program, through a full suspension of enrichment in Iran. ", " It is the assumption that this prerequisite would prevent a negotiated breakthrough that led P5+1 to alter the terms of their negotiation with Iran in the 2013 Joint Plan of Action. From that point forward, an agreement was not to be based on an unambiguous Iranian strategic shift, but rather on the insurance that Tehran\u2019s program would not be turned from its existing dual nature to an entirely military one. Such \u201cconstructive\u201d ambiguity about Iran\u2019s program and intentions could be achieved through agreed upon enrichment restrictions, the conversion of the heavy-water reactor of Arak and intrusive monitoring and verification. ", " This evolution of the negotiation\u2019s objectives relates today to many of the concerns about the time-limited nature of the restrictions that will be imposed on enrichment in Iran. Critics point out that such time limitations, referred to as the \u201csunset clause,\u201d will enable Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon after restrictions would end, or at least to develop industrial-scale enrichment capacities then. Iran\u2019s insistence to continue R&D activities on advanced centrifuges does not bode well in that respect. ", " As many experts have rightly said, the reality is that Iran will always remain subject to its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations. As a result, if Iran nuclear activities continue to have a questionable civilian credibility after restrictions do end, the international community will remain entitled to challenge Tehran through international non-proliferation mechanisms and eventually through diplomacy, sanctions or coercive options. A comprehensive agreement is not a blank check; Iran should not interpret it as such. ", " While pursuing an altered objective, an agreement that efficiently prevents and deters Iran from breaking out of its obligations and of the NPT, while reducing the risk of military escalation, will protect the P5+1 interests. This is especially true considering the lack of current realistic alternatives, and it will remain so as long as Iran respect it. ", " We shall keep in mind, though, that it may not entirely solve the Iranian nuclear issue if Tehran keeps insisting in a decade or more on building a program that does not make any sense from a civilian nuclear energy standpoint. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Iran may change in the future, thanks to the benefits that a comprehensive agreement will bring to her economy and her people. But what matters even more is, if that does not happen, the P5+1 will remain politically determined to enforce the NPT and stands ready to play the long game with Iran. If a comprehensive agreement is finally reached, that long game will require multiple tracks. ", " First, P5+1 must be determined to enforce the deal and set clear mechanisms to answer to any Iranian violations. It is easy to say today, but running away from the agreement in the future will be politically costly: Absent a blatant violation such as the discovery of further covert activities or facilities, the comprehensive agreement may over time become \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Short of obvious violations, P5+1 will also need to ensure that Iran refrains from testing the boundaries and ambiguities of the deal\u2014something that Tehran may realistically try to do based on past records. The threat of sanctions snap-back could help to deter Iran, but the political will to expose all violations and/or \u201cexcursions\u201d will also be critical to protect the integrity of the deal overtime. Individuals and entities that may conduct activities going against the objectives and provisions of the agreement could and should be sanctioned by the U.S. and the European Union. ", " Second, P5+1 will need to retain over the years ahead the relevant expertise and intelligence to be in a position to complement the verification mechanisms that the comprehensive agreement will put in place. Those tools should enable the IAEA to have all access that it will deem necessary. But Iran\u2019s nuclear program shall remain a priority for all national agencies dealing with non-proliferation. Sufficient funding should be provided to them to do that. It will seem obvious in a year from now, but less so overtime while everyone\u2019s focus will shift to tomorrow\u2019s crisis. ", " Third, some countries in the Middle East will ask for reassurance following a comprehensive agreement with Iran. Some may be willing to find self-reassurance by developing domestic enrichment capacities to prepare themselves to reciprocate an Iranian break-out or Iranian long-term ambitions. Such sensitive technologies proliferation in the region would be very dangerous and P5+1 shall try to discourage them by convincing their allies that enhanced security assurances and their determination to oppose eventual Iranian destabilizing regional behavior will protect them more than acquiring uranium enrichment. ", " Finally, P5+1 will need to remain determined to go back to a confrontational approach if Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions remain mostly inconsistent with the NPT in the future, a possibility that an agreement will not discard. Iran has been very consistent over the past two decades in its pursuit of a dual-capable nuclear program. The agreement under discussion is the most realistic way to deal with it in the near future. But beyond it, the international community will need to be as consistent as Iran to defend its own strategic objective: an exclusively peaceful nuclear program in Iran.

Menendez was up for reelection in 2012, and most of Melgen\u2019s donation to the super PAC was poured into the New Jersey Senate race.

So how did today\u2019s appearance compare to past Clinton performances before the media? Did we see the same Clinton, or has her demeanor before the press changed? We asked a handful of Clinton watchers\u2014from biographers to reporters who covered Bill Clinton\u2019s administration\u2014to weigh in, and here\u2019s what they had to say. ", " *** ", "Story Continued Below", " ", " ", " ", "Hillary Clinton: The Inside Story ", " ", " As Hillary Clinton prepared to invite her United Nations audience today to \u201clook back 20 years\u201d and feel \u201cgratified\u201d at the progress that women have made, worldwide, since the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, she undoubtedly didn\u2019t expect her words to inspire a much less welcome looking back at her own past. ", " But it was impossible not to think back today to the famous 1994 \u201cpink press conference,\u201d when a younger, softer-voiced, and considerably less annoyed-looking First Lady (in a pink St. John knit suit) responded to reporter questions about her reluctance to hand over tax records relating to her cattle futures trading and an obscure real estate investment that she and her husband had made with friends in Arkansas. ", " Today\u2019s soon-to-be presidential candidate was older, more confident, more impatient and clearly more comfortable with her own not-altogether-hidden anger than was the former First Lady, who spoke with forced joviality of having had to accept that the \u201czone of privacy\u201d she had cultivated throughout her adult life was now public property. (\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been rezoned,\u201d she said then.) Yet, in so many ways, today\u2019s appearance was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Clinton-style: talk of an independent investigator, Chelsea, Bill and Dorothy Rodham\u2019s memory in the wings, an admission, much more grudging this time, that Hillary Clinton\u2014a \u201cfairly private person leading a public life,\u201d as she put it in 1994\u2014may find her self-protective instincts deeply at odds with the demands of political transparency. ", " Many questions will be raised in the coming days, but for now one looms largest: How could so smart and seasoned a political actor, perhaps the most scrutinized public figure in America, have been so blind to eventual appearances about the way she handled her email? According to 1994\u2019s Hillary, it all goes back to that Rodham upbringing: \u201cI was raised to really believe that what was important was what you thought about yourself and how you measured up to the standards you set for yourself,\u201d she explained in April of that year, breaking a steady stream of dogged financial detail to pause and recollect her parents\u2019 words: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t listen to what other people say. Don\u2019t be guided by other people\u2019s opinions.\u2019\u201d ", " Great words to live by\u2014if you\u2019re not making a life in politics.

She raised new questions and gave new ammunition to those skeptical of her character and commitment to transparency. The encounter couldn\u2019t have been much better for those who do like and trust Clinton, yet wonder about her judgment, management skills and penchant for control. Heck, even Clinton admits it was a mistake to throw her emails on yoga and affairs of state into the same private blender. Or server. And then apparently delete the thousands she deemed personal. ", " Maybe Clinton really did use private email out of a simple desire to schlep one device rather than two. And yes, her husband already had the system set up. But he was a former president, not a sitting Cabinet member. Did she never think through the potential for problems? ", " It must be said that Clinton made the best of a difficult moment. Under pressure equal to a congressional hearing or the 2008 campaign, she avoided damaging sound bites and greeted tough questions with smiles. With the media riveted on her, she plugged her work for women and girls, and ripped into the 47 Republican senators who tried to derail nuclear negotiations in a letter to Iran. Her references to planning vacations, Chelsea\u2019s wedding and her mother\u2019s funeral on email reinforced a relatable style that has served her well.

Once upon a time, in the era before email and whose \u201cserver\u201d was whose, it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue at all: Dean Acheson, for instance, lived in no fear that the public would have access to his personal letters musing about the intentions of Stalin or the presence of possible Soviet spies in the State Department alleged by Joe McCarthy, or any number of other matters of state. Long before that, presidents in particular were free to keep or dispose of their papers as they saw fit; one obscure president, Chester Arthur, sealed his obscurity by instructing his family to burn his papers after his death. ", " And that was a rule of thumb for anyone in the old days: You could decide on your own what was public and private, and what you wanted to keep and what you wanted to destroy. ", "Story Continued Below", " It is only in the last few decades that our entire understanding of what is public and what is private, who controls information, who owns it and who has a right to it, has become deeply and destructively muddled. Clinton\u2019s attempt to carve out some sphere of privacy stems directly from a political culture that has seemingly managed the worst of all possible worlds: a fetish to classify as much as possible on the one hand, and on the other a surveillance and gotcha culture that seeks to make the keeping of secrets impossible. ", " One problem is that government protocols about e-mail and instant message retention have evolved much more slowly than the technologies have. What\u2019s more, there used to be a bright line between personal and public papers, or between official and unofficial correspondence, with it fully understood and unquestioned that high officials could and would maintain a considerable corpus that they and they alone would control, own and determine access to. ", " The watershed here, as in so much else in contemporary politics, was Watergate. That scandal shed light on what had been common practice, namely for presidents and high officials to keep separate public and private records. Before Watergate the public records would be retained by the government, but the private records were treated the same as the papers and diaries of any private citizen\u2014one reason why so many personal and professional records from the 19th\u00a0century have been lost. It was understood that even public servants have a legitimate sphere of privacy. ", " Presidents and officials throughout the 19th\u00a0and early 20th\u00a0century tended to be voluminous letter writers. That, after all, was how most communication occurred, other than face-to-face meetings. It is why the papers of Thomas Jefferson include more than 18,000 letters. Presidents and officials often meticulously kept their records, wanting to maintain an archive for that fuzzy muse \u201cposterity.\u201d But, and this is crucial, there was little notion that the public however defined had a right to read those letters, except those written purely in an official capacity. ", " Since the 1970s, however, the abuse of that privacy, along with abuses of executive authority, led to the ", ", which created a clearer distinction between public and private records. Much of that stemmed from President Nixon\u2019s attempt to forestall requests for documents about the Watergate affair, and for tape recordings, on the principle that they were his private papers and recordings to dispose of as he saw fit. The Presidential Records Act sat side by side with the earlier Federal Records Act, which established guidelines for how government agencies were to archive their material and turn it over to the National Archives. All of these laws were passed when records were kept primarily on paper, with some notable exceptions such as that audio recording system installed the Oval Office. All of these laws exempt some national security communications from release on a case-by-case basis, as well as certain communications between a president and his advisers, and the same pertains to other high officials. None of these laws covered what has become the primary means of communications: email. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", " Meanwhile, the post-Watergate culture of Washington and of the press led to a near-continuous culture of scandal, which not a single president has been immune to. Reagan and Iran-Contra, George H.W. Bush and Iraqgate, the Clintons from Whitewater to Monicagate, George W. Bush about yellow-cake and intelligence, the Obama administration from IRS investigations to Benghazi and Fast and Furious. That has led to near continual subpoenas for documents from executive officials. ", " At the same time, the brief interregnum after the end of the Cold War in 1989 saw a thawing of the culture of government secrecy that came to an abrupt end with the attacks of 9/11.

The chaotic indignity of Tuesday\u2019s press conference on her use of a private email server as Secretary of State did nothing to change that opinion, or convince her to push up the campaign start date. ", "Story Continued Below", " The firestorm over the emails \u2013 and earlier stories about the solicitation of foreign donations at the Clinton family charitable foundation have rattled the expanding crew of new operatives signing up for 2016 who haven\u2019t experienced the maelstrom of a Clinton presidential campaign before. But the only two opinions that really count come from Hillary and Bill Clinton, and \u2013 despite the carping of Democrats inside and outside their own circle \u2014 they harbor few regrets about the way things have gone down so far. ", " \u201cEighteen months ago who would imagined Hillary Clinton would have zero competition in the primaries? That\u2019s pretty good, right?\u201d said one longtime Clinton insider, reflecting the prevailing view in the no-rush camp, which includes the Clintons and their longtime consigliore Cheryl Mills. ", " \u201cEverybody has an incentive to start this campaign \u2013 the staff, the consultants who are working for nothing and want to get paid, you guys in the media \u2013 everybody except Hillary Clinton,\u201d the person added. \u201cThe goal here is to make this the shortest campaign possible. The emails thing didn\u2019t change that.\u201d ", " The danger, of course, is that the 20 ", " Century political victors are ignoring 21 ", " Century political reality and inviting the American body politic play by their idiosyncratic set of rules \u2014 as they did by deciding to use Bill Clinton\u2019s private server as a conduit for Hillary Clinton\u2019s government correspondence. Moreover, as the press conference proved, it\u2019s put her in the familiar \u2014 and bizarre \u2014 position of entering the 2016 campaign as both the strongest non-incumbent ever to seek the office and a wounded, vulnerable frontrunner. ", " \u201cShe\u2019ll get past these sort of little dust-ups, but we really have to start having a conversation,\u201d says Iowa Democratic operative Tavis Hall, expressing the growing anxiousness of battleground Democrats eager for Clinton to hoist a flag to rally around. ", " The response to the emails controversy was hampered by the lack of a campaign team \u2014 and the candidate\u2019s reluctance to share details of her personal email server with the people who could defend her; Clinton\u2019s people were rebuffed by surrogates who refused to appear on TV because they weren\u2019t given details about the system, according to two potential surrogates interviewed by POLITICO. Moreover, it took eight days for Clinton to reluctantly agree to appear before the media \u2014 and only then at the urging of her young campaign manager Robbie Mook and eminence-grise campaign chairman John Podesta. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s clear they lack an apparatus. She\u2019s a candidate without a campaign.\u201d Robert Gibbs, a former White House press secretary under President Obama told The Washington Post. And former Obama strategist David Axelrod told MSNBC he thought the campaign\u2019s sluggish response on the emails story was the result of a \u201clack of answers from the Clinton campaign, or the nascent campaign.\u201d ", " Last September, another Obama stalwart, 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe, was summoned to Clinton\u2019s home in Washington for a consultation with the would-be candidate. His advice? Start assembling a campaign apparatus as quickly as possible, set them to work immediately \u2014 and more, importantly, settle on a robust rationale for the campaign not based merely on her celebrity or gender. ", " She\u2019s mostly ignored that advice \u2014 and details about her personnel moves have proven far more plentiful than details about her policy plans, or her rationale for seeking the job, apart from vague references to her experience and a new willingness to emphasize her role as a gender trailblazer. ", " Yet, in some respects, Clinton has showed a willingness to change her basic approach as a candidate. Late last year, she enlisted another Obama mainstay, pollster Joel Benenson, to oversee a sprawling polling operation, supervise messaging and hire a communications team. Benenson\u2019s philosophy in assembling the team was to avoid the hard-edged, confrontational approach of the Clinton 2008 war room \u2014 and he enlisted current White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, a veteran Democrat operative with deep relationships in the media, to head the team. \u201cShe\u2019s hiring people who believe in engaging reporters, not beating the shit out of them,\u201d said one person close to Clinton. ", " But campaigns invariably reflect the attitude of the candidate, and Clinton \u2014 scarred deeply by the Whitewater and Lewinsky battles of the 1990s \u2014 still thinks of the press corps as hostile adversaries who often carry the water of GOP opposition researchers. \u201cLook, she hates you. Period. That\u2019s never going to change,\u201d a 2008 Clinton veteran told me when I asked if her attitude towards the media had evolved. ", " All of this has fostered a deep reluctance to formally jump into the 2016 fray, even as the political and journalistic bullets have started whizzing past. As recently as December, people close to her say, Clinton was still seriously considering not running in 2016 \u2014 at least that what she was telling friends. And she didn\u2019t start reading the pile of campaign memos aides and would-be staffers had compiled for her until Christmas, when she started telling people she would probably take the plunge, according to several aides I spoke to. ", " She approached the press conference with a sense of even-tempered resignation, they told POLITICO, with little of the finger-pointing from staff, or the cold silences on conference calls that characterized her reactions to bad news in 2008. Mostly, she was ticked off that the email story overshadowed the release of a report, partly funded by the Clinton foundation, on the educational and economic progress of woman around the world (Tellingly, she was particularly annoyed that The New York Times, a paper she believes she has battled for decades, didn\u2019t write about the \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d report more extensively). ", " Yet for close observers of Clinton, Tuesday\u2019s performance offered the glimmer of a new more conciliatory approach, and a little more ease in the campaign klieg lights. ", " \u201cLooking back, it would\u2019ve been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts,\u201d she told reporters with a sheepish smile. \u201cI thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\u201d ", " Several people close to Clinton pointed out that those remarks \u2014 widely criticized for garbling the technical details in question \u2014 represented a change from her behavior in 2008, when Clinton was almost universally unwilling to admit fault for fear of being labeled indecisive (In the last campaign, it took her months, for instance, to concede that she had not actually flown into a live-fire zone during a trip to the Balkans in the 1990s). ", " But this week Clinton agreed, without complaint, when advisers suggested she concede that she made a mistake in using her private email account. To one veteran of Hillaryland, it was part of a welcome trend of humanizing contrition: Last summer she issued a semi-apology last summer for suggesting she was \u201cdead broke\u201d upon leaving the White House in 2000.

But Menendez has also insisted on tangible evidence of progress, beyond mere assurances from a White House with which he has an uneasy relationship.

", " The nuclear talks, aimed at ensuring Iran remains at least a year away from being able to develop a nuclear weapon, have been extended twice since Secretary of State John Kerry struck an initial temporary accord in November 2013. The most recent extension, reached last November, promised a political agreement by March and a comprehensive deal that includes complex technical details by June 30.

In his January State of the Union address, President Obama vowed to veto the Kirk-Menendez bill, because \u201cthe American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort.\u201d ", " An Obama White House spokeswoman was blunter in January of last year, saying of the legislation, \u201cIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so.\u201d ", " The deadline issue is further complicated by the fact that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t accept the idea of a March 24 deadline for a political agreement \u2014 or that there even is a deadline.

Policies with short-term appeal often come with disagreeable longer-term consequences. And that may be exactly what is happening on Capitol Hill as politicians line up against a nuclear deal with Iran. ", " Today, there are many who are prepared to reject a negotiated nuclear agreement with Iran on the grounds that a return to coercive pressure and isolation will ensure the elimination of the entire Iranian nuclear capability and extend that \u201czero probability\u201d of a nuclear weapon into the indefinite future. This is close to the position that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out in his speech to Congress last week. ", "Story Continued Below", " Certainly, turning back the clock and eliminating every aspect of nuclear know-how in Iran would be desirable. But proponents of an even more coercive policy should recognize that if they get their wish, they may create a security threat far greater than the limited threat they are now trying to prevent. ", " We don\u2019t need a fortuneteller or crystal ball to predict the outcome of such a policy. We have more than three decades of experience to draw upon, based on the policies of eight successive American presidents and four presidents of Iran. Over that period of time, Iran has been subjected to a wide variety of sanctions and pressures. Originally these were mostly unilateral pressures from the U.S., but under the Obama administration they have become far more international and far-reaching, culminating in the crippling sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil sales and its ability to access international financial markets. ", " Twice, Iran has come to the negotiating table. The first time was in 2003-05, when the Iranian negotiating team of Hassan Rohani and Javad Zarif \u2014 not yet president and foreign minister \u2014 made a proposal to cap Iran\u2019s centrifuges at about 3,000. The United States was not a direct participant in those talks with several European states, but it is widely acknowledged that the George W. Bush administration vetoed the talks for essentially the same reason as opponents of the present negotiations. It was believed that the danger of permitting Iran to operate several thousand centrifuges was too great. Moreover, the coercive pressures available to the United States and the international community had scarcely been tried, and sanctions had not really begun to bite. ", " We all know what happened. With sanctions increasing almost by the day, and with increasing threats of a unilateral attack by Israel (which would probably draw in the U.S. and others), Iran steadily increased its nuclear program. By the time Rohani and Zarif returned to the field in 2013, Iran had about 20,000 centrifuges installed in two major sites \u2014 one of them deep underground \u2014 and a substantial stockpile of enriched uranium. Some of the uranium was enriched to nearly 20 percent, which is well on the way to weapons level. ", " That situation was so alarming that Netanyahu appeared before the United Nations General Assembly displaying a cartoon drawing that showed a bomb filling with 20 percent enriched uranium. He estimated that it would arrive at the red line \u2014 enough to produce a bomb\u2019s worth of highly enriched uranium very quickly \u2014 by the following summer. Many close observers of Israel believed that an attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure was imminent. ", " Netanyahu, in various capacities, had been warning of an imminent Iranian nuclear weapon since at least 1992, when he told the Israeli Knesset that Iran could have a bomb in three to five years. He and others, in Israel and elsewhere, have made similar predictions almost annually for the past two decades. ", " It is easy to dismiss these predictions as fear-mongering about something that obviously never happened. But it is much more instructive to understand that what they were saying had a basis in fact: During this entire period, Iran was steadily increasing its capability to produce a nuclear bomb. The more interesting fact is that Tehran did not follow through. By virtually every estimate, Iran has had the capability to produce a nuclear weapon for at least a decade. The predictions were wrong, not about Iran\u2019s ability but about its willingness to use that capability to produce a weapon. The entire U.S. intelligence community and most of our allies \u2014 apparently including Israel \u2014 have concluded with high confidence that Iran has not made a decision to build a bomb. ", " The second round of multilateral negotiations with Iran is approaching the finish line. The details have not been announced, but the outlines of an agreement seem to be emerging. Netanyahu\u2019s cartoon bomb has been drained. It is now empty of 20 percent enriched uranium, and all indications point to the fact that Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium will be severely limited for the foreseeable future. Iran is the world\u2019s most inspected state. It has apparently agreed to accept vigorous international inspection in perpetuity in return for an agreement that lifts the most onerous sanctions on its commerce. Iran has ceased development of its heavy water reactor at Arak, which produces plutonium \u2014 the shortest route to weapons-quality fissile material \u2014 and will modify it permanently. And the most severe restrictions ever imposed on a state will reportedly be accepted for a decade or more before Iran is gradually permitted to assume its position as a \u201cnormal\u201d member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which explicitly prohibits Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ", " On the other hand, if this agreement is rejected, as the Israeli prime minister and many in Congress are proposing, we go back to the early days of 2013: heavy sanctions, a rapidly increasing Iranian nuclear program and a looming threat of war. That is surely something no responsible statesman or politician would wish to see.

", " Kendall called the request pointless, saying Clinton\u2019s IT staff had confirmed to him the messages are gone for good. ", " But permanent deletion is extremely difficult to achieve, the experts said. Enterprise servers built in the last decade or so are increasingly designed to preserve emails more rigorously, either as a document trail in case of a lawsuit, to comply with industry regulations or to allow system administrators to \u201cidiot proof\u201d their systems so they can save the day when non-technically proficient executives accidentally delete emails.

", " But it only came to light this month that the State Department did not have copies of Clinton\u2019s emails because she used a personal account and server to conduct official business \u2014 instead of a standard government address. The House Benghazi committee subpoenaed Benghazi correspondence from Clinton\u2019s personal email March 4, and Gowdy followed up March 20, formally asking Clinton to turn her server over to the State Department inspector general or another neutral third party to assess whether any of the ostensibly personal emails contain government business. ", " The subpoena, which deadlined Friday, requested only documents. But after Clinton refused to hand over the server, top House Republicans are coalescing around a plan to talk to her first before they consider subpoenaing it, according to someone familiar with the conversations. ", " In the letter Friday, Clinton\u2019s attorney said there was no legal authority to force Clinton to turn over the server and that any arguments related to public access to federal records were addressed because she turned over her work emails to the State Department. ", " The experts interviewed by POLITICO said the amount of information that can be retrieved depends on the type of server Clinton used, its control settings and the rigor and expertise of the people who pressed the delete key. ", " \u201cObviously Clinton has someone with technical capability to run a mail server for her. Whether that person is actively capable of interfering with an investigation, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s another technological step up.\u201d said Hal Pomeranz, founder of Deer Run Associates, a computer forensics investigation firm. ", " Rasch, the cyber-crimes prosecutor now in private practice, compared deleting an email in standard email systems, such as Microsoft\u2019s Outlook or Google\u2019s Gmail, to placing a computer desktop item in the recycle bin. ", " In other words, the item can still be recovered until you do something else, such as empty the bin. ", " With most email systems, that something else would be putting another email in the deleted email\u2019s place, a process called \u201coverwriting.\u201d A file may need to be overwritten multiple times before it\u2019s totally gone. It may fast begin to look like a piece of Swiss cheese, however, with section after section degraded or missing. ", " On a busy corporate network, a deleted email might be overwritten within a few hours because emails are constantly coming in and going out and system administrators are regularly compressing email storage to save space, said Jake Williams, a principal consultant at Rendition Infosec. ", " On a personal server with only one or a few users, however, it could take months or years to overwrite that space, said Williams, also a computer forensics consultant at the SANS Institute, a non-profit computer security training center. ", " Clinton\u2019s statement from her March 10 press conference \u2013 \u201cat the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails\u201d \u2014 suggests that the emails were not deleted sporadically over the course of the last several years but all at once a couple of weeks ago after she stopped regularly using the server or the email system. That would indicate that most of the emails are likely intact and in good shape, Williams said. ", " That\u2019s provided, of course, that whoever deleted the emails simply pressed the delete key rather than running a more complex command, such as ordering the computer to \u201cwipe\u201d or \u201cburn\u201d its email contents or using a plug in that ensures deleted emails are rapidly overwritten. ", " Clinton Spokesman Nick Merrill declined to say what kind of server the former secretary used or the year it was built. He also declined to comment on the server\u2019s e-discovery settings or the specific deletion protocol.

", " In ", " ", ", Reid, 75, said his brutal eye injury in January that nearly left him blind in one eye gave him time to reevaluate his life and career. His departure will deprive the Senate of one of its fiercest infighters, who played a lead role in shepherding President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law through the chamber and regularly stymied Republicans. ", "Story Continued Below", " \u201cI\u2019ve had time to ponder and to think. We\u2019ve got to be more concerned about the country, the Senate, the state of Nevada than us,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAnd as a result of that, I\u2019m not going to run for reelection.\u201d ", " A person close to Reid said he made the decision before his January exercise injury that broke bones around his eye and ribs and led to multiple surgeries. Reid wanted to sit with the decision for a while and see how he felt about it. While on the mend at his Washington condo during the first part of the legislative session, Reid did not change his mind but kept his decision secret, even vowing publicly to run for reelection. ", " He plans to remain Democratic leader until the end of next year when the current Congress adjourns. He informed President Barack Obama of his decision Thursday night, a source said. ", " The announcement caps a career in Washington spanning more than three decades, starting in 1983 in the House. After winning a Senate seat in 1986, Reid tended heavily to home-state matters: a planned nuclear waste dump in Southern Nevada, and mining and grazing policies that affected the vast rural northern part of his state, much of it under federal control and where Reid was widely disliked. ", " First and foremost, Reid was a relentless critic of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository about 100 miles outside of Las Vegas, repeatedly gumming up the Senate to slow progress on the multi-billion dollar project, which was ultimately scrapped. ", " Reid, a soft-spoken, uninspiring public speaker but savvy backroom political operator, plotted his way up the rungs of Democratic leadership. In 2005 he became Senate Democratic leader, and two years later majority leader. ", " As leader, Reid developed a no-nonsense, hard-ball style that came to define his stewardship. He muscled through Senate passage of the Affordable Care Act on Christmas Eve in 2009 on a straight party-line vote, when his party controlled 60 seats, enough to overcome a GOP filibuster. In 2013, Reid took the unprecedented step of invoking the so-called \u201cnuclear option,\u201d a move that gutted filibuster rules for presidential nominations that critics said altered the deliberative nature of the body. ", " And as a senator, Reid\u2019s politics grew more liberal, moving to the left on issues like gun control, abortion rights and immigration. ", " But after losing the Senate majority last year, a number of Democrats blamed his tight grip on the amendment process, and the lack of Senate votes, for being a liability in the midterm elections that led to the loss of nine Democratic seats. For the first time in his career, Reid faced open dissension among senators about returning to the Democratic leadership post. As he ran for minority leader unopposed, Reid lost at least six votes from his colleagues, a sign that he was for the first time vulnerable in the top post. ", " \u201cI want to be able to go out at the top of my game,\u201d Reid told The New York Times. ", " With his departure now imminent, Democrats who have been waiting for a chance to succeed Reid will have the opportunity to run for leader. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who currently is the chief messenger for the caucus and serves as the No. 3, is viewed within the chamber as the clear frontrunner. It\u2019s unclear yet if others may run, but Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, endorsed Schumer for the job Friday. ", " Such a race, however, typically occurs after an election, behind closed doors, and is conducted via a secret ballot, meaning there are an array of possibilities that could take place. ", " Moreover, his decision throws into flux the Nevada Senate race, which was already expected to be one of the most heavily contested in the country. Reid had been insisting he would run for reelection, interviewing staff and fundraising for a campaign. He even told his staff at a private meeting in the Senate Mansfield Room in February ", " ", " With poor approval ratings back home, Reid faced an all-out battle to survive, similar to the improbable victory he pulled off in 2010 against tea party favorite Sharron Angle. ", "\n  ", " ", " Now Democrats will look closely at Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general. While the Republicans hope that the popular Nevada governor, Brian Sandoval, will run, he has long been viewed as very unlikely to do so. The Nevada Senate GOP leader, Michael Roberson, has been seen as a potential candidate for the seat. ", " Born in the dusty mining town of Searchlight, Nev., and raised in a tiny house with no running water, Reid grew to be a fixture in Las Vegas and Nevada politics for years before becoming one of Washington\u2019s most powerful figures. After first being elected as his state\u2019s lieutenant governor at age 30 in 1970, he was defeated in his first try at the Senate four years later. ", " He then lost a bid for mayor but found his footing atop the Nevada Gaming Commission, where he battled organized crime and his wife even found a bomb in the family car. Before his career in politics, Reid was an amateur boxer and served as a Capitol Police Officer in Washington. ", " \u201cSomeone with my background, my upbringing, to have the experiences I\u2019ve had is really a miracle,\u201d Reid said in the video. \u201cAnd I want you to know that I am so grateful for your invaluable help.

Yet in Reid\u2019s case, it\u2019s an attribute that\u2019s been raised to high art. Cross Reid and you will pay a price at some point. Jon Ralston, the dean of Nevada political reporters, refers to Reid as \u201cPrince Harry,\u201d and he means that in the most Machiavellian way possible.

Beyond that, he wasn\u2019t really worried too much what you thought of him, especially if you\u2019re a member of the press. ", " For his senators, Reid always had time. He listened to them, soothed their bruised egos, and cajoled and leaned on them when necessary. He raised money for their races and did other political grunt work, and when the time came, they voted for him as leader. In fact, his biggest backers were the female senators he helped elect to office, which would probably surprise the casual Reid watcher.

But always a belief that the future would be better. And worthy of a movie of some kind, if anyone could figure out how to make it. ", " The youngest of four sons, Harry Reid Jr., was born in Searchlight, Nev., on Dec. 2, 1939. He grew up dirt poor in a one-room shack with no indoor plumbing and no telephone. Harry Reid Sr., a miner, would often take his boys down into the mine with him. Reid\u2019s mother, Inez, did laundry for \u201chouses of ill repute,\u201d in Reid\u2019s own words. Reid\u2019s father, an alcoholic, committed suicide when Reid was 23.

He first enrolled in Southern Utah State College, and ended up graduating from Utah State University in 1961. Reid attended George Washington School of Law, which he completed in 1964. During law school, he moonlighted as a U.S. Capitol Police officer. ", " In one of the pivotal moments in his life, Reid met Landra Gould in high school. In 1959, the couple eloped and were married. Landra\u2019s parents, who were Jewish, didn\u2019t care for the agnostic Reid. An amateur boxer, Reid got in a fistfight with his future father-in-law. But Harry and Landra thrived: they had four sons and a daughter, and he would make no major decision without her. Reid converted to Mormonism in 1960, and she later did as well. ", " After getting his law degree, Reid returned to Henderson, where he became a city attorney and started developing the political contacts that would benefit him later in his career. ", " Reid was elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1968 and two years later was tapped by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mike O\u2019Callaghan to be his running mate. Reid would serve as lieutenant governor until 1974, when he ran for the U.S. Senate and lost to Republican Paul Laxalt. The next year, Reid was defeated in his bid for mayor of Las Vegas. ", " His political career in deep jeopardy, Reid regrouped. He was appointed chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission in 1977, earning a name for himself for taking on organized crime. A bomb was found planted on his car, and Reid let the FBI videotape a gangster trying to give him a $12,000 bribe. Reid put the man in a chokehold on camera. ", " In 1982, Reid was elected to the House and served two terms. Then his big break came when Laxalt retired in 1986. Reid ran for the Senate and won. He coasted to reelection in 1992, but in 1998, Reid suffered a near-death political experience in his race against Republican John Ensign. Reid eked out a 428-vote victory out of more than 435,000 votes cast, prevailing only after a recount. ", " Inside the Senate, Reid snagged a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee, where he learned from fellow Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) how to steer hundreds of millions of dollars in pork projects back home. Reid was happy to do it, especially considering the federal government controlled more than four-fifths of the land in his state and had used it as a site for nuclear weapons tests.

He would end up prevailing on that as well: After billions in federal dollars were sunk into the project, it was ultimately scrapped. Reid used the decades-long controversy to bolster his image back home as a fighter standing up to moneyed interests in Washington that wanted to turn Nevada into a dumping ground. ", " Despite a moderate record and a much more liberal Democratic Caucus, Reid secured the minority whip job in 1999. He was now in the leadership, and seemingly never left the Senate floor. His relationship with Daschle was not a close personal friendship, to say the least, during their time in the Senate. And last year they had a serious falling out over strategy in a Senate race in Daschle\u2019s home state of South Dakota. ", " In 2001, when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords jumped to the Democrats from the GOP, thrusting the Democrats into the majority, Reid got a lot of the credit for his patient, behind-the-scenes wooing of his colleague. Democrats jokingly referred to him as the \u201cJeffords whisperer.\u201d ", " and ", " Reid continued to do the grunt work needed to move up in leadership, and when Daschle was knocked off by Republican John Thune in November 2004, Reid stepped in to fill the void. Along with Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on the House side, Reid would frequently torment then-President George W. Bush. ", " Flashes of Reid\u2019s infamous temper \u2014 and his tendency for verbal gaffes, a noteworthy trait for a man with such self-control \u2014landed him in trouble on several occasions. \u201cThe man\u2019s father is a wonderful human being. I think this guy is a loser,\u201d Reid said of the president in May 2005, a statement for which he later apologized. ", " By 2006, with the Iraq War undermining Bush\u2019s popularity, Democrats took the Senate in a romp. Reid finally became majority leader, completing a stunning rise to power. In 2008, with Barack Obama sailing to the White House, Democrats won a filibuster-proof majority, making Reid the most dominant Senate Democrat in decades. ", " With Obama in the Oval Office, Reid and Pelosi pushed through an ambitious agenda on Capitol Hill, including the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare; a $787 billion stimulus package; and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill.

", " Reid was also able to shepherd several of Obama\u2019s key nominations through the Senate, including two Supreme Court justices and dozens of federal judges.

Republicans won seats in 2010 and Reid himself barely won reelection, surviving only after Republicans nominated an extremely conservative candidate, Sharron Angle, to run against him. ", " In 2012, despite a bad election map, Senate Democrats held on to the majority. But by 2014, with Obama\u2019s poll numbers sliding, the eight-year Senate Democratic majority was swept away. While Reid kept his post as party leader, moderates wanted a bigger say in running the Democratic Caucus, and liberal star Elizabeth Warren was given a seat at the leadership table. ", "\n  ", " ", " In the months leading up to the November wipeout, Reid had triggered the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d ending the 60-vote threshold for nominations. The move infuriated Republicans and shocked Senate purists, yet Reid said it had to be done in order to get Obama\u2019s nominees through a bitterly partisan Senate. ", " Some senators compared Reid to a tyrant or dictator, but he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cIf that\u2019s the worst thing anyone says about me, that I ruled the Senate with an iron fist, I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d Reid told NPR. ", " In the early months of this year, there were growing signs Reid would retire, despite his public protestations to the contrary. He suffered a harrowing exercise injury that nearly blinded him in one eye. Landra Reid has survived a bout with breast cancer, and their daughter also had a health scare. ", " The Democratic Caucus, while still respectful and loyal, was tired of Reid as well. It was clear to many Democrats that the 114th Congress would be his last as party leader. Reid has groomed Chuck Schumer of New York as his replacement. Hours after he announced his retirement Friday, Reid endorsed Schumer to succeed him as Democratic leader.

Netanyahu\u2019s visit to Washington was neither the triumph he expected nor the disaster forecast by opponents of the visit. Indeed, the visit shed no new light on the supposedly central issue of the day: the state of play in the Iran negotiations. ", " Netanyahu\u2019s big bet on reversing the course of the Iran negotiations apparently did not succeed, although it is still unclear \u2014 as it was when Netanyahu first conceived this trip \u2014 whether the talks will reach fruition. What is clear is that Netanyahu changed few minds, either in Congress or among the public. Everyone is skeptical of Iran and its intentions, and everyone wants a tightly-knit set of obligations and safeguards that try to ensure that Iran will not be able to build a nuclear weapon. However, the divide remains as to where to draw the line. ", "Story Continued Below", " Netanyahu also provided no alternative proposal. Continued pressure and sanctions sound alluring, except for the fact that if the United States causes the negotiations to fail, Russia and China will push to unravel the international sanctions. The current sanctions \u2013 which work because they have bite \u2013 were only agreed to by the U.N. Security Council after the Obama administration decided to negotiate while Iran appeared to refuse to compromise. Without a good faith effort by the United States to conclude the negotiations, sanctions will simply slip away. ", " The alternative to sanctions is military action, which has always been Netanyahu\u2019s preferred course of action, even if he did not specify it during his public remarks in Washington. There are those who believe that unilateral Israeli military action would set back the Iranian nuclear program for several years, albeit at the cost of increased terrorism. But if a negotiated agreement, designed to last for ten years, is not sufficiently attractive to Netanyahu, why would a setback of fewer than ten years be more attractive? A military strike will destroy some physical facilities, but it certainly won\u2019t impact Iranian knowhow, and it might just impel the Iranians to unify ranks behind a serious, clandestine breakout program. Is this what Netanyahu has in mind? ", " Despite Netanyahu\u2019s protestations of affinity for the United States and his assertion that his speech meant no disrespect for President Obama, the fact is that in agreeing to speak before Congress without the president\u2019s knowledge or invitation Netanyahu demonstrated substantial disrespect for Obama personally and for the institution of the U.S. presidency. While some argue that the fabric of American-Israeli ties will remain strong notwithstanding the tensions at the top, it defies reason for an Israeli prime minister to undermine a sitting president who has almost two years left in office and to court a Republican-held Congress when the U.S.-Israel relationship has been so carefully built by a bipartisan coalition over the years . ", " We are left wondering what Netanyahu\u2019s thinking is \u2013 either he cares only about his own political future and is ready to risk his country\u2019s relationship with its most important ally for this self-serving gain, or he has another plan that he hasn\u2019t explained \u2013 and which is not apparent because on the face of it would not pass the smell test. Perhaps he just feels that the relationship will weather his shenanigans so they are worth pulling; in the middle of the run-up to Netanyahu\u2019s visit, the press reported Israel\u2019s request for another $300 million in military assistance. Is Netanyahu blind to the irony of this, or has his arrogance reached a point where he assumes Israel will ask and the United States will simply say yes? ", " It is also not clear what role Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, played in conceiving this visit. What is clear is that Dermer\u2019s ability to function as the Israeli ambassador is now severely weakened, perhaps even fatally so. Israeli prime ministers often have a personal emissary in Washington, a close confidant apart from the ambassador whose role is to convey the prime minister\u2019s personal views rather than the formal position of the Israeli government. Dermer has conflated these two functions, acting more as a personal envoy than as an ambassador. In doing so, he has lost touch with a large segment of Americans \u2013 including a majority of the Jewish community that votes for the Democrats. Ambassadors are an expendable lot \u2013 I know from experience \u2013 and Dermer has now outlived his usefulness as Israel\u2019s envoy to the United States. ", " The unknown and perhaps unknowable part of this drama is the behind the scenes role likely played by Netanyahu\u2019s prime U.S. funder and supporter, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. Adelson\u2019s money maneuvers in American politics are a matter of public record, and those activities \u2013 along with the perverse role played by other big money people \u2013 have corrupted U.S. politics. The Israelis should learn from our mistakes \u2013 be forewarned about the American money now flowing freely to Israeli politicians and parties, and it is na\u00efve to believe that this money comes without strings. Given Adelson\u2019s reported antipathy toward Obama personally, it is entirely conceivable that the Boehner-Netanyahu gambit was in fact stimulated or at least supported wholeheartedly by Adelson. If true, this would be bad news for both countries. ", " Perhaps after all is said and done, Netanyahu\u2019s visit to America helped shed light on some important fissures taking place that need to be mended quickly. The visit was \u2013 in reality \u2013 an effort by politicians in both the United States and Israel to shake up their respective domestic politics. But in the end what we are left with is outstanding questions about the U.S.-Israeli relationship. I hope it will remain strong. It should remain strong. But we need to find a way to get domestic politics out of the equation \u2013 on both sides \u2013 and revive our history of shared support.

Barack Obama over Clinton in 2008, and Leonard. ", " Run Warren Run, the campaign jointly operated by liberal groups MoveOn and Democracy for America, will also unveil an op-ed by Javier Valdes, secretary of the Working Families Party in New York and a leader of a progressive political committee focused on Hispanics, encouraging Warren to run for the sake of spurring a debate about \u201cracial and immigrant justice.\u201d ", " A significant group of liberal activists, academics and groups \u2014 including New York\u2019s Working Families Party and The Boston Globe\u2019s editorial board \u2014 have lined up behind the efforts to draft Warren, often citing the importance of a competitive primary rather than any animus toward Clinton. But many progressives regard the presumptive front-runner as being too close to Wall Street. They believe Warren, an antagonist of big banks, represents an attractive alternative despite her repeated insistence that she will not run. At the very least, they expect she could help pull Clinton farther to the political left. ", " The addition of Cohen to the pro-Warren group is sure to complicate organized labor\u2019s role in the nominating process. Most labor leaders have yet to weigh in, but many have a long history with Clinton and some have appeared with her at recent events. ", " Just last week, Clinton spoke on a panel in Washington co-sponsored by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which endorsed her early in her failed bid for the 2008 nomination. She sat next to AFSCME President Lee Saunders, and close by the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 Randi Weingarten. ", " With Clinton enjoying large leads in early state and national polls, any serious competitor on the left would have considerable ground to make up. ", " Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley appears to be positioning himself as the primary liberal Clinton alternative in the Democratic field, recently stepping up his implied criticisms of the former secretary of state. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, could also challenge Clinton from the left, but it is unclear whether he would run as a Democrat.\u00a0 ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

It served as the headquarters of the former Miami News and then, after the newspaper vacated the building, became a U.S. processing facility that welcomed Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castro\u2019s government after he seized power in 1959.

Since then, Rubio\u2019s has jettisoned talk of reviving the bill and blames President Barack Obama for the current stalemate. When asked on \u201cThe Five\u201d about being perceived as \u201csoft on immigration,\u201d Rubio repeated his talking points and steered clear of mentioning that the GOP-controlled U.S. House refused to take up the issue.

What we have today is not sustainable. And No. 2: we can\u2019t do it all at once. Especially because of the two executive orders. The latest one in particular. The American people will not support doing anything further on immigration until first they believe illegal immigration in the future is under control. If that happens, I think people are willing to be very reasonable about what we do with those who are here now that have been here for a long time and have not otherwise violated our laws.
