Or, for Senate Democrats, look to the two top states in which the party will play defense in 2016 \u2014 Nevada and Colorado \u2014 where the dominance of Las Vegas-based Clark County and the diversifying Denver suburbs hold the keys to reelection for Sens.

", " And in any case, the composition of the national electorate continues to change to the benefit of a party that\u2019s lenient on immigration, legal or otherwise. The presidential vote has grown steadily less white and steadily more Hispanic over the past two decades. In 1992, 87 percent of presidential voters were white, while 2 percent were Hispanic. Twenty years later, white voters represented 72 percent of the electorate, while 10 percent were Hispanic (13 percent were black and 3 percent Asian). ", " So while a national election polarized around border issues might once have spelled doom for Democrats, the party believes the basic lines of national politics have changed to the point where something like the opposite is true. ", " William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who has studied what he calls a \u201ccultural generation gap\u201d on diversity and immigration, said Obama\u2019s orders represented a decisive wager on the newly emerging electorate.

Republicans have already lurched right this year on immigration, voting to end Obama\u2019s policy of suspending deportations for undocumented minors. Digging in against the substance of this week\u2019s orders, Garin said, will ultimately put Republicans on the wrong side of a debate about whether the government should deport millions of Latinos from the country. ", " \u201cThe polling is very clear that even among voters who have reservations about executive power, there is support for the underlying policy,\u201d said Garin, an adviser to the 2012 Obama super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cOne of the impacts of the president\u2019s action is that Republicans will have moved from a policy of self-deportation, in Mitt Romney\u2019s terms from 2012, to a policy of actual deportation. That\u2019s the fundamental meaning of their opposition to what Obama is doing.\u201d ", "\n  ", " ", " There\u2019s precedent for eruptions of border-hawk ire followed by energetic mobilization among Latino voters and progressive allies. Polls throughout the 2010 midterm election showed strong support for enforcement crackdowns like the one Arizona pioneered that year, with a law allowing law enforcement officers to check the citizenship status of persons they detain. It was taken by some as a warning sign for Democrats intent on pursuing comprehensive reform. ", " But two years later, public polling in swing states such as Ohio and Florida showed voters supportive of an apparently contradictory Obama decision to defer deportations for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors. That executive action was credited with helping re-energize the president\u2019s campaign and driving a spike in Latino turnout. Nevada legislator Lucy Flores, who just lost a race for lieutenant governor, said the absence of a motivator like that \u2014 indeed, Obama\u2019s explicit decision to postpone his executive actions \u2014 hurt Hispanic turnout this year. ", " \u201cI wish this wasn\u2019t a partisan thing, but it is,\u201d she said, forecasting that this week\u2019s announcement would help reelect Harry Reid in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s very apparent that Democrats have been leading the way on this issue \u2026 Republicans are not doing anything.\u201d ", " Ben Monterroso, executive director of the advocacy group Mi Familia Vota, put it in starker terms than that.

John McCain and Lindsey Graham \u2014 were working with senators from both parties to draft an immigration bill, top Rubio hands flatly warned the Florida freshman not to go there. The advisers feared nothing would be worse for his chances in a potential presidential campaign than being associated with \u201camnesty\u201d for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. ", " Rubio didn\u2019t take the advice. And two years later, immigration remains the freshman senator\u2019s No. 1 liability in his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination \u2014 though not necessarily the deal breaker it appeared to be after the reform effort Rubio helped shepherd to passage in the Senate hit a brick wall in the House. ", " \u201cEverybody likes Marco Rubio,\u201d said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated commentator. But \u201cI still don\u2019t hear his name from conservatives at all, and I think the Gang of Eight\u201d \u2014 the bipartisan group of senators that pushed the most sweeping immigration overhaul in a generation \u2014 \u201chas a lot to do with that.\u201d ", " Even so, the political damage to Rubio has clearly subsided over time, in no small part due to Rubio\u2019s repeated disavowal of the entire reform exercise. In the days ahead of his presidential campaign launch in Miami Monday evening, some critics on the tea party right concede he has resuscitated himself politically, though the true effect may not be apparent until much deeper into the 2016 primary season. ", " \u201cWhat I think everyone over here underestimated is how difficult it is to pass massive pieces of legislation on any subject \u2014 not just immigration \u2014 given the rightful distrust the people have about the federal government,\u201d Rubio said in a recent interview in the Capitol. ", " Said Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots: \u201cI think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don\u2019t do: He evaluated what went wrong \u2026 [and] is working to make sure he doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.\u201d ", " Still, even if immigration won\u2019t be a central message of his presidential campaign, it will be an inescapable part of his record and his own personal narrative. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio announced his presidential run at the Freedom Tower in Miami \u2014 an Ellis Island of the South that served as a welcoming point for Cuban exiles into America. ", " The issue is also bound to be re-litigated by his opponents and voters, as it has during early appearances this year at a New Hampshire town hall and Iowa book signing. When pressed on the matter on the campaign trail, Rubio plans to tell voters that the comprehensive bill he co-authored will never pass Congress. ", " In his latest book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio argues that the approach he took in 2013 on immigration \u2014 one single bill to reform the entire system \u2014 was \u201csimply not realistic.\u201d He can assert that, Rubio says, because he knows of the experience firsthand. ", " \u201cEvery massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,\u201d Rubio said in the interview. ", " Instead, Rubio is renewing an argument he made originally that Congress should take up immigration reform in pieces, starting with proposals that Republicans largely support such as enforcement at the southern border, a mandatory electronic system to verify the legal status of employees and a new method to track people who overstay their visas. He\u2019ll argue that deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally is improbable, and call for an onerous series of steps to allow some to stay in the country. And a President Rubio would only entertain that possibility of citizenship after a enforcement-minded immigration laws are enacted first. ", " Such talk \u2014 and his decision to back away away from his own bill \u2014 seem to have alleviated some concern on the right that Rubio is not another McCain or Graham. ", " Yet it\u2019s also opened him to charges that the GOP lawmaker flip-flopped on the issue when the political temperature got too hot \u2013 simply to pander to the base of the party, and potentially leaving himself vulnerable to Latino voters in a general election. ", " In June 2013, the same month that his immigration bill passed the Senate, a ", " showed that his \u201cstrongly favorable\u201d ratings among Republicans had tumbled by 11 points since the previous August. ", " Rubio began to make amends with conservatives. Immediately after the bill passed the chamber, he shifted his attention to a range of economic reforms and other matters. He refused to call on the GOP-led House to pass the Senate bill, even as the other seven co-authors planned an aggressive public pressure campaign on House Republicans. ", " Rubio blamed President Barack Obama for scuttling the bill\u2019s chances, saying no conservative trusts the White House to implement the border control provisions. Republicans in the House agreed. ", " His shift to the right didn\u2019t stop there. At the height of last summer\u2019s border crisis, Rubio called for the 2012 Obama administration program that halts deportations of young undocumented immigrants \u2014 an initiative highly popular with Latinos \u2014 to eventually end. ", " Critics say his handling of immigration feeds the perception that Rubio lacks any significant legislative accomplishments in his short time in the Senate. And immigration activists who were once impressed with Rubio for taking on the politically fraught task of writing a reform bill now see him as a sell-out. ", "MICHAEL GRUNWALD and ", " \u201cEvery time he gets on his knees and begs for forgiveness from the nativist right in the GOP, I cringe,\u201d said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate who leads America\u2019s Voice, a left-leaning, pro-reform group. \u201cHe will always be known as the guy who stood up for something he seemed to believe in and backed down when it was politically convenient to do so.\u201d ", " It\u2019s unclear how Rubio would fare among Latino voters if he were to win the GOP nomination. The polling firm Latino Decisions found in a November survey of Latino voters that Rubio is viewed favorably by 31 percent of Latinos vs. 36 percent who saw him unfavorably. About one-third of those voters had not heard of Rubio, or had any opinion on the senator. ", " Despite concerns for some on the right, public polls show the senator still has a serious chance to win a wide-open race. A ", " from March showed that 56 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Rubio \u2014 a higher figure than received by any other of the 13 GOP contenders listed by the poll. ", " Perhaps that\u2019s because Rubio has moved to ensure he\u2019s not identified strictly with the immigration issue. He\u2019s been laying out economic reform ideas, from making higher education more affordable to helping narrow the income gap. At the same time, he has maintained his staunchly conservative views on social issues and foreign policy. ", " \u201cI\u2019m struck by how much he has recovered,\u201d said Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, who two years ago ", " to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the Gang of Eight. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on it, but there do seem to be some politicians whom lots of voters want to like and are eager to forgive for their mistakes,\u201d Kristol said, citing Ronald Reagan as an example. \u201cOthers who are less likable get held to a stricter standard. So Rubio\u2019s apparent comeback over the last couple of years may indicate a kind of underlying strength there that one might not have expected.\u201d ", " Yet, Rubio is still likely to be the left of the likes of Ted Cruz when it comes to immigration reform. ", " In \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d Rubio said he would address immigrants already here illegally once Congress has passed enforcement proposals and turned the current legal immigration system into one based on merit and economic considerations, not family ties. ", " At that point, he said he would institute a system to register those here illegally, deporting ones who have committed serious crimes or who have not been in the United States long enough. Undocumented immigrants who pay a fine, learn English and undergo background checks could then obtain a temporary legal status, something they would have to hold for at least 10 years before applying for permanent residence. ", " Rubio said he would not create a so-called special pathway, meaning a way to obtain citizenship that isn\u2019t afforded to other immigrants. That highly contentious provision \u2014 to provide a pathway to citizenship \u2014 was included in the Gang of Eight proposal. ", " \u201cHe not going to run away from it, he\u2019s going to talk about it,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership, a group that advocates for conservative causes among Latinos. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to say that it\u2019s important to deal with the issue.\u201d ", " Aguilar, who has lobbied GOP lawmakers on immigration reform, said Rubio should have tried harder to recruit other conservative Republicans to the Gang of Eight so he wasn\u2019t the sole emissary charged with selling the bill to the right. One target might have been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was considered part of the group in its early stages.

Instead, the senator\u2019s team sees four brackets in the GOP primary field: the tea party, evangelicals, libertarians and establishment Republicans. The goal, they explain, is to establish Cruz as the first choice of tea partyers and become at least the second choice of evangelicals. \n ", " ", " Winning over the establishment \u2014 which still blames him for the federal government shutdown of 2013 \u2014 and libertarians \u2014 who remain relatively loyal to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 will be very tough, Cruz strategists concede. The goal is to become the main conservative alternative to whoever emerges as the establishment candidate, whether that\u2019s the former Florida governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \n ", " ", " \u201cWe believe we have a clear path to victory and have the ability to raise the money to get our message out,\u201d said Cruz senior adviser Jason Miller. \u201cSo we\u2019re full steam ahead.\u201d \n ", " ", " Cruz undeniably enters this contest as a dark horse. Just two of 50 Iowans surveyed in The POLITICO Caucus \u2014 a weekly focus group of the most plugged-in people in the two states that kick off the nominating process \u2014 think he would win the caucuses if they were held this week. None of the insiders in New Hampshire believe he\u2019d win the primary if it was this week. He\u2019s often low in the pack in early polling, though that is not worth much at this stage. \n ", " ", " He sees himself in the mold of Ronald Reagan circa 1979, or perhaps 1975, in that he is not taken seriously by Washington Republicans but that he appeals to independents and other nontraditional voters who like the way he speaks truth to power and never goes along to get along. \n ", " ", " The party establishment sees Cruz as more akin to George McGovern in 1972, someone on the extreme fringe who is congenitally unable to compromise and could never win a general election. They point to ", " to argue that he\u2019s fundamentally unserious. They call the 2013 government shutdown a PR mess for the party, though Cruz likes to note that Republicans took control of the Senate just 13 months later. \n ", " ", " Anger ", " at Cruz in the GOP conference this past December when he forced a weekend session in an unsuccessful attempt to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration. His own colleagues publicly criticized him for not being strategic and for making everyone\u2019s weekend \u201cmiserable.\u201d \n ", " ", " Texas\u2019 senior senator, John Cornyn, said Monday that he will stay neutral and has ", " to endorse Cruz, who declined to endorse Cornyn in his own GOP primary last year. \n ", " ", " But as Hillary Clinton looks weaker and more beatable, because of the email problems and a host of other scandals, Cruz hopes that the Republican base begins to coalesce behind someone like him. If they think that anyone can beat Clinton, the thinking goes, why not back the most outspoken conservative? \n ", " ", " Cruz\u2019s advisers believe he can outmaneuver Walker and Paul in the early states. The sense within Cruz\u2019s team is that he\u2019s more ready for prime time and more polished on the stump than other rivals. \n ", " ", " Since entering the Senate two years ago, the Texan has positioned himself to be the most ideologically pure candidate in the wide-open Republican presidential field. This has made him enemies but it\u2019s also earned him acolytes. \n ", " ", " Cruz has drawn large crowds at his frequent events in the early states. And he was the only top-tier candidate who was willing to go to an Iowa Agriculture Summit earlier this month sponsored by the ethanol industry and declare his unapologetic opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires that a certain percentage of gasoline come from renewable sources. \n ", " ", " Any realistic path to the nomination requires Cruz to win or place second in the Iowa caucuses, which has a lower turnout than a primary and thus gives more power to activists who tend to sympathize with Cruz. \n ", " ", " Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Iowa GOP, said Cruz\u2019s message will appeal to a chunk of base voters and he could win if he turns out enough previous caucus-goers. \n ", " ", " \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to get creative like a Jeb Bush or Chris Christie does,\u201d said Robinson, who is neutral. \u201cThe only problem is that you have two former caucus winners who you have to overtake: Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum.\u201d \n ", " ", " Robinson said Cruz has a difficult needle to thread as he tries to appeal to a swatch of anti-establishment voters, many of whom also care deeply about backing someone who can actually win. \n ", " ", "\n  ", " ", " \u201cThis \u2018fighter\u2019 brand that he embraces, while it does really appeal to activists and tea party people, it actually works against him when it comes to an electability argument,\u201d Robinson added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he has \u2018accomplishments\u2019 as an elected official.\u201d \n ", " ", " Cruz got a good crowd in New Hampshire the weekend before last, but he will have a harder time winning in the Granite State because independents are allowed to vote in the GOP primary. If Clinton has no credible challenger, voters from the center-left could cast ballots in the Republican contest. \n ", " ", " South Carolina, the first state in the South with a primary, could be friendly terrain for Cruz if he gets traction out of the first states. \n ", " ", " But if he were to win one of the first three states, he could be off to the races. The first day of multiple primaries, on March 1, is mostly focused on conservative Southern states where Cruz could play well and rack up a good chunk of delegates, which will be allocated proportionally. His challenge in this scenario would be to survive beyond March 15, when states are allowed to begin awarding all of their delegates to whoever wins. \n ", " ", " To have staying power past March 15, Cruz would need enough cash to run a national campaign. To show his fundraising prowess, Cruz will launch a 10-city fundraising tour Monday. The goal is to raise at least $1 million over the coming week and to make progress toward the campaign\u2019s goal of raking in at least $40 million over the course of the primary campaign. \n ", " ", " Cruz already has assembled an inner-circle of campaign talent. Besides Miller, a South Carolina expert who helped plot Mark Sanford\u2019s against-the-odds comeback, Cruz has longtime chief strategist Jason Johnson; Jeff Roe of Axiom Strategies, who worked for Rick Perry\u2019s 2012 campaign and did voter identification for Huckabee in 2008; and Rick Tyler, who ran the Newt Gingrich super PAC in 2012. Chris Wilson and Chris Perkins of Wilson Perkins Allen are his pollsters. \n ", " ", " One big question that veteran strategists ask quietly is whether Cruz can convert large crowds that show up for his speeches into grass-roots support that will mobilize for him. He gives great stump speeches, but he can seem very introverted and disconnected one-on-one. \n ", " ", " The other big question after Cruz\u2019s announcement at Liberty University is whether his play for evangelicals risks turning off some tea partyers. \n ", " ", " and ", " Some key backers of Santorum and Huckabee question Cruz\u2019s authenticity on social issues. They ask: What conservative victory has Cruz actually led on social issues? Santorum and Huckabee both can point to accomplishments and decades of being outspoken on issues like abortion. \n ", " ", " An Iowa Republican strategist, who is currently unaffiliated with a campaign, said it will be tough for Cruz to win the caucuses. He said it is obvious that he\u2019s trying to put himself in the middle of the three-legged stool that Reagan used to talk about, which includes fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and national security hawks. But the strategist argued that Cruz will never be able to become \u201cthe most evangelical\u201d candidate in the field. \n ", " ", " \u201cIf this is the hill he goes and dies on \u2026 that isn\u2019t going to be fertile enough for him to win,\u201d he said. \n ", " ", " Cruz aides note that he has been outspoken in his opposition to abortion and recognizing gay marriage, even as the GOP establishment has become increasingly eager to move beyond the marriage issue. He also made efforts to appeal to the religious right during his guerrilla-style 2012 Senate primary challenge to the front-runner, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. \n ", " ", " The speech at Liberty, the college founded by a Southern Baptist icon, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, included heavy doses of Cruz\u2019s personal narrative, including a powerful story about his alcoholic father abandoning his family when the senator was a child but returning home after finding God. \n ", " ", " \u201cI think Huckabee and Santorum will have a hard time getting votes beyond evangelicals,\u201d said Iowa social conservative activist Sam Clovis, who backed Santorum in 2012 but is uncommitted now. \u201cCruz is a fresh face. In the estimate of some hard-core activists in the state, he\u2019s been the one who has held the line the most among Republicans and has been the most visible about it.\u201d \n ", " ", " \u201cThere are certainly some who would find him unelectable,\u201d Clovis added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say most would; I would say some.\u201d \n ", " ", " Recognizing this liability, Cruz tested out an uplifting message with Monday\u2019s speech. His goal as the first candidate out of the gate is to appear as less of a shadowy figure and become more likable, endearing him to those outside his tea party base. \n ", " ", " \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m ready to stand with you to help lead the fight.\u201d \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

But if you ask Republican campaign pollsters and other political consultants, it\u2019s just a mirage, nothing more than a reflection of faulty public polling about how actual Republican primary voters feel about Trump and the other candidates. ", " \u201cSuch junk,\u201d ", " B.J. Martino, a pollster on Scott Walker\u2019s presidential campaign, responding to ", " in Iowa and New Hampshire, two of three surveys released Sunday that showed Trump at or near the top of the pack. The polls showed Trump leading in New Hampshire and running neck-and-neck with Walker in Iowa, where the Wisconsin governor has been the early favorite. ", "Story Continued Below", " The problem, Republican political professionals say, is that Trump\u2019s rise to the top has been driven by intense media coverage of his often circus-like campaign. That media attention, some Republicans gripe, causes his poll numbers to rise \u2014 which, in turn, leads to more media attention. ", " But polling methodology, these critics argue, is also skewing the numbers. Public surveys are often conducted by random-digit dialing: randomly generating and dialing telephone numbers on both landlines and cell phones. Private polls, like the ones conducted for political campaigns, start with lists of voters. While the respondents are still randomly selected from this pool, using voter-registration data allows pollsters to impose other controls on the sample, such as calling only those with a history of voting in lower-turnout elections, like primaries or off-year races. ", " That, campaign pollsters say, screens out people who would say they are going to vote but are less likely to cast ballots. The public polls, on the other hand, include those voters. ", " There are other key differences between the media and private polls. The national public polling in the Republican primary includes all those who self-identify as registered Republicans and independents who lean Republican. But the rules for who gets to vote in primaries differ from state to state: some states have primaries that are closed to voters who aren\u2019t registered with the party, such as Florida. Others, like New Hampshire and South Carolina, allow independents to vote in one party\u2019s primary election. (And some other states, like Virginia, don\u2019t have party registration at all.) ", " In recent national polls, Trump performs as well or better among self-identified Republican-leaning independents \u2014 the kind of voters who might be overrepresented in public polls \u2014 than those who identify as committed Republicans. That\u2019s why GOP campaign professionals are telling anyone who will listen that the polls are overestimating Trump\u2019s appeal among the small group of voters who will eventually participate in the party\u2019s nominating process. ", " \u201cIowa Republican caucus goers are roughly 10% of registered voters in the state,\u201d Martino said in a follow-up ", ". \u201cNBC/Marist\u2019s poll? 37% of registered voters.\u201d ", " With national polling serving as the most important part of the criteria for participation in the first two televised GOP debates, the methodology issue is suddenly front and center. Fox News Channel, which is hosting the first debate next week, has said only the top 10 candidates in an average of national public polls will be invited. ", " \u201cNormally these polls would be great entertainment value,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, the co-founder of Echelon Insights, a GOP analytics firm. \u201cThe problem is we\u2019re using this to determine who gets into the debates.\u201d ", " Media pollsters defend their work. Random-digit dialing is the best way to achieve a true random sample, they say, and it\u2019s too early for the horse-race numbers to be predictive of the election result. ", " The GOP primary match-ups in the NBC News/Marist polls, for example, included voters who said they were registered Republicans and independents who said they preferred to vote in the GOP caucus or primary. Neither voters\u2019 past turnout performance nor their stated likelihood to vote this time was used to screen out those who were unlikely to vote. ", " \u201cWhat we are doing is we are adhering to the laws in each of the states,\u201d said Barbara Carvalho, the director of the Marist poll. \u201cOur criteria are based on who potentially may participate in each of the states.\u201d ", " But, to some GOP campaign professionals, that\u2019s far too inclusive. ", " \u201cYou have an Iowa poll in which 37 percent of the people get screened in as potential caucusgoers,\u201d said Ruffini, referring to the NBC News/Marist poll. ", " Fewer than 6 percent of registered voters attended the 2012 Iowa GOP caucusgoers, Ruffini wrote in a detailed ", " of public polling in a post on the website Medium. \u201cThis year, the effect of including low-propensity voters in primary polls may be especially great because of a certain mega-celebrity who starts with near total name recognition: Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. ", " Sunday wasn\u2019t the first instance of Republican criticism of the public 2016 presidential polling. POLITICO reported earlier this month that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s pollster, Chris Wilson, sent a letter to a number of other campaigns asking them to join him in proposing strict standards for Fox News to use in selecting the polls that would comprise the debate average. Those recommendations included sample sizes of at least 1,000 voters and including only those voters who say they intend to cast ballots in their state\u2019s nominating contest. ", " None of the public polls have come close to meeting those criteria. Of the last five public polls conducted by live interviewers \u2014 Fox News\u2019 apparent standard for inclusion \u2014 no poll surveyed more than 419 Republican voters. ", " That\u2019s because the Republican primary is being tacked onto surveys of all Americans, which ask about the presidential race, among other issues. When a campaign is polling for a specific election, they sample voters specifically for that race. ", " \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do both the primary and the general election,\u201d Ruffini said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t really do both well in a single survey. The reality is that maybe 10 percent of the voting-age population will end up voting in the Republican primary.\u201d ", " For years, public pollsters have urged observers to look beyond the horse-race numbers in their poll \u2014 arguing that the purpose of the survey isn\u2019t to predict the election, but to shed light on what voters think and what\u2019s driving their decisions. That\u2019s one reason some pollsters are lamenting the role that has been thrust upon them by news organizations that are using polling performance to whittle down the GOP debate field. ", " \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be measuring that which is occurring,\u201d said Marist Institute for Public Opinion director Lee Miringoff. \u201cBy making the poll numbers determine eligibility to get into the debate, the polls are actually shaping candidate behavior. They are just trying to create a surge to get into the debate. That\u2019s not just putting the cart before the horse.

", " In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Rubio alleged that President Barack Obama has flinched from a dangerous world and argued for \u201cAmerican strength [as] a means of preventing war, not promoting it.\u201d ", "Story Continued Below", " But he also said that, given the benefit of hindsight about flawed intelligence, he would not have supported invading Iraq in 2003. (\u201cNot only would I not have been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it,\u201d Rubio said.) That set up a contrast with Jeb Bush, who equivocated on the question this week. ", " Rubio\u2019s Iraq comments followed a 20-minute address designed to showcase his credentials as a foreign policy savant, an image he has cultivated since his arrival in Washington just over four years ago. Rubio came to the Senate from the Florida Legislature with no national security experience beyond a keen interest in Cuba and a boyhood fascination with the military. ", " Since then, he has worked assiduously to build his national security credentials and expertise, particularly after a foray into immigration reform became a political quagmire. Aides believe that none of his Republican rivals can match his foreign policy savvy, a point implicit in his willingness to field unscripted questions from CFR members after his speech. ", " \u201cI actually traveled to Libya after the fall of Gadhafi,\u201d Rubio said casually in response to one questioner. That is a preview of things to come on the campaign trail, where Rubio is sure to draw from overseas trips, classified briefings and meetings with foreign leaders unavailable to most of his GOP rivals. ", " Rubio\u2019s critics scoff at his claim to be a foreign policy heavyweight, noting that Obama was also a first-term senator who came from a state legislature. Supporters of his rivals in statehouses say that executive experience is more important in the Oval Office than knowing the difference between Dubai and Doha. Rubio insists he is more qualified than Obama was when he first ran, a claim the website PolitiFact recently ", " \u201chalf true.\u201d ", " The political stakes are high. Polls show that national security has soared to the top of the list of issues that concern Republican primary voters. A February Pew poll found that voters trust Republicans over Democrats on foreign policy by a margin of 13 points \u2014 the first time in the Obama era that Pew found a GOP advantage on the issue. ", " For now, Rubio appears to be chasing conservative primary voters \u2014 and big-money donors \u2014 with increasingly hawkish rhetoric. On Wednesday, he stressed the need for a more robust defense budget and said Obama\u2019s hoped-for nuclear deal with Iran would make war \u201ceven more likely.\u201d ", " A few days earlier, Rubio explained his policy toward terrorists by quoting Liam Neeson\u2019s character from the 2008 thriller \u201cTaken\u201d: \u201c\u2018We will look for you, we will find you, and we will kill you.\u201d ", " Behind the sound bites, Rubio\u2019s supporters say, is a nuanced understanding of the world developed through focused hard work \u2014 and boyhood dreams. In his 2012 memoir, Rubio writes that his Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 grandfather taught him about the importance of American power against fascism and communism. The young Rubio once aspired to lead an exile army to overthrow Fidel Castro and \u201cbecome president of a free Cuba.\u201d In fifth grade, Rubio wrote a paper hailing Ronald Reagan\u2019s military budget. ", " After arriving in Washington, Rubio followed more adult pursuits \u2014 grabbing seats on the Senate\u2019s foreign relations and intelligence committees. The latter assignment gave him access to classified briefings on issues like terrorism, electronic surveillance and Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cI\u2019m privy to the most sensitive information available to the U.S. government,\u201d Rubio told The Des Moines Register last month. ", " He has also racked up more frequent-flier miles than most of rivals and many Senate colleagues, traveling to 15 countries over the past four years. ", " During a February 2013 trip to the Middle East, soon after he delivered the GOP response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 who toasted Rubio with a water bottle, in a joking nod to Rubio\u2019s famously awkward sip of water during a national TV appearance days earlier. ", " Rubio had an unlikely adviser early on: John Kerry. Then the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry advised his younger colleague that his public profile was sufficiently high \u2014 Rubio appeared on the cover of Time magazine in February 2013 as \u201cThe Republican Savior\u201d \u2014 that he no longer needed to join crowded congressional delegations abroad. Kerry said that Rubio could secure solo meetings with top foreign leaders, unlike many of his colleagues, and should take advantage of the ability to travel on his own. ", " Rubio took the advice, taking solo trips in 2012 and 2013 to destinations including Haiti, Colombia and Japan, meeting heads of state in each. ", " Since 2013, a far more substantive adviser has been Jamie Fly, a former nonproliferation aide in George W. Bush\u2019s White House and Pentagon with strong ties to the party\u2019s neoconservative wing. Before joining Rubio\u2019s staff, Fly had been executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a think tank whose founders include the prominent conservative hawks Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan. ", " Rubio\u2019s office won\u2019t divulge the names of other outside advisers, although aides have said in the past that he has consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Bush White House national security aide and Middle East expert Elliott Abrams.

In an interview with POLITICO, the South Carolina senator made clear that he plans to talk in sober detail about the need to overhaul the social safety net and reform the immigration system to allow foreign workers into the United States. He\u2019s intending to look Republican primary voters in the eye and tell them the GOP needs to \u2014 yes \u2014 cut deals with Democrats if it wants to survive as a party.

", " It\u2019s not the usual red meat that GOP candidates throw to the crowd \u2014 though Graham will have plenty of those zingers, particularly when it comes to his hawkish views on national defense. But the South Carolina Republican plans to tell voters what they ", "want to hear, something his advisers believe will go a long way in selling himself as an authentic, tell-it-like-it-is candidate.

And he doesn\u2019t have the bona fides with the conservative base and talk radio that Cruz has. ", " Polling shows Graham at rock bottom among all the potential contenders in a very crowded field. ", " Graham, who has served in Congress since 1995 and is an attorney in the Air Force Reserve, is not without a wide range of votes that add to his baggage headed into 2016. He voted for both of President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees. He backs Loretta Lynch to be attorney general. He believes climate change is real and that the federal government should do something about it. He\u2019s open to a Simpson-Bowles-type approach to rein in big deficits, something that would raise tax revenues. And he was an architect of the comprehensive immigration bill, something the right wing of his party despises. ", " Graham is not a candidate yet, but he is increasingly sounding like one. He\u2019s traveled to early states like Iowa and New Hampshire, showing a penchant for lacing barbs and self-deprecating humor into a fiery stump speech \u2014 a campaigning style he polished during three successful Senate runs in South Carolina. He\u2019s set up an exploratory committee called Security Through Strength, and the senator is now leaning toward launching a run this spring. ", " Graham says he will address his skeptics head-on, aggressively explaining his arguments that a president deserves to have well-qualified nominees; that both sides need to give a little to put the country on a sound fiscal path; and that a major immigration bill is the way to deal with the range of problems to fix a broken visa system and lax security at the borders. Overall, the message he plans to espouse: It\u2019s better to have a president who is pragmatic than an ideological hard-liner. ", " \u201cThis campaign will be focused on a heavy dose of realism \u2014 surrounded by optimism if we make the right policy choices,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what I think is possible in terms of the current political construct and how to grow conservatism. But at the end of the day, it will be focused on problem-solving, which will require a certain level of realism and bipartisanship.\u201d ", " If I run, we\u2019re going to have a debate about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. ", " \u201cIf I run, we\u2019re going to have a debate about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not,\u201d Graham added. ", " Graham would be a factor if only for the basic fact that he hails from South Carolina, which hosts the first presidential primary in the South in 2016. If he makes enough headway in one of the first two states \u2014 more likely New Hampshire than Iowa \u2014 Graham and his team believe he can pull off a win in his backyard of South Carolina. ", " Graham and Cruz get along well. They traded jokes sitting side-by-side at the State of the Union speech in 2014. And when the Texas Republican visited Charleston last April, Graham lavished his colleague with praise, noting in particular foreign policy views that align with his own. ", " Yet the two men represent the opposite wings of the party, which have frequently sparred since Obama took office: The no-compromise, tea party conservatives who believe Republicans need to return to their roots vs. the deal-making Republicans who argue that the GOP needs to be pragmatic in order to govern in a divided Washington. ", " That debate is bound to get more pronounced as campaign season takes shape. ", " \u201cHe realizes in the legislative branch, compromise is a principle you can\u2019t do without,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the president pro tempore, referring to Graham. \u201cThat\u2019s a very important thing where some of the others may not have that same attitude.\u201d ", " In some ways, Graham is mimicking the style of his closest friend in the Senate, John McCain. The Arizona Republican won the GOP nomination in 2008 on his \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d pushing an aggressive foreign policy view that he used as a cudgel against primary foes, like Mitt Romney, who lacked experience on the global stage. Similarly, with foreign policy emerging in 2016 as a top-tier issue \u2014 stemming from growing concerns surrounding the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Iran and Russia \u2014 a candidate with a history of espousing hard-line national security views could penetrate among the GOP electorate, Graham\u2019s allies say. ", " But the comparisons to McCain cut both ways.

But it came to national attention last year, when Philips launched a group called \"Vote Hope,\" with the goal of helping Obama collect early votes in the California primary, in which voters could mail in their ballots well before election day. Obama\u2014who at the time was criticizing his rivals' support from outside groups\u2014sent the group a letter stressing that supporters should give directly to the campaign, and the Clinton and Edwards campaigns pointed to its existence as a mark of Obama's hypocrisy on outside groups. ", " Obama's stated hostility to independent groups didn't shut down PowerPAC, but it did significantly dampen the flow of money to other ambitious Democratic efforts. Now PowerPAC is among the few independent organizations left supporting Obama. The largest may be America Votes, which coordinates the field organizing of liberal groups, while labor unions are also spending heavily. ", " PowerPAC is organized as a 501c4 non-profit, so it isn't required to disclose its donors or much of its spending. It reported spending more than $642,000 in direct electioneering\u2014television ads and direct mail\u2014in the primary. Phillips said it spent much more mobilizing voters, an expense which doesn't need to be reported. The group has access to cash\u2014Phillips is the son-in-law of Herb and Marion Sandler, among the largest Democratic donors in the country\u2014though he said he'd been raising outside money for this effort. ", " In the primary, the group aired radio ads urging black voters to participate, and worked with black groups to encourage turnout in the south and also to turn out Latino voters in states including California and Texas and encourage them to support Obama. ", " Philips said that, despite the campaign's letter, he sees his group as operating within the spirit of the campaign. ", " \"Our understanding of what they're saying is they don't want negative attack ads by outside groups, and we've always respected that and honored that,\" he said. \"We've never understood them to say they don't want community based groups increasing civic engagement\u2014that's the tradition Barack comes out of himself.\" ", " For the general election, the group is launching two projects. In the black south, it's going to finance existing African-American groups, like local NAACP chapters, to register and mobilize voters. Because Obama has built his campaign largely on volunteers and newcomers to the political process, Philips said, there's a cadre of experienced black organizations and organizers left to be mobilized. ", " The group will do voter registration work in Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia, Philips said. Philips, who came of political age on Jesse Jackson's campaign for president, said he thought the increases in minority voting this year could transform local political landscapes as Jackson did. ", " \"It could work the same way, if not even bigger than the Jackson campaign,\" he said. ", " Philips said his group would spend about seven million dollars in the South, leaving about three million for advertising targeting Hispanic voters in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas. ", " Obama aides declined to comment on the group's efforts, and also played down the impact of outside groups. ", " Phillips, though, said he hoped he was building the beginnings of a progressive infrastructure that could stand outside, and to the left of, an Obama presidency.

But he faces several obstacles to being considered a serious rival to Clinton for the nomination.

", " He has also said he does not believe he can raise the billion-plus dollars a winning presidential campaign is expected to take in. \u201cRight now that\u2019s not the top priority,\u201d he said on Thursday about fundraising. \u201cI want to make sure people know I\u2019m serious about my record, promoting the character I\u2019ve displayed.\u201d ", " He is, however, putting some pressure on Clinton, who some in the party believe could use some roughing up in preparation for the later stages of her White House run. Other Democrats considering a run have leveled implicit critiques of Clinton in recent months, but so far only Chafee has been willing to attack her directly. ", " Since the launch of his exploratory committee last Thursday, Chafee has been sharply critical of the former secretary of state, telling POLITICO last week, \u201cAnybody who voted for the Iraq war should not be president, and certainly anybody who voted for the Iraq war should not lead the Democratic Party into an election.\u201d Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He endorsed Barack Obama for president in February 2008, by which time he was an independent.

", " McDaniel supporters are irate that Cochran won a GOP primary by reaching across the aisle. Now some of his backers are ambivalent about whether they\u2019ll come out at all in November \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, that could create a rare opening for a Democrat here. ", " For his part, Childers said he is prepared to take on the Mississippi Republican machine and recapture the black vote that went for Cochran in the primary runoff. He also wants to take a page out of the Cochran campaign\u2019s playbook \u2014 expand the electorate. ", " \u201cAnyone who says it is an easy sail to victory for [Cochran], or anyone else, I would remind them that this seat isn\u2019t owned by anyone but the people of the state of Mississippi,\u201d Childers said. \u201cThere are a lot of disenfranchised Republican voters out there.\u201d ", " The real question for Childers is what will those tea party activists who fervently supported McDaniel do. Frustrated by Cochran\u2019s campaign tactic of trying to get Democrats who didn\u2019t vote in the June 3 primary to cast a ballot in the runoff Tuesday, many McDaniel supporters at his election night head quarters furiously chanted, \u201cWe\u2019re not going with Thad.\u201d ", " Childers said he is going to be going after every eligible Mississippi voter. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve had broad support before of Republicans, independents, my message to any Mississippi voters is you are welcome in our camp,\u201d Childers said. \u201cWe have enough seats at the table. \u2026 You don\u2019t have to sit on the floor and you don\u2019t have to eat crumbs.\u201d ", " In part, for Childers to just run a competitive race is helpful to Democrats. By expanding the map, Childers could force Republicans to spend money in Mississippi, thus diverting it from other states as they try to gain the Senate majority. Outside Republican groups dumped millions into Mississippi in the 2014 cycle, an enormous sum compared to previous cycles. ", " Childers said he hopes the GOP stops dumping in so much money but acknowledged that he, too, will need cash from national Democratic groups to make inroads in the state. ", " Childers will also have to motivate black voters and moderate conservatives to vote for him, much as he did in the 2008 special election in which he won his House seat. A conservative Democrat, Childers has opposed gay marriage, is anti-abortion and anti-gun control. Still, he found himself swept out of office in 2010 following voter frustration over President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, although he didn\u2019t support it. ", " National Democratic operatives have been focused on Mississippi for months. Several senators, including Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Michael Bennet, have already ", " contributions to Childers from their political action committees. Childers also banked significant cash at an April fundraiser in Washington at which House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer cut him a check for $2,500. ", " The Mississippi Democratic Party is nearly nonexistent and doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure to try and mount a credible campaign against Cochran. He will be counting on Democratic outside groups and the party committees \u2014 many of which have already pledged support \u2014 to funnel in money in order to make an aggressive play for the seat. ", " Some conservative activists think Cochran\u2019s primary runoff victory will ensure his defeat in November. ", " \u201cThere is zero chance of him winning because he is so vilified,\u201d said Ray Nicholson, founder and former chairman of the Mississippi Tea Party. \u201cHe\u2019s so alienated at least half of the Republican Party that they are not going to come out for him.\u201d ", " Laura Van Overschelde, head of the Mississippi Tea Party, said the group has \u201c180,000 voters who said no to the political machine\u201d in the McDaniel-Cochran race. ", " It\u2019s unclear whether they will make a concerted effort to thwart Cochran\u2019s campaign. ", " Barry Neyrey, chairman of the South Mississippi Tea Party, said that, though he is frustrated, it is hard to imagine a Childers victory in the Magnolia State. ", " \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine that [Cochran] would lose. Mississippi is conservative,\u201d Neyrey said. \u201cThere is still a chance to have Republican control of the Senate. As angry as we\u2019ll be, we still have common sense, and we can\u2019t let communists take over the country.\u201d ", " Childers said many Mississipians feel as though they\u2019ve been forgotten. ", " \u201cThere is a reason, because Washington, D.C., can\u2019t hear these people. I don\u2019t fight and argue all the time. I don\u2019t try to be disagreeable.

You publish whatever colorful lies people toss your way, for their own obvious political purposes?\u201d Grayson asked via text message. ", " Tester\u2019s spokesman at the DSCC declined to comment. However, in multiple interviews with Democrats from Washington to Florida, it\u2019s clear that the Montana senator tried to pressure Grayson to stay out of the Senate race because Democratic establishment figures believe he\u2019s unelectable in a statewide race. ", " \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Grayson said, likening Murphy to a piece of excrement. \u201cWhen I\u2019m a senator, it\u2019s going to be hard to work together.\u201d ", " If that happened, Tester chuckled, he was certain they would be able to work together after all. After the conversation, sources said, Tester made up his mind not only to support Murphy but to publicly endorse him and steer more money to his campaign. ", " The DSCC decision and conversation clearly surprised Grayson, who is still mulling whether to officially get in the race. Weeks before, he made sure to boast about meeting with the DSCC, and he went out of his way to cast doubt on a previous POLITICO report that said Murphy was favored by Senate Democratic leaders. ", " Already known for his outspokenness, Grayson became more irascible after the conversation with Tester and lost his cool with three separate reporters from different media outlets. ", " The most recent case occurred Wednesday when Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith phoned Grayson to ask the Orlando Democrat about having incorporated a couple of Cayman Islands hedge funds where potential investors could avoid taxes. At the same time, Grayson has built up his public persona as a populist Wall Street-bashing firebrand who criticizes conservative tax-avoiders. ", " \u201cWhen I set up my investment funds I set it up like everyone else,\u201d Grayson ", ", saying he established the funds on the advice of an unnamed attorney. The paper, he said to Smith, was trying to find \u201csome stupid, bull\u2014\u2014 story. \u2026 You want to write sh\u2014 about it, and you can\u2019t because not a single dollar of taxes has been avoided.\u201d ", " Since no funds had yet been invested, Smith asked about the propriety of establishing the funds in anticipation of getting foreign investors. ", " \u201cAre you f\u2014-ing kidding? I set up a fund that might solicit foreign investors. \u2026 I have no present intention of soliciting foreign investors,\u201d Grayson said, according to the report. \u201cYour perception issue is bulls\u2014-.\u201d ", " Grayson then began complaining about ", " that reported his girlfriend, biotech entrepreneur Dena Minning, had reached out to at least one Democratic-leaning group to put herself forward as a potential congressional candidate to run for Grayson\u2019s Orlando-area House seat if he runs for the Senate. Neither Grayson nor Minning would comment to POLITICO, but he brought up the story to Smith when he trashed the new line of questioning about his finances.

You go around s\u2014-ing on \u2026 people?\u201d ", " Smith wasn\u2019t the only reporter to bear the brunt of Grayson\u2019s rage recently. After a POLITICO story ran last week, Orlando Sentinel reporter Scott Powers finally reached the congressman on his cellphone. Grayson refused to comment but instead swore at Powers using the f-word. ", " Powers wouldn\u2019t comment on the conversation but confirmed he was unable to get anything printable from Grayson.

But how does he win in North Florida, how does he win Tampa Bay Democrats, where the sentiment is much more moderate?\u201d ", " Vancore likened Grayson to Allen West, the outspoken former Republican congressman and tea party darling who lost a conservative-leaning seat because of his over-the-top antics. \u201cAlan Grayson can raise money from a portion of the MSNBC-watching crowd, but he has zero appeal in the middle,\u201d said Vancore. \u201cAnd in the end, Democrats are like Republicans: They want a candidate who can win a general election.\u201d ", " Democrats hope Murphy\u2019s fundraising ability and his centrist voting record will be a plus in the general election. But Grayson and his backers say Murphy\u2019s record hasn\u2019t been Democratic enough and make him vulnerable in a primary. ", " At the same time, conservative GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis has announced his Senate candidacy and is expected to face a challenge from Lt. Gov. Carlos L\u00f3pez-Cantera. Just as DeSantis is running to the right, Grayson looks like he plans to run to the left in his primary. ", " Grayson gained a measure of fame among liberals at the height of battle over Obamacare.

Grayson became the progressive counterweight to the tea party. And campaign contributions flowed. ", " Later that year, he started a website called NamesOfTheDead.com, aimed at drawing attention to a Harvard University study that said every year, more than 44,000 Americans die because they don\u2019t have health insurance. Republicans said the site violated House and campaign finance rules because it linked to Grayson\u2019s campaign website, while ", " that several fake names were on the list, including \u201cWile E.

", " The \u201cdie quickly\u201d incident was not Grayson\u2019s only controversial incident. In 2009, he called lobbyist Linda Robertson, an adviser to then-Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, a \u201cK-Street whore,\u201d in a radio interview. He later ", " for the comment.

Bush White House. \n ", " ", " But, Fleischer adds, there are some signs of a philosophy: \u201cIt seems as if he will come out of the more muscular peace-through-strength wing of the party,\u201d Fleischer said. \n ", " ", " Indeed, some of Bush\u2019s most important allies within the GOP foreign policy establishment are closely associated with his brother, whose name is almost synonymous with a war in Iraq that most Americans call a mistake. \n ", " ", " Jeb Bush\u2019s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is a board member of an education foundation Bush chairs, and with whom he is personally close. And soon after leaving office in 2009, Cheney, who cares most about national security, told Fox News that he is \u201ca big fan of Jeb\u2019s.\u201d Bush has also impressed one of the GOP\u2019s wealthiest donors, the hawkish casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. \n ", " ", " Conservative foreign policy insiders say that what\u2019s known about Bush\u2019s views places him in the dominant interventionist wing of his party, which is still shaped by his co-signatories on the 1997 Project for the New American Century document. He has challenged the anti-interventionist views of Sen. Rand Paul and his supporters. \n ", " ", " But those conservatives also note that while Jeb\u2019s brother, George W., is remembered for a controversially bold foreign policy, his father, former President George H.W. Bush, charted a more pragmatic approach. The elder Bush, for instance, did not act to remove Saddam from power after expelling him from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. \n ", " ", " Jeb Bush is \u201ca traditional Republican internationalist,\u201d says Gary Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a founder of the Project for the New American Century. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything out of the mainstream of that part of the party.\u201d \n ", " ", " Still, Bush could face a unique challenge in his direct relation to the president who waged a hugely unpopular war in Iraq. \n ", " ", " While George W. Bush\u2019s poll numbers have risen since he left office, public opinion about his 2003 invasion of Iraq hasn\u2019t budged. A mid-October NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 66 percent of of those surveyed believe the Iraq War was \u201cnot worth it.\u201d \n ", " ", " After signing the Project for the New American Century\u2019s 1997 founding principles, Bush had no visible role as the group\u2019s leaders pressed in subsequent years for a U.S. showdown with Saddam. (Schmitt downplayed the significance of Bush\u2019s signature on the founding document. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that tells you very much,\u201d he said.) \n ", " ", " And during his brother\u2019s presidency, Jeb Bush largely avoided the explosive politics of the Iraq War. \n ", " ", " But not entirely. In April 2006, Bush joined three other governors to visit U.S. troops in Iraq, where he called progress in the country \u201cundeniable,\u201d even as Iraq descended into civil war. \n ", " ", " Jeb Bush\u2019s allies include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. | AP Photo ", "\n  ", " ", " Yet Bush qualified his support for the endeavor, adding: \u201cIn a mission this ambitious, and this extensive, is it possible that mistakes were made? Of course, it is. After the fact, it\u2019s easy to harp and to criticize, and, frankly, people have the right to do it.\u201d \n ", " ", " His more recent public remarks on the war have been less equivocal, however. \n ", " ", " \u201cA lot of things in history change over time. I think people will respect the resolve that my brother showed, both in defending the country and the war in Iraq,\u201d Bush told CNN in March 2013. \n ", " ", " Walking a line between support for his brother, still popular among Republicans, and distancing himself from his more unpopular policies, will be one of Jeb Bush\u2019s main challenges, says Peter Feaver, a George W. Bush White House national security aide who focused on Iraq. \n ", " ", " \u201cI think any Republican is going to have to figure out how to talk about the [George W.] Bush presidency \u2014 both domestic policy and foreign \u2014 in a way that does not divide the party and does not play into Democratic critiques. And also to make it clear that they\u2019re their own person, and they are confronting the world as it is in 2016 and not merely stuck in 2002,\u201d Feaver said. \n ", " ", " \u201cJeb\u2019s challenge is a little different because of his last name. But in some sense, he has more running room because of that \u2014 he can offer criticisms without being accused of disloyalty,\u201d Feaver added. \n ", " ", " For the moment, Bush has refrained from analyzing his own party and stuck to attacks on President Barack Obama. He has mocked Obama\u2019s so-called leading from behind strategy and called for a stronger U.S. alliance with Israel and a tougher stance on Iran. All were familiar talking points in Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. \n ", " ", " Bush sounded similar themes in a March address to a meeting of Adelson\u2019s Republican Jewish Coalition, where he assailed Obama as passive and warned conservatives against the temptation of withdrawal from the world. Bush also met privately with Adelson and satisfied him on the issue he and his wife hold most dear. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe Adelsons are confident that Jeb Bush is an advocate for Israel,\u201d says a source close to the couple. \n ", " ", " More recently, in a Dec. 2 speech to a Florida group that backs democracy in Cuba, Bush said Obama has \u201cretrenched\u201d abroad, with dangerous consequences. \n ", " ", " \u201cIn this unstable and uncertain world, the United States has actually played a part in creating greater instability and greater unraveling,\u201d Bush told the U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC. \n ", " ", " Bush did offer one kind word for the president. \u201cThankfully, I think he\u2019s seen the light in Afghanistan,\u201d Bush said, an apparent reference to Obama\u2019s recent extension of some U.S. combat operations there. But he added that withdrawing troops from the country \u201csimply because it is politically expedient is the wrong thing to do.\u201d \n ", " ", " In the same remarks, Bush suggested that a hasty exit created the current crisis in Iraq. Some Republicans think the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant offers Bush a potent comeback against assaults on his brother\u2019s legacy. \n ", " ", " And they note that the most likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, will be constrained in her discussion of Iraq by her 2002 Senate vote to authorize military force against Saddam\u2019s regime. \n ", " ", " Even so, Democrats would be sure to hang Jeb Bush\u2019s brother\u2019s unpopular foreign policy legacy around his neck. In response to Bush\u2019s December remarks in Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said Obama had restored America\u2019s standing \u201cafter the disastrous foreign policy blunders of the George W. Bush administration.\u201d \n ", " ", " The same arguments may also come from within Bush\u2019s own party, where Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is harshly critical of U.S. intervention abroad and calls the Iraq War a colossal blunder. \n ", " ", " Some conservatives say Bush could respond by invoking the legacy of his father, who presided over the mostly peaceful collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and built a diverse international coalition behind the Gulf War. \n ", " ", " \u201cThe optimal Jeb Bush foreign policy would be something along the same principles as his brother George, but perhaps more savvy about carrying them out, with the hard-headedness of his father,\u201d Schmitt said. \n ", " ", " But Jeb Bush himself rejects the idea that his brother\u2019s legacy presents any special problem. He addressed the question on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in March 2013. \n ", " ", " \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any Bush baggage at all,\u201d he said. \n ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " \u201cThis story doesn\u2019t alter my opinion of Hillary,\u201d said Martin Peterson, chairman of Iowa\u2019s Crawford County Democrats, \u201cbut it does alarm me that she is a lightning rod for any type of criticism of invented scandals by the opposition.\u201d ", " At the moment, Democrats continue to present a largely united front in their public support for Clinton and in their belief that the email issue isn\u2019t one that will ultimately matter to voters. ", " But while the overall message of trust in the presumptive frontrunner is clear, the saga is also exposing deep party-wide anxieties about having so much invested in a single candidate, more than 20 months before November 2016. ", " \u201cIt adds more reason to get other people involved in this process, to make sure we have other strong, good candidates running,\u201d said Larry Hogden, chairman of Iowa\u2019s Cedar County Democrats. \u201cBecause, who knows? She could implode totally.\u201d ", " Some locals are \u201cwringing their hands and shaking their heads,\u201d said Linda Nelson, chairwoman of Iowa\u2019s Pottawattamie County Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s just one more straw that can break the camel\u2019s back, in their eyes.\u201d ", " For many Democrats \u2014 even those who insist the email questions are unimportant to voters and little more than an optics problem for Clinton, ginned up by Republicans and fanned by cable news pundits \u2014 the moment has exposed a party that has few presidential prospects organized enough to fully test Clinton, or prepared to step into the void in the event that she falters. ", " \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from other people is that they want an actual primary,\u201d said Iowa City activist and blogger John Deeth. \u201cThe main problem with this whole email thing is that at the moment there\u2019s no real option. Jim Webb is not considered a serious option. [Martin] O\u2019Malley has got the problem of being considered another old white guy. The only viable option I see out there is [Joe] Biden, [Bernie] Sanders, and [Elizabeth] Warren.\u201d ", " Doug Grant, the Democratic chairman for northern Grafton County in New Hampshire, framed it this way ", " ", " \u201cIs Hillary electable? Admittedly the Republicans have a lot of problems with their candidates who are members of the slave- and serf- owning classes, but we worry nevertheless that one of them will become the next president,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see an alternative to Hillary who was popular, populist, wanted to run, electable, not too old and could raise money.\u201d ", " The predicament in which the party finds itself as it nears the sunset of the Obama era was laid out in stark terms in the recent Democratic National Committee \u201cautopsy\u201d report, which emphasized the need to build a strong party bench in the wake of sweeping electoral losses in 2014 from state houses to governors\u2019 mansions, to the Senate, and a broader hollowing out of the party infrastructure since Obama\u2019s election in 2008. The party\u2019s lack of depth at the national level is reflected in the flimsy emerging presidential field beyond the Clinton juggernaut, despite some activists\u2019 attempts to encourage popular figures to jump in the race to ensure Clinton is battle-tested before the general election. ", " It\u2019s a sign of Clinton\u2019s strength that none of the influential Democrats POLITICO surveyed on Wednesday or Thursday indicated that the email news would alone be enough to turn them away from Clinton entirely. The former senator and First Lady\u2019s allies have worked overtime to insist that the email flap is unimportant to Americans themselves. ", " \u201cVoters do not give a shit. They do not even give a fart,\u201d said longtime Clinton ally and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, echoing the sentiments of most Clinton allies who believe the all-but-certain nominee is enough of a defined quantity in voters\u2019 eyes that Republican attacks on her email policies cannot sway them \u2014 especially not over a year-and-a-half before she faces a competitive vote. ", " \u201cFind me one persuadable voter who agrees with HRC on the issues but will vote against her because she has a non-archival-compliant email system and I\u2019ll kiss your ass in Macy\u2019s window and say it smells like roses,\u201d he said. ", " Other Democrats were more measured, insisting that the news was worrisome and that the party should field more presidential contenders in case Clinton struggles in a serious way. But most kept their criticisms to a minimum, and just one early-state figure reported hearing from any of the other potential candidates since the news broke on Monday night. ", " Some of Clinton\u2019s financial backers are scratching their heads as the story has spiraled into a major point of conversation on cable news and radio, questioning the turbulent home-stretch of Clinton\u2019s pre-campaign phase. ", " One Democratic donor told POLITICO on Wednesday that Clinton\u2019s last few days have caused concern in New York\u2019s influential donor community. But most of her high-level donors have stood staunchly by her side, and Clinton had a chance to speak with many of her backers on Wednesday night as she headlined the Clinton Foundation\u2019s annual gala \u2014 which cost between $2,500 and $100,000 to attend \u2014 in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. ", " After disappointing several supporters by not addressing the swirling controversies during a Tuesday appearance in Washington, Clinton on Thursday added a Saturday stop in Miami to her schedule \u2014 a stop where many Clinton-watchers expect her to comment on the news. ", " Announced just hours after Clinton tweeted that she had asked the State Department to release her emails after reviewing them, the appearance will be at an event that was originally supposed to be hosted just by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. ", " After her stop in Miami, Clinton will return to New York for a pair of major events where she will unveil her much-anticipated report on the status of women and girls worldwide, alongside a slate of high-profile women. ", " Clinton\u2019s recent stumbles, however, have served as a reminder of her struggles during her summer 2014 book tour, despite the carefully designed sprint through March. ", " \u201cThere is some concern. Some people are saying, \u2018Is this going to blow up in her face?,\u2019\u201d said Jack Hatch, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Iowa governor in 2014. ", " Others see the ongoing questions as an indication that Clinton has to better manage her public image in the weeks before she officially announces her candidacy, if Democrats are going to win the White House. ", " \u201cThis is a signal, it\u2019s a warning, that whatever [else] there may be \u2026 get it straight, be prepared to be open with it, above board,\u201d said former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, noting that at a moment of deep public distrust of the government, the last thing Clinton needs is to come across as secretive. \u201cShe can\u2019t afford to give any impression that, \u2018This is the way it\u2019s going to be from the start of my campaign, or from my government.\u2019 I think they\u2019re aware of that.\u201d ", " The general trust in Clinton\u2019s ability to handle the situation is not universal, however. At least one outspoken Democratic activist who has a bad history with the Clintons seized upon the news to insist that others jump in the race. ", " \u201cHer [potential] campaign is so disdainful of anybody who raises any issues,\u201d said former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Dick Harpootlian, a long-standing booster of Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cYou need to get out ahead of it. How does she not see that one coming?\u201d ", " Biden has raised some eyebrows by appearing in New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina in recent weeks on official White House business, but the vast majority of Democrats concede it is highly unlikely that the 72-year-old vice president throws his hat in the ring. ", " Few of Clinton\u2019s possible rivals have spent much time in the early states this year, though former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley has been ramping up his travel after subtly jabbing at Clinton during a stop in South Carolina last weekend. ", " But O\u2019Malley is not expected to weigh in on the email saga before the weekend, and even his friends in early states say the controversy is overblown. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the news. My wife and I have sat together to watch it on the news, and we have not said a word to each other about it. I\u2019ve had no one \u2014 what\u2019s it been out, three days? \u2014 not one person has said a thing. Family, friends, people I\u2019ve run into, not one person has brought it up as a topic,\u201d said O\u2019Malley friend Dan O\u2019Neil, an alderman in Manchester, N.H. ", " O\u2019Malley is set to appear in New Hampshire and Kansas this weekend before a speaking engagement in Washington next week and a swing through Iowa later this month. And former Virginia Sen. James Webb formed an exploratory committee in November, but he has been largely quiet since then, despite scheduling one Iowa appearance for late March. ", " Craig Crawford, Webb\u2019s spokesman, said he doesn\u2019t think voters care about Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cThey\u2019d rather all be talking about jobs and the economy and how working people can get a leg up when wages are falling and income at the top is growing,\u201d he said. ", " Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist who is technically an Independent, continues to waffle over running. And the groups backing a run by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she won\u2019t run, are unlikely to weigh in on anything Clinton does as they stick to positive messaging and work to organize in Iowa and New Hampshire for Warren. ", " But while Republicans and reporters continue to dig into Clinton\u2019s email practices, a mix of concerned resignation and urgency has settled in among Democrats involved in the nominating process. ", " \u201cIt may continue to haunt her,\u201d said Mary Hoyer, chair of Iowa\u2019s Henry County Democrats, in an email. \u201cShe has to go on the offensive and find her message or she will never overcome these \u2018paper cuts.\u2019\u201d ", " ", " ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", " \u201cBackwards logic like this almost makes you understand why Wall Street executives are deluded enough to believe they shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for blowing up the economy in 2008 and fighting common-sense legislation designed to prevent them from doing it again,\u201d said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America. \u201cIf these guys actually believe that Cameron won because he bear-hugged billionaire bankers or think that Democrats will do better in 2016 if they continue treating a thief on Wall Street differently than a thief on Main Street, I\u2019ve got a tranche of decade-old, toxic mortgages I know they\u2019ll want to get in on.\u201d ", " Dennis Kelleher, head of financial reform group Better Markets, said many other factors were at play in the U.K. ", " \u201cClaiming the five-week sprint known as the U.K. election \u2014 and the Scottish freedom campaign \u2014 means anything for the U.S. is nothing more than wishful thinking by Wall Street\u2019s spinners,\u201d he said. Former \u201cSecretary Clinton will be spelling out pro-growth agendas that also protect the American people from Wall Street\u2019s dangerous too big to fail banks. It\u2019s not either/or. It\u2019s both.\u201d ", " The comments from Wall Street executives and conservative analysts come as some in the industry fear that Clinton will continue to move left on financial reform issues as her campaign progresses. ", " Clinton used her first trip to Iowa as an announced candidate last month to issue a fresh assault. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d she told Iowans, when \u201chedge fund managers pay lower taxes than nurses or the truckers I saw on I-80 when I was driving here over the last two days.\u201d ", " In a fundraising note last month, Clinton wrote that \u201cfamilies have fought their way back from tough economic times. But it\u2019s not enough \u2014 not when the average CEO makes 300 times what the average worker makes.\u201d ", " Wall Street mostly shrugged off those comments, confident that Clinton, who has enjoyed heavy financial support from the industry, would ultimately govern as a pro-business pragmatist not inclined to bust up big banks or support higher taxes on financial transactions or new controls on executive pay. ", " But as the \u201cDraft Warren\u201d for president movement continues to gain steam and coalitions of left-wing and right-wing populists in Congress flirt with the idea of breaking up the biggest banks, Wall Street is getting a bit more nervous. And it is pointing to the U.K. results and Republican gains in 2014 in the U.S. as evidence that Clinton should focus on other issues or face a possible loss in 2016. ", " \u201cI would say that this is the second major election in a row where bank bashing no longer seems to move voters,\u201d said a lobbyist for the banking industry. \u201cEven where voters may continue to have anger about banks, other issues seem to be driving their votes. We saw that last year in the U.S., and now we seem to be seeing an echo in the U.K.\u201d ", "Missing out on the latest scoops?

", "Story Continued Below", " Polling in the single digits and lagging top-tier competitors in fundraising, Booker this week sought to reboot his campaign, launching a \u201cJustice For All\u201d two-week, national tour heavy on economic policy proposals and social justice messaging. In Iowa, he rolled out an expansive proposal for a new income tax credit and talked about the need for rural infrastructure investment. In Georgia, he unveiled a voting rights plan, vowing to make Election Day a national holiday and talked about restoring voting rights to ex-felons. ", " The recent steps aim to invigorate a presidential bid that has underwhelmed some Democrats who are questioning whether Booker\u2019s message is one that resonates in the Trump era.", "Booker kicked off his presidential bid Feb. 1 framing his run on the proposition that the nation\u2019s next leader needed to tap into ways to reunite an ever-divided country. Booker, who often references Martin Luther King Jr., is shaping his candidacy as one that seeks to bring back civic grace and discourse, saying that political tribalism in America runs so deep \u201cwe can\u2019t even do the things that we agree on.\u201d", "The race for 2020 starts now.

", " It\u2019s a tricky platform to execute, said Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. While he said Booker\u2019s messaging is \u201ccompelling,\u201d it comes at a political moment when the party is hungry for candidates to offer up evidence that they can defeat President Donald Trump.

I understand that call, but it\u2019s got to be about something bigger than that,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe Democrats in this room, it can\u2019t just be about beating Republicans, no. This is a moral moment in our country where it\u2019s got to be about uniting Americans.\u201d ", " A March ", " in Iowa backs up Booker\u2019s premise: 50 percent of those surveyed said it was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d that a 2020 candidate is \u201csomeone who can heal the racial, ethnic and partisan divide in our country.\u201d", " Still, as he moves into the second quarter of the most crowded and diverse Democratic presidential primary in history, Booker is finding that the skills he's long tapped as an orator with a mayor\u2019s flair for finding human connection so far hasn\u2019t been enough to break through. On top of a slew of other U.S. senators in the race, fresh faces like former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are deploying similar retail traits to dazzle prospective voters. ", "So far, according to polls, O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg have ranked above Booker, who also trails top-tier candidates in the race including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.", "Likewise, Booker\u2019s first-quarter $5 million fundraising haul ranked below most other top-tier Democratic candidates.

", " With that in mind, Booker has shifted toward a more policy-heavy agenda in his two-week tour across the country that will take him to early presidential states and the South.", " In an Iowa event on tax day, Booker unrolled an expansive income tax credit, proposing to raise the Earned Income Tax Credit by 25 percent, aiming to significantly reach more people. ", " \u201cWe should be having the biggest increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit and that\u2019s what I\u2019m proposing, by making sure that anybody who works gets back from the government \u2013 if you\u2019re earning more than $50,000 a year, or if you\u2019re a couple, $90,000 a year -- you will get a tax credit in this country,\u201d he said. Then he gently jabbed at the crowd for failing to react. \u201cAnd by the way, before you even applaud, let me tell you,\u201d he said to laughter. ", " Even as Booker sought a recharge in Iowa, he was overshadowed by Buttigieg, whose unexpected surge drew among the biggest crowds for Democratic 2020 candidates touring the first-in-the-nation primary state. ", " \u201cI think part of it is the newness factor. We have a lot of great candidates in the field who are pretty well known. Pete\u2019s bubbled up because he\u2019s new and different. But also his demeanor, he\u2019s very chill, has a great sense of humor but he\u2019s very knowledgeable,\u201d said Vanessa Phelan, chair of Northwest Des Moines Democrats. ", " Phelan noted that while Buttigieg\u2019s crowd was unexpectedly large, she\u2019s seen many of the same people attending events for 2020 candidates as they\u2019re still shopping around. Asked if Democrats wanted to hear Booker\u2019s message of love and unity, she said they do \u2013 but that they want more. ", " \u201cWhat we all just really want is for the presidency to change hands,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a space for that message but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s resonating.\u201d", "Missing out on the latest scoops?
